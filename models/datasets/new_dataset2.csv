depression,"So im 29 and never had any problems with any substance abuse. Although alcoholism runs in my family i didnt touch it until i was 19 when i first got drunk...even then i wasnt doing it as much. When i tunred 21 i would go to college parties and get drunk but that was just a phase and wasnt doing it during the week or when i was class or work....by 23 i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression but i didnt go on meds and instead went to therapy/cousneling in dealing with this. Surprisingly this is when i stopped drinking as well. at 27 i moved out, was in the middle of a 3 year break from college and was working 70-75 hours a week. I began having bad insomnia and i began to drink wine before bed...Also this was also when i began to gain weight and continued until last year. I went from 195 to 220lbs...this was in 2019. 2020 rolls around and i decided to quit one of my jobs and go back to college. But obviously, the pandemic happened and my anxiety was at an all time high, quarantined also made my depression  worse since i wasnt going out and not being able to go see my friends. I wasnt eating and not feeling well. This resulted in me dropping 15lbs in less then a month without trying. Got blood work done and was told it was all due to stress but yet i physically felt sick. He prescribed me meds but refused to take them.  This is when i began to smoke weed very heavily. I was high 24/7 from the moment i woke up to when i went to bed. I was missing work and i didnt care about anything. Now weed has helped me enormously for my anxiety but the way i began using it was just overdoing it. this was going on about May of 2020...a year later it hasgotten worse. I ended up quitting my job due to wanting to focus on school full time for a year. grade wise i have been doing good. I did dropped 2 classes last semester due to feeling burnt out of online classes but i still did pretty well. I got a 3.0 gpa even tho it had been 3 years since i was in school.but i was also high 100% of the time during class. ATM im taking the summer off but this is mainly due to nit being able to afford taking summer courses.but now im just at home smoking all day. My anxiety has gotten bad again and im starting to not eat again.i do workout almost everyday and  it has helped me maintain the weight that lost and even more. In total ive lost almost 40lbs which obviously people have noticed i looked different but what they dont know is that even tho i look good outside, inside im screwed up. Ive started to smoke way too much again. I wake up anxious every morning and immediately smoke before i even have breakfast and usually i don't even eat breakfast or ill have coffee to get the buzz from the caffeine which mix with the THC makes me feel more energized without the caffeine making me anxioius. However,  My high lasts about 2-3 hours max and im smoking as soon as i feel like my high is coming down or if i feel my anxiety coming back. i know what im doing is just numbing my anxiety and depression without facing my problems and fears head on but idk how to do that. The anxiety makes me feel weak, on edge, my mind starts racing overall sick. the other day i caught myself smoking all day and couldnt remember the last time i went a day without smoking and just be sober. and tbh i dont want to think about trying to be sober. do you think i have a problem? i mean it's just weed right? Alcohol is worse and anxiety meds can make your life a living hell if you get addicted to those."
depression,"So for two days now i havent been feeling well. Ive been feeling very anxious and its giving me physical symptoms such as waking up feeling anxious with my stomach hurting. Feeling nauseas in the mornings and throughout the day. I had chinese food for lunch and puked it all up. I have no energy as well.ive been high all day to keep me from feeling anxious, it works for a bit but I'm realizing im just self medicating at this point and smoking non stop. how can i handle my anxiety without turning to weed? i do workout but we are in aheat wave atm and too hot to work out."
depression,"So ive struggled with anxiety since i was a kid. I wasnt offically diagnosed until i was 23 when i had my first mental breakdown, i literally thought i was dying and went to the ER and told me i was having a panic attack. i went to therapy and stopped at age 25. Last year At age 28 i had another breakdown. I was losing a lot of weight. Also at this time i was at my heaviest at 225lbs (im6'1) i went to 195lbs...fast forward to today im down to 182lbs but ive been working out and watching what i eat. im noticeable much thinner...however, i feel like shit. i do have a vitamin deficiency which i was told was the cause of me of not feeling well. this morning i woke up feeling anxious...my chest and stomach felt i had butterflies and the first thing i did was take a hit of my bong. I usually use weed for anxiety and stress since ive always been agains tmeds. today though  ive been smoking all day and its not helping as much. My anxiety would go away for only a bit and comes back.im just struggling rn and idk what to do. I cant afford therapy rn, doctors will just push meds on me. I just feel overhelmed."
depression,"Idk what in the universe is going on but I'm just not having it today. I woke up not feeling well, haven't eaten all day (currently making something to eat but I haven't had anything in my stomach). I went to the store to pick up a few things only to forget the very same thing I went in for. I come to my apartment and my cat pooped in the carpet which he has never done but it looked like diarrhea so I'm guessing he's sick which now I'm worrying about. He was dirty and smelled so I had to give him a bath which you guys can guess how that went. He scratched me I got myself and my bathroom all wet Was going to make some chicken that I bought and when I was about to cook it I noticed a bad smell and decided not to cook it. So now I'm just making a sandwich smh. Oh and also I'm moving different apartments and my lease ends at the end of the month and won't be able to move until mid august which means I have to live with my parents for 3 weeks and idk how my cat will like dealing with my parents dogs. I don't want to sound all whiny but I'm just over it Like My stomach hurts, I feel nauseas and the only thing that can calm is pot which I won't be able to do at my parents place."
depression,"Idk what's wrong but yesterday I went my cousins graduation and saw family I haven't seen over a year a lot has changed and it seems they got life figured out while I myself don't know what I'm doing. Im almost 30 and feel i haven't achieved anything in life, no relationship, still in school, changed careers and stress 24/7. I went to bed in a depressive mood and this morning I've been in edge. Rn I feel so irritated like I want to punch the wall and yell at the top of my lungs. I even smoked some weed to calm myself down and it isn't working. My mind keeps racing and I feel like I'm going to pop off. (Obviously nothing violent or self hard) but still idk what's going on with me today."
depression,"Im 29, turning 30 at the end of the year. And recently my depression has returned and going through lots of doubts and uncertainty about where my life is headed. At 23 I went through one and again at 26 seems like a cycle at this point. At 23 I started to go to therapy and it helped, at 26 I wanted to deal with it on my own but turned into going out and getting drunk to forget about my problems and anxiety. At 29 I don't drink as much but Im constantly smoking weed to deal with my depression and anxiety. Atm Im in college after taking 3 years off go work in my field only to decide that I'm changing my major and something completely different. I'm only a year from graduation but even then I have no confidence or excitement about my future. People my age are finishing their Masters, getting married and settling down. I feel like I'm playing catching up and I'm losing the race. Everyone tells me that your 30s is when you start living life. I'm hoping this is true because I hated my 20s. I was constantly worried about what others thought of me, I thought I was fat and unattractive. Now I'm the most physically active and skinniest I've been since high school, I still look young, and I don't feel ugly. Yet, the depression and anxiety will convince me other wise. Constantly comparing myself to others. This isn't how life should be lived. I just want to feel happy and everything I'm doing rn should be taken with patience and not rush myself. Like I'm excited to turn 30 after thinking throughout all my life that it's when your life is basically over. Obviously I don't think it is but I still have that anxiety attached to it. Idk if I'm making sense I'm just in bed with my cat rn contemplating on my life. And thinking if it's possible going through multiple quarter life crisis before hitting 30 lol Anyways, It's going to be one of those gloomy days for me. Hopefully, it gets better tho. Hope you guys are having a good day."
autism,"I met a Chinese girl on Internet we know each other since April. She told me she has bipolar depression and I went to her city because she lives in internet cafe and I wanted to help her with a place to sleep. Anyway she likes to talk to many people and spend hours in shops and overspending money she doesnt have... and now all is finished she puts a burden on me. Now this morning she came home from her job and picked up one of my shaving razors. I watched my phone  then she looked at me, I looked at her and seems she cut herself many times. I took toilet paper and but bleeding wouldnt stop. I ask her what happened and she said shes unhappy. I got a cold so we didnt have sex  maybe that's why shes unhappy? 8th I leave this place and maybe she afraid to be homeless again. So I will book a hotel for another week for her alone... evidence(gore): https://drive.google.com/file/d/16x5aAbCFCOo5fvtuLlnHd4aA-1x38Xzn/view?usp=drivesdk https://drive.google.com/file/d/16lFKeL4-6IqAVIh7SWuiCXpjTgo3N6dw/view?usp=drivesdk"
autism,"Day 1  I meet a local Taiwanese woman on a language exchange app. I live together with an older woman I met in 2017. She wants to come at the house.She says that she comes from Taichung and will arrive around 3 p.m., with her luggage. I refuse her and ask if a hotel is alright. She suddenly says that she has a boyfriend. I don't understand, she wants to stay at my place, but not hotel?I get kicked out of the house (the older woman thinks that I will have sex with her) and we meet.  She wants to go to the house, but I push her to the hotel.  Once arrived... She asks for my laptop. She wants to study English pronunciation. She also says that she has depression, and when she goes to see her boyfriend she feels unsafe.I shake her hand. She asks me if I have a car.  She laughs at me and after two hours leaves the place. I'm like: but I booked a room for two... She: but I have a boyfriend... and I need to return to the dormitory... Day 2 She sends me a message, asks me if I can come. I ignore her and she magically appears in at the hotel, from her city it's 30 min by motorcycle. We take a picture together.  After that I got a message from the older woman to return. She also wants to go. I refuse and we stay at the coffee shop instead. I pay for her. It's funny, we make a lot of sexual jokes on the computer.  We go to the doctor to get her medicine and she starts to cry. She says that her boyfriend says ''you have food, people in Africa don't have so why are you depressed. ''. I shake her hand and say ""I will forever be with you. I know your pain.'' She shows me that she swallows 8 !! medicines. Afterwards she brings me to a pier and says ''I want to be with you but I don't know, my feelings change. Sometimes I don't want to return to the dormitory. ""' and ''I feel like you only want me because I'm not yours yet.'' I also suffer from depression and Insomnia, but when she messages me, I feel very good.  Upon returning home she sends me messages, I say I like her and she says asks to delete it. Quite manipulative.Day 3 Early day she says good morning,  and asks me if I can come. I say no, and she says bye. Suddenly she appears at the coffee shop and she calls me. I feel that she won't last long. She has video call with her boyfriend and attacks me. ""'I waited 30 mins!!!'' I said but you came unexpected and I didn't shower yet. She buys clothes and we go to another cafe and I treat her again. We sit many hours and feel happy next to her. I wrote a resume for her. My eyes hurt very much. She says ''I don't mind if you have sex a girl me if you spend a lot of time and money on that girl'', and ''my previous boyfriend broke up with me after I let a man who came to my house kiss me''. We go to the barbershop and she cuts her hair. She leaves me at the station and sends me many messages. She says why don't you cut your hair, I say I don't like short hair, then she says so you don't like me,  I say I always think about you, then she says don't do that. Day 4 I say to her that she reminds me of another girl that has BPD, and I also liked her very much. She is angry and I unsend the message, then she says why unsend.  I send heart icon but she says that she wants to preserve relationship and asks to me stop ''kiss'' ''heart'' emoticon. Day 5 She goes to Northern Taiwan to meet her boyfriend and have a job interview.I want to message me but I want to know if she thinks about me when she's with her boyfriend. I wait... and received a message.  I feel good. I didn't meet her so I had insomnia, I sent her love horoscope between Aries and Leo. She says don't send it because she is with her boyfriend.Day 6 She spent one night at her boyfriends house but says she will return early morning because she wants to see me.Why not spend the entire weekend with your boyfriend, you love him, right?She says to me that a friendship lasts longer than bf / gf. After arriving, she acts stupid so that I come to help her on the computer. However I don't go meet her. I don't know what I am to her. A friend? A lover? Just being used? I refuse to go and actually want to end the relationship. I do love her and want to meet her, but I don't want her to use this weakness. She sends me a lot of messages, asking me to help her with correcting English documents. Then she suggests to meet the next day.She said that I can be honest and  that she will still be my friend?.Day 7 She wants me to come to her city.  Actually it was a lie...She said that wants to go to my house because she doesn't want to cry in public. That was also a lie.  She was at the coffee shop the entire time, testing me...  Her Chinese is also messed up (perhaps she is seeing me as an idiot).  I treat her again and spend the entire afternoon to correct her English.She shows me her iphone chat history and I see her asking a man for money and housing...  She talks fondly about me, however. I manage to hug her and kiss her on the right cheek. Her eyes sparkled.Afterwards her friend Fufu comes in and they are trying to trick me into paying their food, because they were quarrelling about paying food. Day 8 She asks me if I slept well. She said that she going to treat me on a cup of bubble tea but she has no money as student.  Now I'm starting to think maybe she is my friend? But later she sends me many messages, asking me again to correct her English. I feel that she wants to meet, but just doesn't want to say it because then she has to come from far away. I also want to see her daily, but I don't want to appear weak and clingy. She is sad that we didn't meet. On days I don't meet her I cannot sleep. I miss her. Day 9 She sends me a good morning message.  Then various heart icons, and says that she wants to come early because it's hot outside. Once arrived at the coffee shop, I give her chocolates as present. She had forgotten to bring her wallet. I treat her to breakfast,  she doesn't let me hug her, but I kiss her cheek and she comes closer and we touch each other gently. Outside she is super happy. We go to the department store and treat her on Sushi. She treats me on bubble tea. Her friend (same as previous day) comes...  She doesn't like it when I'm together with her. The woman brings me to the station and I say I love you.  Afterwards she sends me some messages. Day 10 I stay in a hotel. I talk about similarities between her and another woman with had BPD I also loved. I tell her that we should end this relationship because I know she will be my enemy one day.  She will meet another boy on the app and I'm sure her borderline personality disorder will control her and erase me. She wants me to come, she says that she is tired and wants to meet but that the hotel I stay at is very far. We decide to rest. Day 11 She comes to the hotel. She wanted to know how much the hotel costs. She watched some movie on my laptop. She skipped to the sex scenes (no nudity, suggestive). I thought that maybe she wanted sex. I tried, but she rejected me Maybe she was on her period, because she asked me for tissues. After 45 minutes we went outside. She paid food for me, and asked how much the hotel costs. I lied and she said ''I know that it costs...''.I bought a screen protector for her iphone.Because I said if I leave Taiwan I want to let you know that I'm always by your side protecting you.We went to the mall, treated her on bubble tea and chicken. She said that she wanted to go to Japan to live together with me.  She gave me a hug and we separated. ""When you are happy, I'm happy too'', she said. Day 12 〜 13 Warning! She sends me a message that she dreamt the screen protector to be broken again. I notice her being online a lot on the app we met. she also stops messaging me. I sense distance. In the first 2 weeks she was never online.Maybe she doesn't like the fact that I live in cheap hotels (gold digger), maybe she expected me to violate her (sex) but I didn't. Or her mental illness devaluating me, and idealizing someone else. I meet someone else and she suddenly starts questioning me a lot. Suddenly, she begs me to not stop chatting. I felt very good talking to her all night. Very happy, I couldn't sleep. Day 14 She is online all day. She doesn't try to meet me again. When I create distance she says that she wants to meet tomorrow. She says that she is just bored being on bed all day, and I'm a friend to her. Day 15 She doesn't want to meet me, she is looking for a new partner. When I try to leave her she chases me and deceives me. Again, all day on the app, and I don't like it. I post a negative review and she attacks me. She says that she will kill herself.'Don't push me away! Let's be friends! We all need love! ' she says. Suddenly she wants to meet, and I want to meet to, but then she won't feel that my anger  is genuine. She offers me sex, but is afraid I will see her as a bitch. I think she doesn't want me to leave her. She becomes desperate.  She wants to thank me one last time and meet in person. I tell her that I'm stupid for not attacking her that day when she came to the hotel.  She tries to call me, I reject. She is scared I abandon her. ""Don't push me!'', finally she says that she likes me and will come to see me tomorrow. I actually wanted to see her today because I miss her. Insomnia.Day 16 I tell her that I forgive her and love her. She makes a stupid joke. We meet near the house and she brings me to the department store. She says that I'm a special person in her heart. She also makes sexual jokes. I pay for her macdonalds and she tells how she wants to go to another island to find a job. I'm a little bit sad because I don't want to leave her. She says that I can visit her anytime. Later, she brings me to the doctor because she is out of medicine.Outside she says that she will miss me and see me off when I leave Taiwan. Once inside, I notice her talking badly about me and hide the chat. I leave (act like I'm angry) and she begs me to return. The doctor gives her less medicine. Apparently, being with me has a positive influence on her wellbeing. Afterwards we go to the pier, she is very happy, sometimes holds my arm. She returns to her dormitory early. Later on a message that she forgot medicine in my pocket, I didn't see any. Day 17 Strange day. She didn't get the job she wanted.  I lost my investment and my  account in the app where I met her. This time I went to her city for the first time and I she treated me on tea. I helped her with looking for a position as au pair.  She said that her friend doesn't want her to meet me, but I am in her heart so she will always be at my side when I need her. At the end of the day, She was invited to another job interview, I got my account and investment back. Day 18 Nothing much. Talk about Bitcoin and pachinko. I say that I will meet a friend tomorrow, and she doesn't want me to meet that person.Day 19 〜 the final day. She says I should meet my friend and have sex with her. I refuse. She asks me to come, but I'm tired so she comes instead. We meet and she says negative things about me. Like, that I will poison her one day. She is jealous about my relationship with the old woman I'm staying with. The old woman is my friend but she lets me stay at her house for free, gives me food every day, etc.I tell her that her boyfriend doesn't love her, I feel like that.  Because when she's in trouble he won't save her. I treat her two times, on food first then later on some drinks. At the end of the day I try to play with her hair and  she refuses. We talk about her boyfriend as she slowly drinks the juice, she doesn't want me to go home. This story made us break up:She met her boyfriend when she missed the bus to Taichung, and stayed at his house for two days. At day 2 he kissed her and she recognized him as boyfriend. He never confessed to her. I felt angry. I meet her 9 times, I confess many times on LINE, yet she won't let me hug or kiss her anymore?  I call him her sex friend and she is hurt. She brings me home and sends me message. Afraid I'd not like the story and block her. Day 20 ～ 25 Morning, message from her. She asks feedback about her boyfriend.Her boyfriend never confessed to her and she had a kiss with him after sleeping two nights at his house.She goes to Nothern Taiwan one time a month to sleep with him. In my opinion, she is a bad girl. I scolded her a lot. I called her a sl*t,  gold digger, deceiver, fraud. I told her to die together with her ugly sex friend.I also send pictures of us at the hotel to her friends, and she said that I'm funny because her boyfriend was not on instagram.She turned insane. She said that she only liked me as friend, and asks her ''boyfriend'' if she is his boyfriend, and shows me a screenshot of him saying yes. Day 23 she blocks then unblocks me. Day 24 she does that again, permanent block.Day 26 I try to reach her by mail, phone, maybe there is a misunderstanding. My friend also reaches her but no avail. Her BPD devaluated me. Finally, I notice her watching my Instagram, so I go to her University. She has seen it. However, no response. I deleted the Instagram account, and farewell. Now I'm very lonely. She healed my mind, I felt so happy... I wanted to see her every day... The weather is good... So what do you people feel about this story... Any kind of comment is welcome."

autism,"Anyone having chronic headaches and how do they cope with it?For me the headache started when I was 14 and never disappeared. Only the following helps: sleeping early, listening to music, warm weather, having friends by your side, staying in bed and avoiding stress. Just now I woke up with a splitting headache :*("
autism,"so first of all I have been abused since I was 6 years old.my father (who recently is diagnosed with recurrent bowel cancer) kept saying I was a worthless being, and kept hitting me with a broomstick on a daily basis and as I grew up it became more horrible: like before going to school I wanted to shower and he turned off the warm water in the middle of my shower (I barely entered) and I had to wash off soap with cold water and he slammed on door till I opened then slapped me on the face if I was angry. Or if I played SNES / Nintendo 64 for longer than 30 minutes he would lock me up in a dark room then push me in a corner and keep hitting me. Even if I played only 25 minutes, for example he would start doing it, so he was only trying to find a reason to hit me.  By the time I was 14 years old, it was midnight and nobody was home.   Normally I am not allowed to play on the computer but because it was the first time home alone and online in WoW I had friends which I could talk to, I decided to play, and all of sudden I was happy and euphoric, and then my brain suddenly felt numb.   then I slept for 1-2 hours and woke up, but I thought, hey this is a dream? so I purposely skipped school for a few hours and in the class I danced and was joking with the teacher - but then I was like huh? wait? This is real? Then I also had a headache suddenly that didn't go away. I consulted teachers / father but nobody was taking me seriously. the teacher saw me not talking to anyone else, and being very silent in the class, and looking at the ground and called in the school doctor, and they sent me to a mental ward (?) where one psychiatrist said I have asperger syndrome, and that it was permanent, maybe if I crossed 20 I would feel a little bit better. They put me on abilify, but it only made me sleepy.  Strangely, my school performance increased, like my mind gotten sharper? I said to the psychiatrist, maybe if I keep praying God will cure me! Then he responded: I personally don't believe in God and no matter how much you pray, miracles simply don't exist. It was a shocking experience.   Then many years later passed and I was about to finish school; as my school performance was good my father had more bouts of kindness but most of the time he would be very abusive, like I was playing a video game on the computer the government gave me, together with a friend and he suddenly came unplugged all cables, and smashed the computer on my head (desktop pc) my friend saw it. Another time I had a nintendo ds I borrowed from a friend in my pocket, and he pushed me from the stairs making the ds fall out of the pocket breaking something but I cannot remember well what broke. One time I fought back and I destroyed his glasses and he pulled me hard by my hair. next phase my father was going to work 2 days a week and he locked the pc away, turning the internet off. I figured that the neighbors have the same type of key and borrowed it, to open the door to enable the internet again. I also destroyed the green LED so nobody would notice if it was on or off (in case he would quickly check it out.I graduated and some games gave me courage, like kingdom hearts and final fantasy to move forward. I showered and washed my clothes when dad wasn't home, I started to shave my beard, nofap, and a friend gave me a psp so I could go on internet / facebook without needing to use a PC.Then a miracle happened. I met a Japanese woman on the Internet and after hearing my story, invited me over to JPN to her house. I thought: this is my new start. We had another fight (me and dad) and I torn 3-5 pictures of us together (I regret it now he's going to die soon) and left to JPN with school scholarship. Since I was sick with dr/dp, cptsd, asperger, i didn't need to pay it back, so I went there when I was 18. 3 months later I returned, because the visa couldn't be extended. Fortunately, my father was crying and happy that I was back, and he stopped hitting me, but still always cursing me.He bought a new Volkswagen and went to Iran while I had to trave to school, waking up at 5 a.m. and arriving at school late because I had to travel 3 hours with a train to school because they were the only ones offering Japanese language course. needless to say, I failed within one month because the teacher noticed I was different, and I always came late.   Then, my life changed completely.  the government said to me, you deserve a special income for the disabled, and they diagnosed me with rett. development disorder, asperger syndrome, complex post traumatic stress disorder. I also have chronic headaches that NEVER went away. After that I got homeless (kicked out) and stayed at different people's houses. I thought I will save money and try to live in Japan, but I was too naive, thinking that without a bachelors degree I would be able to live in Japan.   One of my best friends her mother offered me a place to stay.  After 1 year of Japanese language study, I bought an android phone, and installed a messaging app, and I was able to make many many many many friends online. All of them young women. I called many women on a daily basis and spoke to them in Japanese. I was naive again, thinking that I could marry one of them and live there (I was 19)  i went there and met a few online friends in real life, and lost my virginity, kissed a girl for the first time in my life, and the mother of one of my friends let me stay at their house. I was pretty happy, but still not improvement in symptoms (only the glassy feeling in the eyes reduced)  I came back after 3 months and the mother said I could stay only 1 week. I panicked but in the end they let me sleep on the sofa and didn't kick me out, I paid very little in exchange.months passed and I made friends in the same app, and this time the women were very sexual, and very aggressive. I also played horror games like fatal frame 3 that talks about ptsd like a painful tattoo on the back that spreads, nobody can see it, but yet it hurts. The atmosphere was great, and in february 2014, I met a woman who was very rich, but in her 30s, she already had children.I went to Japan again and it was the greatest time of my life. I went to a small island named Yorontou it was very calm, the sound of waves in the evening, sooo peaceful.I met many women and had sex, but strangely I could barely feel pleasure. It was simply not enjoyable (people say because I am circumcised, but there are plenty of people who are and still have a good sex life). I met the 30 year old woman and she cooked for me, bought clothes for me, basically the only thing I had to do was to have sex (I came only 1 time in her) but after some time I said to myself: ''sacrifice your disability income to live in JPN, and what if it doesn't work out? you will end up going to your own country with NOTHING'' (government allows people to travel, but living means end of income). In the end I declined to stay with her any longer and finished my trip. I met wonderful people. Very helpful, even paid flight ticket for me between 2 cities (fukuoka and niigata), another woman paid for hotel and we stayed together (no sex, I was tired), and many many friends who didn't ask for sex we ate together and went sightseeing walking hand in hand, looking at sakura blossoms, etc. Then when the travel ended, I was in the deepest hell. The app stopped working. I was alone. I was trying to save for school in JPN, again, impossible to achieve, but I was naive. I met nobody on internet. App is dead. Also I couldn't go outside or eat anything the woman I stayed with back in my own country kept asking for money, and I thought if I keep going outside and prepare food, she will know I have money, so I have to at least stay calm till the end of the year (2014) get a scholarship and try a Japanese course in Fukuoka. The school said I could obtain a visa and after the course I could go look for work! All was settled. I started to fantasize --- but made no friends. I couldn't eat. I stared outside every day. 2014 may till december were hell.One older friend paid me a ticket to JPN to see her, and sent me food rations (rice, canned fish, canned chicken, candy) and suddenly... when I arrived there... I felt nothing! NOTHING! NUMB! No happiness. Why should I live here? I gave it up completely. I went back to my country and had to pay 7k euro for mental treatment, and it was a shock!!! 7k for someone on disability income, its way too high. I was fighting for 7 months and finally in july 2015 the mental ward people apologized, and I only had to pay 1k for 2014, which I agreed upon. I also became vegetarian, hoping it would help. I ate only fruit, because it doesn't need cooking but I became constipated, jaundice, etc my health was deteriorating so I added raw fish (herring) and raw eggs to my fruit / nuts diet, and was able to function. My mental health went from bad to worse, BUT my physical strength improved tremendously, I had more energy, I took cold showers and lost weight (avg 65 kilo, weighed 58 and my length is 1.86).  Next, my days consisted of, walking outside, buying food, binge on food, sleep, cold shower, repeat.  Then 2016 came. I decided that after 4 years of not seeing dad, it would be fine to become friends again. On new years eve I posted a chocolate at his house and left my number. He said, I love you, please come to my shop.  There he was, slightly balding, muscles weakened, skin aged, walking painfully. Running a grocery shop all on his own. I embraced him and cried. He also said to me what happened to you?! You look so depressed and old.  There I went, doing the same as before, but meeting him several times a week at his shop.I had an accident, I was on the bicycle heading to the church, and one car collided against me. Then... during summer 2016... A phone call from a hospital. I took my bike and raced there, something was found in his bowel. tumor / cancer. One doctor said he only would have 3 months left. Another doctor said it could be treated easily. I suggested him to try a vegetarian diet, but he kept smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, fried chicken and fried potato, with lots of dairy.  The woman kicked me out of house. I bought a tent (water proof), thick sleeping bag and slept in the park. Every morning I packed in, and went to the library to rest / charge my phone. I met some kind man, he offered me one bread with cheese and apple juice. I went to the toilet to cry. First guy in loooooooong looooong time who was kind to me. I became attached to him. I then had a message from the insurance telling me I have to pay 4k (!!!) for the damage to the car. Again, another shock.  As time passed, I started to become more and more numb.  months passed and it was October, cold outside. I was heading towards a friends place to install windows on her PC. (I am good in computer field), as I headed back home ''tent'', I met the husband of the woman from the first place I stayed. He brought me to a friend who let me stay at his house. I was hungry and cooked up potato, rice, eggs, I was malnourished on raw food diet. I ate a ton and my constipation was gone, and skin improved a bit, but my energy levels dropped significantly. after the month passed I had to become homeless again, but instead, a woman paid me a ticket to JPN, and I used it to stop over in Hong Kong instead. Luckily, they have free campsites to put a tent!!!! i also had a solar charger and even in the winter it was HOT. My phone charged up 100% every day, and made many many friends, who offered me tons and tons of food, and some of them even became long term friends. The weather was nice, the people were nice, no stress, sleep, eat, talk, enjoy. But my mental status was bad, horrible. I kept asking myself if it was the vegetarian diet to blame? Or simply traumatic experiences? January 2017, solar energy was not strong enough to power up my devices. I went to the nearest country Taiwan, and upon arrival, I had no energy. I slept at the airport, left my belongings there, went to the city Internet cafe to shower, and came back by evening, eating convenience food like peanuts.  They had computers there so I could update my blog, and I could charge my phone. There were no free campsites like Hong Kong, and I was kind of stuck. At the airport I met Japanese women who had problems with booking tickets back to their country (they missed their plane) and I helped them, they were very happy and we took a pic together and they left.  I also met a woman from Singapore and we made pictures together. The airport was a fun place. because greasy food messed me up I went to the city and prepared sweet potato at the airport, I got caught and the police found it funny (you are not allowed to use gas in airport). One woman working at a restaurant prepared the potatoes for me and gave me pineapple cakes.  After 2 weeks I headed to Kaohsiung and hid myself in the bushes.  One old lady who couldn't walk well, came to me every evening and gave me food.It was festive season (new year?) and there were no places to shower so one man who practices tai chi, had a student who offered me to their house for a shower!  after that I went to the swimming pool to shower every 2 days. Luckily, nobody stole from my tent. The woman visited me more times, and we became friends. Every morning she would come to my tent and we would eat vegetarian together (mushrooms, sweet potatoes, green veggies, seaweed) she was a heavy meat eater but still because she loved me, respected my dietary choices. i also charged my phone using solar charger and played kingdom hearts chain of memories on a gba emulator, haha.  eventually police came, and they said that there were many reports from people.  Strangely, they said to me to only camp during the night, and that they themselves don't really care if I camped or not. I removed my tent.  the woman then decided, come to my house.  We lived together, and I was able to recover a bit.  She asked me if I could extend my trip because the reason she cannot walk properly is because she had an accident and her ankle bones (?) were broken and she would need someone to look after her and push her on her wheelchair after surgery in march. I went to Japan for a bit, camped one night in a park in Fukuoka, it was 7 c celsius. The next morning I went to Internet cafe to shower and took a bus to Kagoshima to meet a girl and her family I hadn't met since 2014. I loved her a lot.She came home late and the police found me suspicious (I was lying on the ground near her apartment). I was brought to internet cafe, and then the girl came home and I embraced her, but strangely, I felt numb!!!! She let me stay in her house for 2 nights, while I met her mother again, and we had a family picture together. Her sis got married and have a very cute baby. After that I went to the older womans family in Nagoya (the one that bought me the ticket) and her husband and I had fun time together. Though, I suddenly became sick for 3 weeks, fever, I even thought I had AIDS so I went to the clinic for a free test (negative). I also had severe bout of insomnia. I thought I was going to die!!!  I canceled my Japan trip and returned to Taiwan, I recovered quickly but insomnia just wouldn't go away. The woman had surgery and I pushed her wheelchair every day, prepared food for her, and rested out the whole day.  Then I went back to my country, homeless. My first night I slept in the park.  BUT THEN! The man I met previously in the library, throughout the months we had contact and because I have some computer skills he asked if I could build a basic website for him. I did so, and he offered me a place to stay, there are no showers, but there is electricity, a roof, and most important of all, love. This guy on the first day was playing a lot of music, making a lot of jokes, he was very happy that I was back from my trip and I was like ''because I was homeless, I was able to make 2 fantastic friends, one in taiwan, and one in my own country''. He comes on a daily basis, and when I see him I was filled with warmth. I had also bought serotonin, phenylalanine, b12, many supplements, decided to go pesco vegetarian and my sleep improved.   I met daddy again and he was alive. But I felt so numb after I heard I lost the court case (accident 4k) and had to pay 3k. Months passed... and I feel so numb... so depressed... and just recently daddy said that his cancer returned. I feel numb, but in the evening when I lie on bed emotions start to come back and I start to get teary....so after 10 years: all of my dp dr depression symptoms became worse, and now I feel very numb, no interest in anything in life... doctor calls it anhedonia...  I want to hear the story of everyone here as well."
anxiety,"Hi All,I    hope you are all enjoying life, keeping safe and well. Especially   people who share my mental health illnesses. I'm going to keep this as    short as possible, so please don't deem me as being abrupt:1. About   me: I relied on alcohol for 16 months to get me through a period of my   life; I'm happily married five years, just had a child, moved house    (mortgaged), dealing with lawyers, a change in life circumstances, lack   of sleep, partner (off-work maternity) ... all just came at once (get   the violins out). The truth is, I've never been able to handle the   stress of any kind, in particular performance-related stress. The long   and short of it is, I've got a good life, educated, higher than average   IQ, always clumsy and not streetwise. That's me—any questions, fire   away, happy to expand.2. My    Issues: I haven't drunk alcohol/liquor since 22nd Feb this year, and    I'm not fazed by other's drinking around me. It actually repulses me,    just the sheer smell of it. For the first time ever, I went to see a    doctor, and she diagnosed me with two disorders: performance-related   anxiety and GAD, both conditions I had privately tested for my sanity    (and to act as the second opinion), and the scores were high. Now, I   enjoy my work role, but not the pressure thank's to the medication   provided  (please see point3). I work for a world-renowned organisation   in their data analytics team; I wouldn't be fit for any other work   because it gives me satisfaction and I am fully engaged.3. Reg.    medication: I'm en prescribed sertraline 100mg (started 50mg) since   1st  May, so just over 14 week's(almost 3 months), at first I felt   euphoric.  The propranolol 80mg time-released worked for my   performance-related issues. NOW I must admit, and I do not advise this -   but I see a private family doctor who prescribes me Diazepam by  signing  a  prescription paper. This leads me to point 4.4. Reg.    Addition - I find myself taking higher and higher dosages of each   medication to get that euphoric effect. Still, even at the standard   prescribed dosages, I was given, I no longer feel the benefits, apart   from the propanolol. It's the Diazepam and Sertraline, which makes me   feel grim and more than satisfied; all those moments, big or small in my   life, I feel no emotion or interest towards. This brings me to my  final  point.5. Reg.    Addition and Next Steps: Do you feel I should consult my doctor and   explain I no longer feel that sense of motivation and euphoria of living   life joyfully? I feel numb and almost robotic, but I know for a  fact,   the alternative is far worse. Perhaps it's a change in SSRI   medication I  require?"

anxiety,"Hi,Reg: Advice On Performance-Related Stress MedsI'm seeking advice on where It would be possible to purchase Propanolol from an online pharmacy without prescription.

Its taken me 11 years to identify and recognise my issues.I'm also keen to hear from people who have had similar experiences. It would be greatly received. I'll jump right into my issues, but I will briefly cover a little about myself and my background first.(o) BIO: Age 33, Male, Married (5 years) and 7-month-old daughter.  (o) CORE VALUES:Structure, Regiment, Routine, Sometimes Spontaneous. Passions - include boxing, although not due to covid for almost a year. Travelling and enjoying a range of activities with my wife and daughter. (o) PERSONALITY:I am introverted by nature, not so much in social environments, but significantly timid in work environment constructs.(o) WORK ANXIETY ISSUES:Feeling on edge in work environments, I tend to avoid interaction with business leaders and superiors where possible (physically)—preferring to email instead of call. I've always had an issue with authority (in a work capacity) unless its a leader who is invested in empathy and listening. I often always seem to clash unintentionally with my superiors, as they are pretty direct. I understand there need for this, but it causes me severe anxiety - it's just, I'm passionate about my industry and job, but it's the interaction part in a work context I struggle with.I prefer to work in my specialist marketing role (technically minded). It just so happens I have broader marketing skills that benefit the team/business, but this causes me tremendous stress, enough to paralyse me into inaction when tasked to work outside my specialist role.Presently, I'm working in a matrix organisation with many senior leaders/directors with lots of priorities. I find it hard to distinguish priorities and not the best at communication; however, on several occasions, I seemed to have delighted multiple director/heads with outstanding work output, evident by email applause and appreciation. This has been a repetitive behaviour for the last 11 years, just worsened as I've got managerial responsibilities and direct stakeholder KPI accountabilities. (o) CURRENT SITUATION:Off work temporarily due to mental health issues, living off my savings for now. I had  2 mental breakdowns, 3 months into a 6-month probation (in this existing job post), on both occasions, resulting in hospital visits, and finally, a diagnosis of GAD made.Work stresses are manageable if my Anxiety is under control, which clearly has worsened; this has resulted in insufficient task attention and misplaced judgement, inability to clarify actions were required internally or externally of the organisation with client's I work for and prioritisation on recent tasks.To cope with work stress, I've been taking alcohol shots to give me the impetus and CONFIDENCE to confront/challenge people (positively) and action complex agile 'moving parts' tasks quickly and efficiently.Without the fallback or reliance of these ""shots"", I have noticed I procrastinate, and I'm naturally a slow worker but deliver what senior leaders classify as outstanding work. So the alcohol shots allow me to do more (output), quicker and meet deadlines. I use it to function at work, period. I agree with the medical doctor that this has been used as a form of medication but made my anxiety worse over time.Tests were carried out, and it turns out I suffer from severe GAD (General Anxiety Disorder), having seen a range of GP's (Medical Doctors) and psychiatric doctors that day. They have prescribed low dose anxiety medication which takes up to several weeks to work, It's been four weeks, and I don't feel the benefits.Underpinning all this, I'm a very turbulent person mentally (although I appear timid and normal) on the surface - geek chic if you like. I lack confidence in my abilities and skills at work and evident in the majority of roles undertaken. I recall confidence being brought up in education capacities in the past. (o) REPETITIVE ISSUES: * Thinking and strategising excessively, but lacking output speed (I like detailed list managements and requirements gathering before starting work). I find it hard to work out of rhythm, especially where time is concerned, it's not in my natural nature to work at a fast pace, but the quality of my output is often praised and recognised, often detailed, insightful and meets deadlines. * Deteriorating Senior Leadership Relationships - Falling out of favour with senior figures of businesses in several months quickly, despite excellent work quality output often praised but always feel tension with authority, but improve with subordinates (same dept. or cross-department).* Miss Communication - Often interpreting what was said in meetings as actions to either add my own tweaks and not re-approaching superiors when unsure of project scopes, do not want to appear to need constant attention and commsAlways thinking, deep thoughts about simple things to significant decisions, constantly thinking of things to do and to add to my to-do-lists; these lists never seem to be done, just added too, few are ever actioned. I feel I procrastinate a lot, especially when starting new tasks personal/work; I want to know intrinsically about what I am doing, factors involved that can hinder progress and also the ""confidence"" to start the task. I have also observed with personal and work tasks; if I near completion, I leave it and move on to something new, knowing I have other priorities. (o) STRESS MANAGEMENT:Poor in general (panicked a lot, although not apparent to people overtly sometimes, but it does get mentioned), small things such as standing in a queue/line to be served in a shop and approaching the cashier can trigger anxiety. Stress at work in severe, requiring me to abuse substances to get through the day, and it helps motivate me sometimes to start and finish projects, helps me avoid procrastination. Perhaps I'm struggling due to added responsibilities and expectations; I easily get stressed and panicked in general.(o) FEARS / CHALLENGES & TENDENCIES All these recent work redundancy events have had a profound effect on my mental health and financial situation with home life, also putting a great deal of stress on my partner financially.Lack of ""Confidence"" in work skills & abilities, given the recent number of redundancies, although my direct involvement has resulted in uplift for the businesses proven through email praises periodically. THIS makes me believe there could be a problem in sustaining positive relationships, being open and providing clear communication to superiors. I have lost confidence in my personal life due to work but severely lack confidence now as a professional. I question my skills and abilities, even though I have pieces of evidence to contradict performance-related redundancy. I've started to get second opinions from my peers (pre, during or to review projects before submission). (These are peers I used to work together with historically and now gone on to thrive elsewhere in the same/similar role as me). Often even subcontracting work to my peers outside of my organisation, I doubt my skills and ability to deliver on time, when juggling multiple priorities.I must point out the part I enjoy in my job is the 'implementation'', specialist aspect; the ""doing"" part that gets results. I will be the first to admit I'm not the greatest communicator, but always ensure I advise, consult and inform my points and set out appropriate actions as straightforward as possible, providing I feel and express confidence.I tend to read situations differently to colleagues and often have been told by superiors I haven't understood or communicated to the end-user customer as originally directed, or frequently need points from meetings repeated via email/call.Being financially stable and secure while having job satisfaction are value pillars that form part of my core. My outlook has now become, It's no good having a first-class degree in a subject that I can practice and remain passionate about daily while receiving applause from company directors and senior leaders via emails sent to entire companies of which some are global household brands when I can't even keep the job.I'm struggling to keep up with aspects in my life due to a combination of factors; potential mental health disorders, severe OCD tendencies with note-taking, procrastination on the job, and having the confidence to start a task/job at hand (when I possess the technical ability and often get praised for the quality of work output, less so with speediness).I am also my own worst critic when things go wrong and live in constant fear of losing financial stability. I always need to remember to do things; my need to ""note take"" and create to-do-lists has got worse since childhood; the more stress, the more notes I make to do later. I don't want to miss any detail, big or small, where possible and don't think with a simple bullet point I can remember what to do.Note: Excessive note-taking started when I felt I lost my grandparents' support network and got worse over time due to anxiety.QUESTIONS:Q. If I'm achieving work objectives, why would businesses seek to fire/make me redundant? Previous 6 years have been made redundant once, recent last 5 years been made redundant 4 times.Q. Do you think being served a low dose of anti-anxiety medication will provide me with the same clarity and confidence that alcohol offers? So I can start, action and finish tasks as I'm accustomed too?Q. Do you think there is a possibility I am suffering from other mental health disorders? Such as Autism or on the spectrum with Aspergers Syndrome or ADHD? I don't believe the doctors are taking me seriously, but my counsellor/psychologist suspects Asperger's based on our sessions so far. All the symptoms cited on the NHS website for each of the above disorders and tendencies vehemently resonated with me and validated through my wife, close family and friends. Q. Any advice or guidance you could offer would be greatly received.Thank you."

anxiety,"Help! Anxiety is ruining my life  Hi Everyone,I have a massive mental health crisis in my life; I would sincerely appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to read and understand my problems and provide some advice or guidance. Its taken me 11 years to identify and recognise my issues.I'm also keen to hear from people who have had similar experiences. It would be greatly received. I'll jump right into my issues, but I will briefly cover a little about myself and my background first.(o) BIO: Age 33, Male, Married (5 years) and 7-month-old daughter.  (o) CORE VALUES:Structure, Regiment, Routine, Sometimes Spontaneous. Passions - include boxing, although not due to covid for almost a year. Travelling and enjoying a range of activities with my wife and daughter. (o) PERSONALITY:I am introverted by nature, not so much in social environments, but significantly timid in work environment constructs.(o) WORK ANXIETY ISSUES:Feeling on edge in work environments, I tend to avoid interaction with business leaders and superiors where possible (physically)—preferring to email instead of call. I've always had an issue with authority (in a work capacity) unless its a leader who is invested in empathy and listening. I often always seem to clash unintentionally with my superiors, as they are pretty direct. I understand there need for this, but it causes me severe anxiety - it's just, I'm passionate about my industry and job, but it's the interaction part in a work context I struggle with.I prefer to work in my specialist marketing role (technically minded). It just so happens I have broader marketing skills that benefit the team/business, but this causes me tremendous stress, enough to paralyse me into inaction when tasked to work outside my specialist role.Presently, I'm working in a matrix organisation with many senior leaders/directors with lots of priorities. I find it hard to distinguish priorities and not the best at communication; however, on several occasions, I seemed to have delighted multiple director/heads with outstanding work output, evident by email applause and appreciation. This has been a repetitive behaviour for the last 11 years, just worsened as I've got managerial responsibilities and direct stakeholder KPI accountabilities. (o) CURRENT SITUATION:Off work temporarily due to mental health issues, living off my savings for now. I had  2 mental breakdowns, 3 months into a 6-month probation (in this existing job post), on both occasions, resulting in hospital visits, and finally, a diagnosis of GAD made.Work stresses are manageable if my Anxiety is under control, which clearly has worsened; this has resulted in insufficient task attention and misplaced judgement, inability to clarify actions were required internally or externally of the organisation with client's I work for and prioritisation on recent tasks.To cope with work stress, I've been taking alcohol shots to give me the impetus and CONFIDENCE to confront/challenge people (positively) and action complex agile 'moving parts' tasks quickly and efficiently.Without the fallback or reliance of these ""shots"", I have noticed I procrastinate, and I'm naturally a slow worker but deliver what senior leaders classify as outstanding work. So the alcohol shots allow me to do more (output), quicker and meet deadlines. I use it to function at work, period. I agree with the medical doctor that this has been used as a form of medication but made my anxiety worse over time.Tests were carried out, and it turns out I suffer from severe GAD (General Anxiety Disorder), having seen a range of GP's (Medical Doctors) and psychiatric doctors that day. They have prescribed low dose anxiety medication which takes up to several weeks to work, It's been four weeks, and I don't feel the benefits.Underpinning all this, I'm a very turbulent person mentally (although I appear timid and normal) on the surface - geek chic if you like. I lack confidence in my abilities and skills at work and evident in the majority of roles undertaken. I recall confidence being brought up in education capacities in the past. (o) REPETITIVE ISSUES: * Thinking and strategising excessively, but lacking output speed (I like detailed list managements and requirements gathering before starting work). I find it hard to work out of rhythm, especially where time is concerned, it's not in my natural nature to work at a fast pace, but the quality of my output is often praised and recognised, often detailed, insightful and meets deadlines. * Deteriorating Senior Leadership Relationships - Falling out of favour with senior figures of businesses in several months quickly, despite excellent work quality output often praised but always feel tension with authority, but improve with subordinates (same dept. or cross-department).* Miss Communication - Often interpreting what was said in meetings as actions to either add my own tweaks and not re-approaching superiors when unsure of project scopes, do not want to appear to need constant attention and commsAlways thinking, deep thoughts about simple things to significant decisions, constantly thinking of things to do and to add to my to-do-lists; these lists never seem to be done, just added too, few are ever actioned. I feel I procrastinate a lot, especially when starting new tasks personal/work; I want to know intrinsically about what I am doing, factors involved that can hinder progress and also the ""confidence"" to start the task.

depression,"Wanna know the saddest thing about sh for me. Its running out of space on your usual spots. I was going pretty good for a while. I hadn't cut in months, i never felt like i had to even during breakdowns. But all of the sudden its so bad and i need to. Thats the part that makes me hate myself so much. Im so broken."
depression,Ok so short backstory:·im 16 in a week·last year on thanksgiving i was put in a mental hospital for 9 days (for thr first time)· this was very traumatizing and i spend most my time trying to forget it ever happened· i struggle with sh and am on medsOk so now that thats over with i can begin. So on thanksgiving i had an escape bc we had my sister and her family over. But the night before i couldnt help but cut. And ever since ive been in this horrible episode. I sleep 20 hrs a day. Barley have enough energy to eat let alone do anything else. I cant leave my room without coming back in tears. Ive been in this revolving door of breakdowns. I sleep try to socialize a little go back cry n cut. Feel bad sleep and so on and so forth. Its so exhausting.I feel like i cant escape. I cry everyday and im so exhausted. I just took my pills for the first timr in 4 days bc i just couldn't even try to get up. The only reason why i took them now is cuz i felt the withdraws. Its not pretty. But i just dont know what to do. I just cant stop. And idk how to live
depression,So for the past 1 or 2 days ive had this shooting pain in my right forearm. And ive been sh for about a year now. I looked it up and it says i have possible nerve damage. But i still have feeling and control on my arms wrist and fingers. So will i be fine. Is something wrong. Im scared and i cant tell my mom
depression,Im so done. I wanna fight and stay bc im only 15 and i actually believe i can help ppl. But my depression is too great. The times where i can cry are not so often any more since i started this new med combo. But the in between in almost worse. I feel hopeless and numb and overwhelmed all at the same time. I dont really know the best way to describe it. But all i wanna do rn is cry bc that will help a little. But i just dont have enough emotion in me to do so. And i just feel so hopeless. I tried to quit cutting but that failed quickly. I have no real vices. Everything and i mean everything is just a distraction from myself. And ik im always one failed distraction away from suicide. Im trying so hard but how much longer can i go on. This isnt going to get better. My life has always been one of trauma and pain. Ik nothing else. And i dont think i ever will.
depression,I lived with my abusing grandmother for 2 years with my fathers horrible family and there was a lot of fighting. I was 10-12 in that time. So they started fighting and at first it was fine but the louder they got the more it reminded me of my grandmother. I havent cried in weeks besides once 2 days ago when i accidentally hurt my mom and felt horrible. My meds make me feel numb so i dont cry much anymore. I was sitting there sobbing while trying to tell myself im ok.
depression,Ive only ever gone 2 weeks without cutting. And that was because my friends quince was in 2 weeks so i needed my scars  to heal. I have clinical depression and take meds. So when i started sh it was because i wanted to feel something other than the pain. But now my new meds make me feel numb. I dont feel sad but not happy either. Ive gotten to the point where ive run out of room on my arms. And have to cut on my thighs. Which i dont ever do bc i like wearing shorts. But i cant stop bc i need to feel something. Anything.
depression,Today i was helping with groceries and i threw a bag of baby clothes to my mom and she started crying and screaming in pain. There was a small candle that i didnt see. It hit her tooth and pushed it back. I felt to horrible. She was crying and now her lip is red and swollen. She went to the dentist and it cost 90 dollars. This is all my fault. I hurt everyone and ruin everything. I shouldnt be alive. My mom said she felt worse about how i felt. Bc i was crying while watching my nephews while they were at the dentist. It was actually the first time i cried in weeks. My new medication combo just makes me feel nothing. Not happy but not depressed. Idk. I cut so much today. I just had too. I needed sonething. I feel so bad she came to check on me a lot once she got back. Idk why im so stupid . even tho she told me she was ok and shes not mad and it was an accident. I cant help but think she should be mad. I deserve to die or to be hurt for this. I dont want to face my family but i will have to eventually.
depression,Ive been cutting for a year now. Ive had depression since the 7th grade. Institutionalized once and still want to die. Ive gone through so much trauma its horrifying but idk what do anymore. I went to therapy for a few months but my mom lost job and thus our insurance. My mom said that when she marries her finance she will have the insurance. But also says thats not until december.This is the same women that the first time i told her i want to die she sent me toa mental hospital. She met me with isolation not a its going to be ok. But i can never tell anyone anything anyway even if i want to. I just cant get the words out. I honestly want to stop but the depression will get worse and then how am i supposed to deal with it. But lately i want to cut even when im not in a mental breakdown. Idk if its an addiction but i hate myself so much. I constantly look in the mirror and think why am i so ugly why am i so fat. I hate my scars the fact i sh everything. But i have this feeling when im not sad that idk how to describe. Every word i try doesnt feel right.  But to stop this feeling i sh as well. I feel so guilty. I would starve myself if i didnt eat food to cope with depression.Sorry for the long rant. But idk i just dont know how im supposed to be a normal teenage girl when i cant go one week without suicidal thoughts or sh.
depression,"So im not good at telling people my feeling like at all. and maybe its bc no one has ever cared. or they dont act the way i need them too. to preface this, im 15 and have clinical depression. idk the first time i told my mom i wanted to die she just sent me to a mental hospital. i understand that she was angry bc she had caught me smoking weed. But she met me with isolation instead of comfort. so i often help my sister ( a single mom) with my nephews. But when i do it by myself it just gets too stressful and i end up breaking down. I finally told my mom this when she asked me to take them for an hour. But if i had someone to help me so im doing it all by myself and with no clue what im doing. But she just looked at me like she didnt believe me or she didnt care. in the end she had her fiance take care of them. But anytime i tell her something when im not breaking down she acts like its not real. like im  just making it up, or like she doesnt care. Shes done this a lot over the years. But she always tells me ""i wish you would just talk to me"". But when i mention something to her like this she acts like this. It happens when im breaking down too. I had a friend situation, in which she caught me crying. so i told her about it and she just became judgmental about it. im just so tired of no one caring like they should."
depression,"It occured to me while i was crying for hours today that no one will ave me. I  cried for hours begging to die and no one heard. No one came up to check on me , nothing. My family thinks that just because they cant see it , it means its not happening. Even tho almost all my family has depression. i mean FUCK the first time i ever told anyone i wanted to die my mom sent me to a mental hospital. Yet doesnt understand why i dont talk to her. She has raised 5 kids most of which have depression and she herself has it. yet she takes any chance she can to diminish my depression. while also claiming she knows exactly how my depression works. shell tell me its just hormones and we shouldnt increase my meds.  yet she also takes any chance to suggest things are because im depressed. she litterly told me to lie to the doctor ( or more so to say i was fine when i knew i wasnt) so they wouldnt incraese my meds. And it only just accured to me today that they dont care. they love me but they dont care enough to help. so i only have one choice left idk just yet how or when but it will be soon. Beacuse i cant continue like this its torture even more so than the emotional abuse i suffered as a child by my grandmother. its a never ending punishment for living. and ive had enough"
depression,Ive had depression for so long now and it just gets worse every day. But i sort of have this internal battle between my brain and my depression.On one hand my brain tells me that being skinny and not eating will make me happy. And that working out and being around ppl is good.But my depression tells me that i should eat instead of feeling. I should stop caring and not talk to anyone anymore. And i should just survive. I never can choose which one i want to listen too and its so hard. I hate this and my depression continues to get worse but my mom refuses to let me increase my meds bc its just hormones. As if wanting to kill myself is just hormones. I dont feel like life is even worth it anymore
depression,"So today they had gotten groceries. And he came in my room all pissed off saying i needed to help with groceries. I was tired because on my insomnia and i try to avoid sleeping so i dont have to think about everything i repress. But last night i didnt sleep, and fell asleep at like 8 am. The thing that makes me so fucking mad about this, is my brothers do it all the fucking time. Like they'll put up the non frozen stuff later bc their playing a game And he never has a problem with them. And i had told him i would do this. He continues to trash talk me to my brothers saying im an ""entitled, lazy, queen."" Like my bad that i have to sleep in order to not kill my self cut or fucking cry atm. So after that i couldnt stop crying and ive only just stopped like 2 hrs ago. And ive cut so much. More than i ever have all at once. Granted i have been having breakdowns and cutting for the past 2 days. But not this much and not this deep either. And ik he its the cause but hes the trigger. Because it would have happened at a later date. And not all at once. Because i usually cry then cut and distract myself. So if he hadnt been a dick for no damn reason it wouldnt be this bad. I cried for hours on end. I tried eating and it made me feel sorta better. That is until i made myself throw it up. Bc i had ate three burgers today. And i didnt want that to affect me. But i also havent eaten since breakfast yesterday. Because i slept all day yesterday. And i didnt eat breakfast today. And fell asleep for lunch. And i had the 3 burgers for dinner. And then threw them up so.And this has happened before. That arguments/ confrontation like this trigger a cutting spree. It happened last year with my brother. We had a small fight and once i got to my room i cried and cut.I just feel so hopeless. I thought medication was supposed to fucking help. But i was fine up until like last week. Then i started to feel an episode coming on. And i fucking hate it. I dont understand my i have to live. Like seriously. Whats the fucking point. All this pain and suffering all for nothing.I just want this all the stop. I want it to end."
depression,"So to start off im a 15 year old girl diagnosed with major depressive disorder (clinical depression) and im now in lockdown due to corona.I can feel when it will start getting worse. For me its like im going on a series of hills. It gets a little better and a lot worse. And i had made the decision i want my life to be as normal as it can be given my depression and all my circumstances. So i decided i didnt want to cut anymore. And for 3 weeks i did it, but granted that was just because i didnt feel the need to. But tonight i cut again only a little but i did and i just dont know how ima get through this.Because in my experience isolation feeds my depression. Which is why i use school and people to avoid all the things that i wanna avoid. And since both my brothers are on self quarantine i cant interact with them either. And all this lack of social interaction just isnt helping me.And to make matters worse im just stressing over unimportant things such as a guy or texts from friends. And all of it is just adding on to this whole thing which wont end well. Idk i just feel so trapped. Like im never going to get out of this. Im never going to be happy. Im never going to be in a relationship. Im never going to be normal."
depression,Ive had depression for few years now. Im 15 and a month ago my mom sent me to a mental institution. She had found me smoking weed and cutting. I got started on antidepressants. And they help for the most part. But everytime i get sad even a little i cry for hours then cut. And its hard bc i need to either get high or cut to get by. But if i get high my mom might call the cops on me. If i cut she goes fucking insane with lectures and talks etc. So i had gotten into a mini fight with my brother. And i had felt like i wanted to cry before then. But after i got done with being pissed i cried and cut. I already have many cuts on my arm from earlier this week/last week. And im worried i might get caught. I hate myself for doing this Every time i get sad but still. I wont tell anyone ever again. I just hate how ik this is why i could never be in a relationship or why no one will like/love me.
depression,So a little backstoryIm 15 and a couple weeks ago my mom made me go to the hospital to get a phyc eval after she found me smoking weed twice in one week due to my suicidal thoughts. The hospital after talking with me sent me to a mental institution where i stayed for 9 days. They put me on 50 Zoloft. And in the institution the made us go to bed at 9 so that's why i figured i was tired earlier at first. And now its to the point where during school im falling asleep all while barley being able to stay awake at home long enough to eat dinner. Which is like 3 hours after i get home ( for context ). And idk why tho.It could be the meds or just the depression itself but idk which one. Bc i still feel depression to a good degree but its just different now. Its really hard to explain how it makes me feel. So idk if i would need an increase or what in my meds. Because if my meds are already making me this tired then what would an increase do?
depression,"My father died 9 years ago (when i was 5). Today is fathers day. I always get sad around these times, but this time its different. My mom started dating again after stopping like 4 years ago. Im happy for her,the guy shes dating makes her happy. But at the same time hes not my dad. My dad was a good man who had a job that made him have all sorts of pain all just so his family could live a nice life. And now my mom is acting like where celebrating fathers day for him(like where celebrating him or something) and they've only been dating for like 3-4 months. Mabey less. Idk i like the guy but my mom hasent even brought up my dad once. Not visting his grave or just talking about him. And lately i just sit in my room and cry for hours because i look at the photo of my dad and i thats his face but i dont recognize it . i feel terrible for it ."
depression,I tend to bottle up my feelings which causes my emotions to burst out in deppression episodes that last until i deal with it by crying my eyes out for awhile. I have been doing good and haven't had one in like half a year or something like that. But i have been under a lot of stress and other things that are sorta complicated and i just get so sad and i stops me from doing things like going to dances at my school or hanging out with my friends. Then once i cry it out i feel numb for a good while. I just.... Idk .... dont know whats wrong with me. Like why cant i just be happy and stay that way.Sorry if this is deppressing
depression,"Im a 14 year old with a lot more stress than any 14 i know. The reason is that im trying to change the school system and its really difficult hence stress. Ever since i was 10 (when i was sent to live with my racist homophobic narsistic grandmother) i have bottled up my emotions because i would have to with her. All the time she would say my mom is trash my older brother is gay and thats bad (im youngest of 5) and my older sisters are terrible. But she never said anything bad about my second oldest brother because he looked most like my dad (my dad died when i was 5) so in order to cope i would bottle up my feelings and they would explode at the littlest things. I still do this ,and now every couple weeks or so it just gets so bad i will sit in my room and cry for hours .i could show up to school all sad for days. My doesnt know i feel this way even though i have tried to tell her i sorta think she dismisses it. I really dont do the whole extra sleeping thing. When i get into these ruts i tend to not talk to people and just stay in my room and whatch netflox instead of dealing with my issues. Im also really awkward and ive sort of found out that my stress and anxiety help me into these ruts. So do you think i have depression it does run in my family but idk."
depression,"My tics hit on and off and sorta in waves. I recently found that weed helps me quite a bit but when the tics don't hit or when I'm feeling the urge but the movements don't hit, it's hard not to feel like they are fake. When they hit I am in alot of pain and exhausted all the time. I don't know if anyone else has felt this way but this is hard to handle for me. It's feels invalidating"
depression,I work alot of hours about 60 plus and barely have time to myself or school. He usually comes over one day a week and he is a little bit picker on cleanliness. I vaccumn and wipe things down but I have clutter. Things I keep out to remind myself I need to take them or do something with them. Today he reminded me that he appreciates my efforts but they could be better. I think it's okay to have someone remind you every once in a while that you need to do better. It's feels terrible at first and I know it's mostly my ADHD and lack of time and organizational skills that are making my house suffer but it's a needed wake up call once in a while.
depression,"I started on Lexapro in 2019 and four days into the pill I started having tics. At first they were small gestures, by day three I was full fledge punching walls. I got hospitalized and they diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. * I have had those since I was a kid but never seeked out a diagnosis for those two specifically due to it being paired with my ADHD (diagnosed) *People with either TS or Conversion disorder how do you process this? I don't know what to think..One of the biggest side effects of Lexapro is involuntary muscle movements. Stress does tend to make the tics more severe but doesn't trigger them. I don't usually get any heads up on when they hit and the tics have morphed and changed. I don't know how to explain to the doctor that the stress and anxiety they are saying is causing the tics has been far worse in the past and I have never had tics until Lexapro."
depression,My tics were going bonkers and I had already taken my muscle relaxers. I told my boss at the gas station that they were bad and I needed something stronger. Beer helps me alot and help my brain chill especially when I don't have my CBD. He told me to take a 5 minute break and grab some beer. He let me drink it throughout my shift whenever my tics would flair. This is a major win for me. That's all
depression,"My tics started almost two years ago. They came after I was taking Lexapro and when I emailed the doctors emergency chat, they said it could be from the medication. At the time I didn't know what tics were. They got worse to the point of me hitting myself and when I got to the ER, they immediately took me in and gave me IV benadryl and Percocet. I don't remember the next three days. I apparently freaked out and they had to sedate me with ketamine and the follow days were followed with Ativan. I followed up with a neurologist who said the MRI and CAT scan didn't show anything and it was conversion disorder. That it was stress and anxiety. While I do have anxiety and ADHD, we didn't believe her on the cause.My tics come and go and they come in heavy waves to the point where I am on muscle relaxers for days and at the max dose. The tics started the other week and got to the point where nothing I was doing was working to get them to stop. I emailed my doctor because the bottle of Ativan (I use for emergencies) ran out. I have had that bottle since the ER. She replied and asked if I had gone to physical therapy. I am pissed because she will not acknowledge that therapy hadn't made these go away (I have had consistent sessions)  and that I'm slowly becoming immune to the baclofen. I had to go to the ER ticking and thrashing to get them to listen to me to give me the Ativan which ended up working and they gave me a bottle to take with me. I was having and emergency tic episode that I could not control and my doctor suggested therapy when I could barely drive. TL;DR Had bad episode to the point of meds not working, instead of better meds, doctor suggest therapy"
depression,I know this is due to some sensory things with my adhd but I feel like crawling out of my skin when ladies tshirts cut too close to the armpit or when clothes actually fit my figure. It feels off and its like a mental block. I don't feel comfortable in most women's shirt because they just feel too tight.
depression,"I decided to get my second degree but in coding. I remember why I hate school. When you think that 1+1=2 but your teacher got the same answer but a different way and then tells you that it is wrong, it is a very big slap in the face that you still learn different. That you still must conform. I can't be the only one, but when my answer is close to the professors and I still get a 0, it just confused me and irritates me and makes me think I misread the entire assignment. This is why English is so frustrating. I just want the sky to be blue, I don't want to have to add all the extra fluff if there is no reasoning behind it. I don't know. I'm very frustrated with school again."
depression,"I gained a tic disorder two years ago and for the first time I had to run a register. It was hell. People stared, they didn't hand me money but tossed it, and they avoided talking to me. I can't control it and the CBD and muscle relaxers only do so much to minimize it. Its very defeating to be treated like a freak. I used to have stronger meds and I am in therapy but it's very very defeating when people avoid me.This is very new to me. We don't know what triggered it or what keeps causing it. Its hard to deal with..I can't imagine how folks who have had thier whole life feel"
depression,"My wanting to people please people who I have a respect for and my brains inability to turn off pattern recognition makes social aspects and situations increasingly difficult and frustrating. This self sabotaging ruins alot of relationships and I need someone to say ""everything is ok"" for my brain to turn off. I don't find fidgeting or hiding other parts as bothersome but to know I'm behind my peers in social situations is hard and exhausting"
depression,I went to pick up a prescription for Adderall the other day and I left the pharmacy feeling like a criminal. The way people handle this is irritating and it frustrating because it does feel invalidating. I have tons on my plate and have become completely overwhelmed in my life. I havent medicated in over 15 years. I learned to cope but when life got rough I had to ask for help as compensating for all the little quirks and social mess ups became too much to handle on top of everything. My mom sounded very disappointed and it was like pulling teeth to get the pharmacist to just let me pay for it. They didn't even go over side effects or how long they would last. The world needs to understand that not everyone is a criminal and not everyone shows ADHD outwards.
depression,I'm one of those people that will go from watching a movie to playing a game to listening to music and then up sleeping. My poor phone is on the receiving end of things and I end up taking up a ton of space by the end of the trip. I do wish I could multi task better on a plane. I usually end up playing games with a movie in the background at home but you can't do that on a plane.
depression,"I moved out on my own and it has been hell. I'm in a new city, no friends, no family, new store and new boss. It's been hell on my days off. But today I got a cat and things are looking up again. He makes the apartment lively and I don't feel so alone."
depression,"I may finally have energy again but now my moods are swinging and now I have energy to get irritated at minor inconveniences. I really can't decide if I like it or not. I can't help but feel emotions again, but also things that used to not irritate me now do and I have the expectations of perfection again. Im torn"
depression,Started taking Lexapro for General Anxiety and Depression and I am not feeling well. My depression is way worse and my moods are constantly changing. Has anyone else experienced this and will it go away? I also have ADHD and I don't know if that is interfering.
depression,"My folks have never understood why I wear so many sweatshirts and why the ""self help"" books have been a  detriment, but at the same time, I can't bring myself to do anything other than to just tell myself to toughen up like I was taught. Sure I get out my comfort zone sometimes and then I immediately get back in it. I'm good in extremely unpredictable and stressful situations, but the minute I even want to relax it all goes away. I am constantly trying to work so I don't have to be at the house or relax. I'm just frustrated at this point with everything and I'm probably just overthinking. Sorry for the vent."
depression,"Im an upbeat person, i laugh i play anything that makes me happy does, i mean my 13'th birthday is comming up. So, thats me, on good days, now bad days are about 25% bad the rest is neutral and happy.here let me give you some backstory, I was never supposed to be born, my mom was 18, i had to live with my grandparents most of the time, they where my closest family, the grandma and grandpa that saved the day. anyway i moved to puerto rico for two years, and well when i was 5 i watched my dog get run over, i remember it vividly. her cries and yelping, the car sounding like a speed bump, the dog rolling over like it did a trick, espaecialy the amount of blood coming out, it was one of the first horrible things that happened to me. Then about 2-3 years later, I was 8 and i went to visit who were honestly my favorite family members, my grandma and granpa, the two that raised me, i saw they were not ther and i knew, i kept telling my mom, they died didnt they? but she didnt think so. i was right. i think it was summer but i dont fully remember. after that i was diagnosed with clinical depression at 8, major guilt and self esteem problems. One day I was at recess in 2nd grade and i accidentally hurt a kid with a hoolahoop, i cried for an hour and tried to choke on a grape and with my hands. yata yata yata i had a few minor problems here and there, and i forgot to mention i grew up without a dad, i thought that was the norm almost my whole life so i was unfazed by that, but the only male role model in my family died when i was 8 so its not so bad but i learned sitting with my legs crosed, dont know if thats bad or not but anyway I'll get to the point now.i have tons of 'triggers' like classic rock, my favorite genre makes my tear up every time i here it, same with country music (texan here), especialy the words trauma and hard times really get the best of me, which is hard when you have a whole hevaly greaded assignment based on that. then when i am not doing anithing or on autopilot i will start thinking on ways to you know. which is why i am normaly doing something, and why i never go to sleep unless i know i will fall asleep in 5 minutes. you dont understand how reckless i am, if no one is watching ill sit on rooftops hoping to fall, hold knives by the point trying to get cut and the most common thing that i cant even explain is that i wake up with mysterious cuts on me, mainly my face and upper arms, i dont even remember getting those. and when i ask for help i get a lecture about what will happen without me which just makes me more sad and leaves me feeling worse than i already did. then when i think about asking for help i feel no one will take me seriously, which makes me think on how to harm myself so people will understand this is not a joke and i need help, but i feel like im just a kid looking for attention.what im trying to say is: is this real, or am i making this up, like a kid looking for attention. I genuinly am happy but got alot of stuff in my past, the deppression i hear is never happy and always sad and now im questioning if im just making this up.WTL;DR: 12yo (who has been through some stuff) wanting to know if his ""depression"" is actualy serious."
depression,"Dont say just be happy, think of it as something you can understand. ex: Depression is like a hole with a slipery edge, dont push him. Many people just say be happy, but in reality its like a really deep whole with slipery edges and people saying ""Just climb up"" Istead hand him a rope, be a support.I am was also in this phase, exactly what you described is me in my experience, what got me out is what I would lose, for me it was a newborn baby sister. now 4 years later I have seen the rise of new technology (VR) and got to experience it, I would have never if I went through with it in 2nd grade.Also, I had been depressed for 2 years, then it went away, Now I have it worse than ever. Remember it comes back, for me it took a year and a half to come back. Also do the things he likes, a good therapy is a good hobby. And if he is discouraged you can do what my school counselor did and make a 5-sense-box. Its a box that has something that feels pleasant (playdough or something) something that tastes pleasant (candy or gum) something that looks pleasant (montoge or intresting video) and finaly something that sounds pleasant (music or calming audio)tl;dr distract him from sadness with fun, if he is sad do a good calming exercise (sometimes just being there helps),  don't expect him to get oud on his own, he needs help."
depression,"I was in class (online) and the counselor was talking, about really sensitive stuff. Not to me, but sensitive subjects. I managed to hold it in but I couldnt, I had to tell the teacher but I hated it, I messaged her and as soon as I pressed enter I regreted It but luckly she let me leave the zoom. As soon as I left I broke into tears. My body just started taking the biggest and fastest breaths that I have ever done. I know I need to go to class but i still am not over it. I dont have acces to much as I am 13 but I really want help because I need to get to class"
depression,"Please don't dismiss me, I know I'm young <13 but I'm not someone who just said i have it because they are sad, I was diagnosed with depression at 7, it lasted 2 years but I got over it, but at school I had an assignment to wright about hard times, I was lucky school was online because I almost broke down. Now I'm slipping down the hole, I recently went the lowest I have ever gone. I started to actually plan... You know. My mom helped me but same thing happened again at school, I was frozen for the rest of class. Now I have the feeling, all the negative emotions jumbled up into one. How do you deal with this feeling?"
depression,"Right now I'm taking antidepressants, is Escitalopram 10 mg, some months ago I feel really sad and have episodes went I don't know is I was in the reality” the term is desrealization I think. That thing doesn't happens to me anymore, but 2 weeks before until this day I feel completely sad and useless. Someone has experience with this pills?"
depression,"I already post about my condition, I'm taking 10 mg of Escitalopram, 2 mg of Rivotril and 10 mg of Zolpidem. My doctor give me my diagnosis just one month ago and I was really happy that I know what I have.I already have suicidal thoughts, but never do anything because the death scared me, but the more I think about that the more I feel stress and sad. Right now I'm in a healthy relationship, finished my studies and everything is fine. But I'm really scared is I do something in future, is something bad happen I'm scared of maybe think of killing myself. That thought grow every day and I don't know how to stop it."
depression,"Hi! Just two weeks ago I was diagnosed with dysthymia, I have sleeping problems since I have 10 years olds (now I have 22). I have episodes of anxiety because of the pandemic, and desrealization momentos (I though I was going crazy) but I started going with a psychiatrist almost a year ago, in the beginning she started to treat the insomnia, but with the time and the things I tell her, now he diagnosed me with dysthymia. Right now, I'm taking 2 mg of Clonazepam, 10 mg of Escitalopram and 10 mg of Zolpidem. All this things control the insomnia and make me feel great, but sometimes I have that episodes of a lot of sadness. Should i have increased dosis? With this I have to feel happy and never sad? Idk what to think and I don't have enough information of this."
depression,"I was diagnosed with ADHD six months ago and currently take a drug called Adderall XR (I think that means it's extended release).The med is fantastic when I'm working. However, I do feel myself feeling a bit highly strung at night, once the day's over, and in need of something to settle me down in order to just chill out / get out of that productivity zone and to sleep.Does this necessarily mean that my dose is too high? Or could it just be a facet of ADHD that I have to learn how to deal with?Basically the medicine is fantastic during the day but at night time I end up feeling kind of stressed out and like I need something to ""undo"" all that stimulation so that I can wind down and have sociable chats with loved ones and finally get to sleep. If I don't eat it's mental anxiety. But if I do it's like this kind of physical tension (jaw clenching etc) that I just can't get rid of naturally. I'm sure others here know the feeling I'm talking about!"
depression,"I'd be interested to hear what ""augmentation strategies"" those in the group have found helpful with their anxiety. In case that's not understood: drugs that you add on to an SSRI/SNRI in case you're not getting a good enough response to them.I know that BuSpar is popular for this purpose alongside TCAs and other drugs.If you've gone down this route, what combination did you find ultimately helpful?"
none,
depression,I have longstanding GERD that got a lot worse about a year ago after a stomach surgery.I've been self medicating ADHD with coffee for quite some time which is clearly terrible for stomach acid.I tried Concerta a while ago and it caused depression. My ADHD doc said that I needed to see a psychiatrist before re attempting testament which I have now done (and am on Zoloft).I've just been prescribed Vyvanse which I'm hoping will take the place of caffeine but am wondering if it will provoke reflux like coffee.Are there any meds that don't have this side effect?
depression,"I've recently added sulpiride (50mg) on top of Zoloft (50mg).I'm taking the latter for anxiety/depression. The sulpiride is being added for stomach stuff in the dyspepsia realm.Unless it's my imagination (and I'm getting a bit better at trusting myself that it isn't), the sulpiride has made me quite a bit drowsy.I took it for a few months before starting the Zoloft and definitely remember feeling a little bit less sharp when driving.Obviously it's a very small dose (I believe the smallest) and significantly lower than the dosage for most psych indications. But I thought I would see whether anybody here had experience with it. And if so what kind of manifestations they noticed.TY"
depression,"Hi folks,I recently started an SSRI for anxiety / depression. I've been laying off the alcohol as a result. But looking back at what would put me at my lowest, I think I've isolated the combination: alcohol (specifically) after caffeine. (For ages this was my self medication seesaw). I was initially diagnosed with ADHD and thought the depression I got at the end of the day might have been a side effect of the stimulant I was taking. But actually because I was also taking caffeine (and having a drink at the end of the day) I'm pretty sure that the coffee then alcohol combo was the culprit.Usually drinking alcohol is (acutely) enjoyable. But if I drunk it while I still had a caffeine buzz it was like the usual sedative effect of alcohol was multiplied ten fold and I could go from being super productive to extremely depressed in like 30 minutes flat - or sometimes just 10.As I said I'm giving alcohol a skip for the moment so that the SSRI can work. But I'm curious if anybody else experienced this reaction and what the reason might be?"
depression,"I have depression and anxiety as well as trouble concentrating. According to my psych, the latter may be caused by ADHD or it may all derive from the first. I tried Concerta at first but it ended up making me depressed. So I've been told to try an SSRI and then we might give a stimulant a second chance.I'm a month into Zoloft and it's hard to tell whether it's helping much with the concentration problems. Obviously it's not helping 100% with that as if it were I guess I wouldn't be here asking the question. But I do feel like calming down the anxiety has gotten rid of the sense of restlessness which in turn makes it much easier to sit still and read a book for a few hours.However, I still have like 50 tabs open in Chrome and, when I'm trying to get work done, I keep breaking my focus to go pursue some distraction. This is exactly the kind of thing I want to cut out but my mind moves in so many directions.Anybody find Zoloft or another SSRI useful for treating these kind of issues focus and concentration issues?I've been very pleased with the response in terms of my overall mental health and feel like I'm coming back from a pretty depressed place. But it's a little harder to judge how effective is it for the focus and concentration problems I've been experiencing for a long time."
depression,"I'm now on day 26 of Zoloft and at 50mg. I'm a 33 year old guy taking the drug for mixed depression and anxiety.Having never taken an SSRI before I wasn't too sure what to expect. The only thing I knew about serotonin before taking this was that MDMA increases it (which I've never taken!). So I thought that if it ""worked"" it was going to produce a kind of elated effect.Instead the feeling I have is that I'm very slowly coming out of a deep hole (or like a fog is slowly lifting). It's definitely a day by day thing. Each day feels about 0.1% better than the last. In other words, the change is barely perceptible. And I wish the process would speed itself up. But I can still feel progress. Sometimes day to day. But certainly week to week.Ironically (what I believe to be) the feeling of slowly emerging from depression has made me a little bit depressed. I'm depressed that I didn't take better care of my mental health a lot sooner and bitter about the impact that this has had upon my confidence and career ambition (I could be doing a lot better than I am now and weirdly enough my business is now at a bad point and I'm not really motivated to do anything about it because it's become clear that I want to do something else entirely!).I also have this weird objectivity about the problems in my life (which center around my consulting business and how difficult it has been to make a living doing that). As in my depression is largely situational but getting treatment has actually made that a lot more obvious. I can appreciate from some sort of distance how sucky the last few years of my life has been and a few times have thought ""that would make anybody down!"". The difference is that I'm giving myself a bit more empathy in terms of understanding why it made me feel so bad.I'm also ruminating a bit to the time from before I was depressed (which, being honest, is like 10 years in the past!). I'm remembering old friends very fondly. And I'm bummed out that being depressed made me so much less social. Although these regrets are painful, they're accompanied by a positive desire to start afresh and begin mixing and mingling again as soon as that's possible. I seems to have taken the emerging process for me to realize how much having an unfulfilling social life the past few years has pained me.On the positive side my inner dialogue seems to have automatically shifted. The only way I can describe it is seeing the glass hall full rather than half empty but without any conscious effort on my part. To give a simple example: if my room is messy but the bed looks inviting I'll think ""what a nicely made bed."" A few weeks ago I would have just thought ""my room is in a state!"" It's actually weird adjusting to this new dialogue.I'm also slightly bummed out about the sexual side effects and the fact that I'm feeling a bit too numb (although it's better than anxiety/depression). I got little waves of euphoria during week one (I've heard this is common) but then they sort of petered out.And I have this weird thing whereby I feel tired but have a hard time staying asleep. So it's hard to know what it's doing to my energy levels. But given that I only slept 5 hours last night and am fairly alert I suspect it might be slowly increasing them.TL;DR: I thought the feeling of coming out of depression would feel euphoric. Instead (if that's what I'm feeling) it just feels like a veil or fog is very slowly shifting and my internal dialogue is better. What's surprised me most is how slowly and subtly this drug works."
depression,Do doctors ever prescribe temporary dosage increases of an SSRI say during an extra stressful period - even as short as a day / week?
depression,Is it generally the case with SSRIs that the quicker you titrate up your starting dose and the higher your starting dosage the quicker you'll get your symptoms under control?Does a more aggressive loading phase yield a quicker clinical response?
depression,"I was recently diagnosed with depression (dysthymia) and anxiety. I have energy and focus issues too that might be ADHD or might all stem from the depression/anxiety. My psych says we'll figure that out by trialing drugs. My journey towards addressing my mental health problems began about a year ago by seeing a therapist. I found that helpful in terms of helping make sense of the various issues I have going on but it did nothing to alleviate the physical difficulty I feel in getting motivated enough to work (and remain focused) without self medicating with caffeine (and alcohol some nights to suppress the stimulation before bed). Which in turn obviously create more anxiety including through the direct effects of the drug. Eventually after realising that this self medication approach was totally untenable I caved and saw a psychiatrist who prescribed an SSRI. A stimulant medication might be added if the SSRI isn't enough to replace the job that caffeine was doing for my focus and energy. Which would probably mean that I truly have ADHD. Like many people with mental health issues, I tend to buy into black or white thinking and love the idea of landing on some elusive cure for my conditions. Now that I've finally started medication there's a voice in my head (not literally) asking what's the point of putting myself under financial pressure (a big part of my problems) seeing a therapist when I could just get and stay well by taking a daily pill? On the other hand, if therapy is really going to eventually get me better, why do I need to suffer through the side effects of medication and become dependent on them? (Note: I'm currently doing both; and the idea of having to experience withdrawals was the singular reason why I resisted SSRIs for so many years.) Shouldn't I just tough it out for a little longer and wait for it to 'work' by hammering out my cognitive distortions and resolving my trauma? If not why not cut my losses and go with the drugs? Otherwise asked:If my depression is biological, why should talking ever be expected to help? If, on the other hand, it's rooted in thought, why should chemicals ever be the solution? In what situations would both approaches therefore be warranted? Basically I'm having (severe) trouble reconciling myself to the fact that both forms of treatment may play separate valuable roles and would rather side with either psychiatry or psychotherapy to try resolve my problems. In my dogmatic way of thinking, I'd prefer to either go all in on therapy or commit to taking pills indefinitely. But I have a hard time coming to terms with the idea that both may be required and neither will be a total fix. For whatever reason that duality makes me confused and uncomfortable. TIA for any advice!"
depression,"I was a straight A student for most of high school and studied a very traditional degree in college which was intended to prepare me for a very classical profession.During this period, I disappointed my family by pursuing a profession that I was much more passionate about (connected with marketing) but which — I never considered at the time — was far less lucrative. I finished my degree but never used it and transitioned into this marketing-related field.I know that I am good at what I do (as a consultant, most of my clients are repeat customers who come to me by referral), but, faced with a very high cost of living, I only make enough money to survive month to month and, as a consequence, have a lot of financial stress.Before deciding to consult, I worked at a really horrible startup that tried to give me a major promotion but then claimed they were too poor to pay a raise. Two years later, they're still in business.A few ""friends"" who work in sales recently divulged how much they're earning. To my surprise (they're relatively junior) it's more than six figures. And they don't even think that that's a lot. They have absolutely no idea what kind of experiences I have been through here trying to sell myself — whether as a consultant or employee — to companies just like theirs. Who seem absolutely miserly. Where I'm based it seems typical that sales teams are paid like rockstars and marketers .. like crap.Evidently what I do (sorry to be vague) is thought of as a low level and poorly remunerated profession where I live. It's so disheartening to see friends with far less experience making more than 3 times my salary doing something that I think sometimes has little intrinsic value (not talking about sales in general but rather their companies ... unimpressive).I know I shouldn't take it personally, but, as a guy, working in a low paying field makes me feel like a total failure. I like my friends working in sales but feel like cutting them off only because I'm embarrassed about how little I earn in comparison to them. They live such different lifestyles to me and can't even imagine how difficult doing what I do for a career it or how much I have to budget and worry about money.  I know that I deserve to be better paid and my friends like to tell me that they'd hire me in a heartbeat because I'm ""so talented"". But nobody with a cheque book is prepared to pay me more than a nominal amount or treat me any better than a task rabbit. It sucks and makes me angry and frustrated."
depression,"Recently diagnosed with mixed depression and anxiety. Possibly also ADHD. Or all focus issues could be attributable to the depression.For years I self medicated with coffee which solved my low energy and focus issues for the most part but had a high price in terms of causing / exacerbating anxiety and screwing up sleep.The problem is that my fatigue issues have actually gotten worse since starting Zoloft a few weeks ago (to the point that staying awake for an entire day is hard!).   My goal, in getting treatment, is to replace self medication with proper drugs so I'm trying to get off the caffeine. Is there anything that specifically helps with the fatigue aspects of depression that could replace the caffeine if required? Maybe Concerta or  another stimulant? I'm hoping things will get better with the SSRI (including fatigue and focus) but if they don't, I'll need to add something to the regimen."
depression,"My CPTSD, I believe, arises from growing up in a dysfunctional home with an alcoholic father and a mother who used ""tough love"" to keep my siblings and I safe and in line.Something which sparked the interest of my therapist today was the fact that at a certain point in time (after my father died of his alcoholism) I developed a very rigid belief that relaxation is harmful and must be minimized.This has manifested itself in a few ways.For one, I began using coffee (obsessively) to constantly drug myself into a state of near 24/7 hypervigilance which I only let down one night a week when I drunk alcohol and socialized with friends (and even then I remember never letting myself get beyond feeling tipsy; if I did I would often drink coffee to undo the chemical relaxation the alcohol created!).At a certain point (again after the trauma had passed through the death of my father) I also dropped all the normal hobbies I had like playing sports and video games. In their place —fuelled by the obsessive coffee consumption —  I used every spare minute of every day to do something productive. Productivity became my mantra. And it's about at this point that I began developing problems with anxiety and depression.I've maintained this set of behaviors to this day which has had weird effects on my personality (like the fact that I no longer know anything about sports or pop culture). I don't allow myself to watch fiction TV for example - because I think it's a waste of time - so I watch documentaries instead. I drink coffee throughout the day to keep ultra alert. And rely subconsciously upon my anxiety as a defense mechanism. After today's therapy session I realized that the cumulative objective of all these behaviors is to make myself as ready as possible to face danger ... except that the danger has passed and these behaviors are no longer serving my interests (the opposite in fact).When I think back to the period of my trauma — lying in bed terrified waiting for my father to come home after one of his binges quite possibly in a highly volatile and irascible state — all this makes total sense.As a defenseless and terrified child it wasn't enough to be normally vigilant to be safe. Relaxing in my home wasn't an option when at any moment the peace and quite of normally family life could be ruptured by the unannounced arrival of an unstable alcoholic.Instead, I had to be hypervigilant just to feel safe— literally listening out for the turning of the door in the small hours of the night which was my cue to pretend I was asleep to avoid his presence. I've brought that same faulty behavior with me through to adulthood. Only the tools I have at my disposal have changed: I now have access to coffee to stay alert and I set myself rules to avoid relaxing. Sorry for the long post! Understanding why I've developed this belief seems to me like a good starting point to change it. And I think that I need to stop seeing hypervigilance and anxiety as a protective force in order to be free from its harmful influence. Then I can go back to watching TV and not drinking coffee like a crazy person."
depression,"I'm day 20 into my first SSRI (Zoloft, 50mg).One of the subtle differences I have noticed so far is that I seem to be able to recall old memories better.I had a somewhat difficult childhood growing up with an alcoholic father and a lot of domestic unrest (which I believe is at the root of my anxiety today). As a result my recollection from this period of my life is hazy. I can sense, in a way, that there are more memories than those which I occasionally think about, but also that they are too painful to currently deal with. So for the moment they remain trapped.But for whatever reason, this week I was able to remember things from that period that I haven't remembered or thought about in 10+ years. I was able to recall details of the PS2 games that I played as a kid (Gran Turismo 3, The Rugrats!) and a few other details. The memories just sort of came to me spontaneously also which was strange.I know this question might seem a little 'out there' but has anybody noticed a similar effect? I feel like my day to day short term memory / recall is a little bit more accurate too. Although on the downside I'm exhausted and have been having the sexual side effects."
depression,Just picked up my first caffeine pills yesterday from a sports supplement store. 100mg.This is my first time every trying them but I figured that it might be safer to take them rather than drink coffee with my SSRI because I'll know exactly how much caffeine I'm ingesting.Reason for buying them: a) ADHD (that might be secondary to anxiety/depression or could be comorbid. I won't be able to tell until I've given the SSRI a good shot). b) Extreme fatigue and brain fog due to starting Zoloft (but I also need to get work done).Has anybody taking these with an SSRI? Is there any data about what a safe intake would be?I've been trying to keep it to 200mg per day (because that's what I've heard the safe caffeine limit is) and am on Zoloft at 50mg. Haven't noticed any adverse reactions between the two and it's definitely helping take the edge of the exhaustion / brain fog and actually get something done with my days.
depression,Has anybody taken sulpiride (atypical antipsychotic) or amisulpiride with amitriptyline or nortriptyline?
depression,"For those whose anxiety didn't respond completely to an SSRI / SNRI, what add-on medications / augmentation approaches did you try to achieve a better response?Some drugs that I've heard about being added to an SSRI for anxiety disorders:* Buspar / buspirone* Atypical antipsychotics* Antihistamines like hydroxyzine* Pregalbin (an anticonvulsant; used off-label for anxiety)* Wellbutrin (buproprion)"
depression,I've been prescribed 50mg Zoloft for anxiety / depression.I'm also trying to sort out a stomach issue (postsurgical dyspepsia) which psychiatric drugs are also used to treat.The first drug my GI wants to try is nortyptiline but he mentioned that he would like to try buspirone (10mg 3 times daily) if that doesn't work out.Has anybody taken an SSRI and buspirone together? Can the combination be used?
depression,"Does anybody have really severe anxiety that requires multiple pharmaceutical medications to treat?If so, what combination of drugs are you on?"
depression,"Hi /r/dysthymia,I was diagnosed with GAD + PDD / dysthymia recently. I'm on day 14 of Zoloft (now 50mg).I feel like the anxiety and feeling of being on the verge of a panic attack is already starting to lift (subtle but perceptible changes).My mood, however, is still a little depressed. How long does it take for an SSRI to begin lifting PDD?"
depression,"I've seen two psychiatrists in the past two weeks.The first guy I saw actually seemed like a decent doctor but he told me that he wouldn't allow me to keep taking another psychiatrist drug that another specialist prescribed for a non-psychiatric disorder because it was a ""stupid diagnosis."" That was a deal-breaker for me because my issues which that drug was prescribed for are very hard to deal with and I need both meds.The second guy was much more reasonable. Fortunately he will be happy to work in the second drug if required.However both psychiatrists were kind of let-downs on an interpersonal basis. The first guy fixed me with this intense and hostile stare for the duration of our appointment and wouldn't engage in small talk. The second guy was super awkward and (for some unknown reason) wouldn't make eye contact and looked at the wall next to me when I was speaking. I really didn't real feel at ease with either.I don't mean to be judgy, but it would seem like an obvious prerequisite for me that those working with patients with mental health problems could have a friendly disposition. Most docs I have seen, including my family doc, are approachable and friendly. But both psychs I have seen stand out as unusually cold and unfriendly.Is there any rhyme or reason for this or have I just had bad luck so far? It seems a little strange to me that those specializing in providing mental health care would be unfriendly and hard to relate to."
depression,I mentioned to a friend that I've gone on an SSRI for anxiety / depression. I thought that she would be supportive as I know that she has been on these drugs herself (but hasn't managed to get fully off).I was surprised to hear that she recommended that I manage my condition with exercise and a good diet. Trust me I've tried all those things and more!I guess in her mind I keep up a pretty good front of seeming relatively content. Which is crazy to think.Being a good actor isn't good at all!
depression,"I bought a second monitor yesterday for my workstation.It's supposed to be the same as my other one. I even bought the same brand (Dell). But there's a slight difference in color between the two.I know that this is the kind of thing that would be ""no big deal"" to most people. I brought my GF in and she could barely even see the difference.But for me it's enormously distracting. I literally can't stop thinking about how different it looks every time I move something onto the second screen.I'm just starting on an SSRI (for GAD and depression, but I have so many hangups like this that I think are part of pure O OCD). But I really wish that I wasn't so distracted by tiny things like this. A slight difference in color between two screens will probably reduce my productivity by 30% unless I somehow acclimatize to the difference!"
depression,"I'm currently dealing with mixed anxiety, depression and possibly ADHD. Thinks got bad when I quit drinking alcohol (I was drinking a couple of beers a few times a week, so not huge volume but it was doing enough to significantly reduce my anxiety). My doc put me on Zoloft and also gave me a month's supply of Xanax. I asked him how often I could take them without risking addiction and he said taking them every day for a month would be fine and the SSRI should be helping by then.Has anybody else taken a benzo while coming on an SSRI? Were you able to get off that fine once the SSRI got your anxiety under control +"
depression,"Hi!I suffer from the common triad of anxiety, depression and (possibly) ADHD (psychiatrist isn't sure yet if the focus issues are all due to anxiety or if I also have ADHD). I'm now on day 9 of Zoloft. My mission has been to eliminate all forms of self medication (I was using coffee and alcohol for years for focus and relaxation). But without the crutch of alcohol my anxiety and panic are now in overdrive. My doc prescribed me a month supply of Xanax and told me to take it as needed. He said that by the time I'm through the SSRI should have mostly kicked in and I can just stop taking them. I've been using them at most twice a week because I'm terrified of the idea of getting physically addicted to benzos - even though my doc didn't seem worried and I even asked him about that.Has anybody used this strategy with success? I'm going to continue to play it cautiously but would like to know if others have been prescribed a benzo as a bridge while the SSRI begins to do its job"
depression,"Hi /r/CPTSD,I grew up in an alcoholic home and periodically think about horrible experiences that happened there (are they considered flashbacks if they're not automatic but just intrusive and periodic?). No physical violence thankfully but lots of parental crying, fighting, etc.Fast forward 10 years. My alcoholic father has been dead almost as long. But I'm now dealing with anxiety and depression.How do I know that there's a connection between my childhood trauma and what I'm experiencing now? And couldn't my present problems just be a result of present or more recent difficulties? TY!"
depression,"Hi /r/CPTSD,I'm in therapy for anxiety/depression. I grew up in an alcoholic home with a lot of shouting and general stress. My mom also became an overbearing depressed type which I have to deal with now (my late father, who was the alcoholic, passed away).I have a lot of very traumatic memories that I can visualize very easily. But I'm not sure how to actually go about doing anything about them.My therapist tried EDMR in one session but I really didn't like it. I'm surprised to see that it has science behind it but it kind of felt like suspicious to me.We haven't gotten to ""addressing"" the trauma using talk therapy yet, but it would be nice to know what kind of thing to expect and whether there's any likelihood it's going to make a difference. She uses a mixture of CBT, psychoanalysis, DBT, and ACT. In other words, a mish-mash of methods.Thank you!"
depression,"I know that some people experience mental health issues due to life circumstances. Others, I have read, have the genes for it but they need some stressful life experience(s) before the mental health problem can manifest.Is there another category of people that can lead a totally idyllic life but their genes just set them up for anxiety/depression and that's what they end up getting?"
depression,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and PDD (persistent depressive disorder) and possibly also ADHD (maybe its own problem or just a result of anxiety / depression issues). For me the anxiety component is heavily dominant. I reckon a good amount of my issues stem from the combination of a difficult childhood (alcoholic father) and a narcissistic controlling mother.I've just tried Zoloft for a week but really can't stand the side effects. It gave me total erectile dysfunction (clearly I'm a guy), made urinating feel weird, and I'm burning up from just walking a few minutes. The thought of getting brain zaps when it's time to taper off makes me very uncomfortable too.I asked my therapist today whether it's possible to treat anxiety / depression with therapy only or whether medication is always warranted. She said that in cases where people can't function (at all) medication can be life-saving. But I definitely don't feel at that point.Has anybody here successfully treated their anxiety through talk therapy only (or at least got things under control)? I know that therapy is a lot of work (and I put a lot of effort into it).I'm seeing a psychiatrist next week to see if a different med could be described so that option is very much still on the table. But I'm just wondering if there are people who manage to get things under control solely through therapy."

depression,Are there any recommended books that cover information specific to dysthymia?I know that self-help books have their limits but thought it might be a good way to get information about the condition.Or would books about depression in general likely be just as useful?
depression,"Saw a psychiatrist yesterday who diagnosed me with GAD and dysthymia. The latter makes total sense in retrospect as, for as long as I can remember, I've always had a somewhat bleak outlook on life, although I wonder how much of that is genetic and how much is attributable to C-PTSD and growing up in a difficult (alcoholic) home. Anyway, I'm now dealing with two differing opinions from psychiatrists as to what dosage of Zoloft I should take. The first I saw recommended 50mg. The second recommended 100mg.Would love to get a sense for what dosages you guys are taking to keep things on an even keel? I've been very hesitant to start SSRIs so my preference would be to keep things as low as possible. But would love to know what kind of treatment other sufferers are getting."
depression,"I've just been diagnosed with anxiety/depression.When relating my history to the psychiatrist I began to realize that I've probably had some aspects of both for just about as far back as my memory stretches.Unfortunately my family history is kind of murky. My father was an alcoholic who essentially drank himself to death (or rather died from complications of alcohol). I can only assume that there's something that drove him to drink.My mom is just about the most gloomy person I have ever met. She is constantly pessimistic. But she refuses to acknowledge that anything's wrong or seek mental health care. I have a pretty good feeling that my anxiety / depression stems from bad genetics. But unfortunately I have no real way to investigate whether this is the case given that I'm not in contact with the paternal side of the family and my mom refuses to discuss the issue.Anybody in a similar situation? It would be nice to be able to provide psychiatrists with a complete family history, but I'm not in a position to be able to provide one."
depression,I've been diagnosed with GAD and mild depression with likely secondary ADHD (my psychiatrist is hopeful that SSRI treatment will improve my focus but is reserving the option to treat the ADHD directly if that isn't successful). For me the anxiety is predominant.The first psychiatrist wanted to put me on Zoloft at 50mg. I got a second (private) opinion because I wanted somebody to give me a longer evaluation than is typical through the public healthcare system. That psychiatrist wanted me on 100mg.I'm confused now as to what dose to take although my preference is so start slow and gradually work up. Would love to know what dosages you guys are on for your anxiety issues.
depression,Without treatment do anxiety and depression tend to get worse over time or just stay about the same?
depression,If you don't treat your anxiety does it tend to get worse over time or stay the same?
depression,"Hi guys,Saw a psychiatrist last night who pinpointed the depressive aspect of my anxiety / depression as dysthymia.A term I've come across a few times on this subreddit is double depression. I looked up the WebMD page but couldn't quite follow it.Can anybody explain what this is in simple language?I be just started Zoloft (50mg) and talk therapy."
depression,I know this is a weird one but I got back from seeing a psych tonight for anxiety / depression.Seemed like a nice guy but he was rather dour and unhappy looking. I've seen four psychs over the course of my life (chickened out of taking SSRIs twice) and one other guy was the same - literally didn't crack a smile once during our meeting.Tried to warm things up with a little small talk but the guy was having none of it. I know it shouldn't matter (in the sense that having an overweight doctor shouldn't - do as I say not as I am) but I find it makes it a little hard to share intimate information about your mental health when you don't feel at ease socially.Has anybody had a similar experience? I don't want to change doctor just for this reason but it wasn't an experience I'd be in a hurry to repeat.
depression,"I was prescribed 50mg zoloft for anxiety/depression and 25mg nortyptiline for dyspepsia.My psychiatrist wants me to up the Zoloft to 100mg but refused to explain whether I could take the nortyptiline with that higher dose because (in his view) ""I don't need it.""I really disagree because the nort was prescribed by my gastro, the issue emerged after a surgery (so not stress related), and there's no evidence that SSRIs help with gastro problems - only TCAs.So I'd like to ask:Is anybody on 100mg or above of Zoloft (or another SSRI) and 25mg of nortitypiline / amitryptiline.I know that when TCAs and SSRIs are co-prescribed the docs have to be careful because of the risk of serotonin syndrome.I'm seeing my gastro in a month so will ask him what his thoughts are about the combo but would love to gather any anecdotal data I can find in the meantime."
depression,"I know intuitively that pharmacists really don't care about this stuff but it still makes me awkward every time I go the pharmacy to pick up an SSRI (I've just started taking one but have been prescribed them a few times).Picking up benzos makes me feel like a veritable drug addict.I also live in a country in which people aren't known for their sense of discretion. The last time I went to pick up my Zoloft the pharmacist asked me if I would be okay with a different brand. It was definitely audible to other customers!I guess the root of this hang up is that, to me, having a mental health condition is embarrassing. I couldn't care less about picking up antibiotics. But picking up SSRIs still feels weird and hard for me.Just sharing this!"
depression,I've been looking for some time for a medication tracker that has both a smartphone app (I'm on Android) as well as a web UI.Using the phone is of course convenience but equally there are times when I'm at my desk and entering doses from my desktop computer would be a lot more convenient.I love Medisafe (for Android) but there's no website component as far as I can see (at the time of writing).Is there anything that fits the bill?
depression,"*I'm currently writing up some notes for my psychiatrist appointment tomorrow. I've jotted down some bullet points under a heading ""history"" and wanted to share the story here in case it resonated with other sufferers. If this point has no other point, I hope it illustrates why self-medication is a bad approach, how difficult it is to maintain, and why it's prudent to seek better treatment options:*One of the issues that drew me to treatment six months ago was the fact that I needed to greatly cut back on the amount of alcohol I was drinking. To cut it down to a bear minimum. I was diagnosed with gastritis after a surgery a year ago (unrelated to alcohol!) and, to keep it in remission, I've realized that I don't have much leeway. After spending a bit of time thinking about why I was continuing to drink alcohol despite the fact that it was causing me health problems, I concluded that the root of the problem appeared to be that I was drinking a ton of coffee every day. Why? In order to get work done and focus.I'm sorry to say that I was stuck on the caffeine:alcohol seesaw for many years. Potentially as many as 10. Over time, I found that I needed to ingest more caffeine, and drink alcohol more frequently, in order to maintain the desired effect. In other words, there was a tolerance effect. This approach was so unsustainable (the stress of being constantly caffeinated multiplied by the physiological stress from drinking) that it led to periodic ""mini breakdowns"" about once every few months during which I felt that I couldn't go on (before regaining composure). It was after the last of these that my GF basically gave me an ultimatum and told me that I had to seek help.How did this work in practice?By day, I would drink about 5 to 6 cups of coffee depending on my workload in order to focus. By night I would have a beer or two in order to come down from the physical anxiety that the coffee produced and get to sleep. When I say physical anxiety I mean it. As the day went on I began to get shakiness, bursts of tinnitus, and a weird sense of pressure in my head. I began negative and depressed too. I was also of course stimulated like crazy. I *needed* that beer both to get rid of the physical sensations and to come back to planet earth.The longer this went on the more I came to hate this daily routine. I can honestly say that the only drinking I've ever enjoyed is the drinks I have shared with friends socially. Drinking by night (alone) to get to sleep when I was insanely buzzed from coffee at 1 in the morning (just to get a normal day's work done) wasn't enjoyable in the slightest. It was tortuous - particularly when I came to understand that this was impacting my physical health.After several attempts to figure ways out of this mess on a whiteboard, I concluded that there was no way that I was going to be able to figure this out on my own. I had tried everything from meditation to exercise and supplements. Nothing matched coffee's ability to actually get me in a state to focus on tasks. Or alcohol's ability to dial down that anxiety and return me to homeostasis.If I cut out coffee, I simply couldn't focus on anything or get anything done (which in turn made me stressed out and anxious). I tried this a few times and would lie in bed uselessly depressed. If I cut out the alcohol, I would have severe insomnia and anxiety because there was nothing to balance out the coffee.This madness persisted for 5 years or so and another five years if you include the time when I was drinking coffee but not much alcohol and was just anxious a lot of the time. I finally saw a psychiatrist last summer who agreed that I probably have ADHD and wanted me to try Ritalin and then an SSRI if that didn't work.I'm now doing the more complicated business of trying to figure out what's causing what. I was initially diagnosed with ADHD but my ADHD doc now things I have primary mixed anxiety/depression and secondary focus issues. Or possibly both. But he wants me to treat the anxiety before resuming treatment as when I tried Concerta I had horrible depression and anxiety.I'm sharing this in case anybody else has been on the same self-medication ""combo"" of alcohol and caffeine. Given that these are some of the most commonly ingested substances in the world, and both legal, I reckon there have to be plenty out there.Whether you were a fan of espresso and beer or lattes and vodka doesn't matter. I reckon there have to be plenty of people out there that have relied upon these two opposing chemicals to balance their neurochemistry. And if you tried it, you'll probably suffer the same unsuccessful outcome as I did.I'm really hoping that pharmaceutical treatment works for me. If it does, you can bet that I'll be kicking myself for spending years drinking coffee and alcohol when a couple of tiny pills could likely have taken care of the same issues. If you managed to get off the seesaw, as I'm hoping to do, then kindly share how you did that and what worked for you. So that others who are looking to replace self-medication with actual medication can be encouraged that there are answers out there.Thanks for reading!"

depression,"Hi guys,I'm not sure that this is an OCD trait or not which is why I am posting here. For reference: I have GAD and have just started Zoloft.One of my weird idiosyncrasies (which thankfully nobody knows about!) is that I will avoid typing out certain words.For instance: I'm currently creating a Google Drive folder in which I plan on adding a bunch of mental health resources.So I'm creating my subfolders 'Anxiety,' 'ADHD,' 'OCD,' — but then when it comes to depression I can't quite bring myself to write it out. So instead I create a folder called 'Dep' which will be my secret shorthand.Why do I do this? I have no idea! It's like to avoid giving power to something I'm scared of or ashamed about I guess. I do the same thing about the current virus engulfing the world, even in conversation. I call it ""the pandemic.""Anybody have something simillar?"
depression,"Are there any good documentaries out there that cover mental health related themes including anxiety, depression, addiction, and psychiatric treatment?"
depression,"I'm in the process of figuring out what's causing what in my mental health picture.I saw a psychiatrist in the summer because I have trouble focusing on anything that doesn't really interest me (namely: work!). He suggested that I try a stimulant med and then an SSRI if that didn't help.I also have GAD, possible OCD, and almost certainly depression.The stimulant (Concerta) made me extremely depressed. So the ADHD guy sent me back to the psychiatrist.Now I've started the SSRI and (although it's very early days) I feel like my focus/concentration is already a little better. Today, I finished an entire book — which I haven't done in a while (I literally have 8 half read books by my bedside).Has anybody had issues with concentration and focus that looked a lot like ADHD but ultimately turned out to be nothing more than symptoms of depression?"

depression,"Hi /r/anxiety,I saw a psychiatrist in the summer due to trouble focusing on work (particularly work that I wasn't interested in). I've also previously been diagnosed with GAD and reckon that I have OCD too ... although I was never able to summon up the courage to take SSRIs.He wasn't sure whether my issues were due to a combination of anxiety and ADHD or just anxiety. So his recommended course of action was to try a stimulant and if that failed to try an SSRI.After having a bad reaction to stimulant medication I'm now on plan B. I've just started the SSRI and have been having an easier time focusing on a book I'm currently reading .. which is a big yardstick for me.My question is whether anybody here has had trouble with focus/concentration and ADHD-like symptoms that all actually turned out to be due to an anxiety disorder? If so - did you manage to treat those with an SSRI?Thanks!"
depression,I'm currently working with a psychiatrist and ADHD doc (in my case different people) to get to the root of my issues with focus and concentration. Neither doc seems really certain whether I have ADHD and anxiety/depression or whether it all just stems from the latter.As I had a bad reaction to Concerta (got really depressed) I'm now trying an SSRI.Is there such a thing as ADHD like symptoms caused by anxiety? And if so has anybody noticed an improvement just by taking an SSRI (without any stimulant medication)?It's very early days for me but I'm noticing that I'm having a much easier time reading since I started the SSRI — which is always my yardstick for how my concentration is doing.
depression,I'm currently on day four of Zoloft at 25mg.I know theses things aren't supposed to really kick in for six weeks or so but I've been noticing subtle improvements in my mood already.Yesterday I used my exercise bike for the first time in months without even really thinking about it! Today I got out for a walk in the sun and was able to actually concentrate on what I was reading for a change.Placebo or are something quick / early gains indeed possible?
depression,"This is going to be a weird post so bear with me:I recently watched a TV show which depicted one of the characters going through depression and anxiety and getting diagnosed.After meeting with a psychiatrist and starting treatment she was moved to some sort of rehab facility. It depicted a daily agenda of group therapy and other activities but didn't really go into too much detail.If one wanted to try to recreate that kind of healing timetable within the comfort of their own home, how should they structure their day?"
depression,And if so what medications are you taking?
depression,"Hi!Is there any guide out there that runs through the various forms of talk therapy being used and explains their evolution and differences - including ACT, CBT, and DBT, among others?"
depression,"So I'm sure that this has been asked before but I couldn't find it using the search function.Untreated / undertreated ADHD can cause anxiety. You can also have an anxiety disorder alongside your ADHD.Finally, anxiety can cause trouble concentrating.How do doctors tell these things apart?"
depression,I'm relatively recently diagnosed and have been treated with Concerta so far.The focus was brilliant but I got scarily depressed on the way down. I didn't feel myself. And then got super anxious when I came off the med (ADHD doc told me to stop).I was hoping we could try something else but my ADHD doc (who I like and trust) was adamant that I need to get my mood disorder seen to first before we try alternatives.I guess I was hoping that everything was secondary to ADHD but he seems to strongly think that I have ADHD + anxiety/depression (and that my atypical reaction to Concerta was a clue in this direction). Or maybe everything is even secondary to the latter! I don't know how they know these things but that's kind of been my burning question from the start!Anyway - just wondering how common this kind of experience is. In his words more or less: we always treat the mood disorder before we treat the ADHD.I'm somewhat bummed out (I just want to find the right med and move on with things!) but also happy to finally be making progress and on some kind of journey!
depression,"I've been taking Concerta for the past six weeks or so. Very recently diagnosed.The focus was great but ... it triggered some major depression on the downswing. Like seriously bad. I also got severe anxiety after I stopped taking the drug which I recently wasn't expecting.My ADHD doc (who I really like!) said that he wasn't sure if I have ADHD with secondary anxiety/depression or coexisting disorders (or maybe even just the latter). But that this information had made him strongly believe I have a psychiatric problem that the Concerta just blew up.He told me that as much as he wants to treat the ADHD and is pretty sure that I have it, psychiatric problems are always a bigger priority and that I need to go to a psychiatrist first and get my mood stable first. I'm slightly disappointed that we only tried one drug for six weeks. Is this common? I'm not arguing with his judgment and have to go along with his gameplan anyway. But would be curious to hear what people's experiences have been in terms of treating the conditions by priority."
depression,"I grew up with a really overbearing mother who was always in my business.Think stuff like opening my mail, barging into my room unannounced, and eavesdropping pm my phone conversations.As a reaction to this I've become super cagey about sharing information. This has bled into my marriage.While I trust my GF and talk about everything with her (including my mental health issues) I'm currently angling my phoney away from her so that she can't see what I'm doing with it.Has anybody developed this kind of thing from their childhood?I know that paranoia is a symptom of some non anxiety mental health stuff but... I think this is more an ingrained habit than my natural way of being."
depression,Has anybody had a diagnosis of anxiety secondary to ADHD or a dual diagnosis of anxiety and ADHD and then found out that all their concentration and focus problems were just attributable to an anxiety disorder? I guess more likely for ADHD-PI.
depression,So there was a thread here a while back about how people with anxiety who don't respond to SSRIs might actually have ADHD.I would like to ask whether that process can apply in reverse.Without any doubt I'm crazy anxious. I also have OCD tendencies. One of my main issues is also trouble focusing. Particularly if I'm not interested in the subject. The question in my case however is what's the primary cause and whether its anxiety that gives ADHD-like symptoms or ADHD with secondary anxiety. It seems that my psych wasn't sure so suggested trying Ritalin and then an SSRI if that didn't work. Which is what happened: the ADHD med but me into a depressive tailspin.Anyway just curious if this kind of thing can happen. People who think they have ADHD only to learn that it's all just an anxiety disorder.(Final complication: of course ADHD and anxiety can also be comorbid!)
depression,"Hi /r/CPTSD,Currently in the process of untangling my mental health problems. Current diagnoses: anxiety, depression, and (maybe) also ADHD.The most notable feature of my childhood was my late father's alcoholism and my mom's failure to do anything about it. Which meant that we effectively had a bedridden alcoholic living with us during the last months of his life.I have so many painful memories from those years. Fighting and screaming. Fearing for my mother's safety when she confronted my father about his drinking. Her uncompassionate response to his addiction. Being driven drunk as a child.I am new to exploring this whole world of CPTSD and am wondering if these are the kind of painful traumas that can trigger these conditions. If so I have a whole world to explore as to what to do with these memories (books would be a great start and I'm also in therapy) . I don't have flashbacks per se... but do periodically think about them.TY"
depression,"Something that's been very helpful in mental health journey so far is identifying forms of self medication and trying to understand why I'm engaging in those behaviours (mostly substances).My two long terms companions have been caffeine and alcohol. Caffeine has been what has allowed me to summon up the motivation to actually get out of bed and get to work. Alcohol has been the drug that has allowed me to come down from the anxiety that the first form of self medication produces.I have some mixture of ADHD, anxiety, and depression. My goal through medication is to use no substances for mood management."
depression,I saw a psych in the summer for difficulty summoning up the motivation to get going with work and difficulty concentrating (as well as overall hopelessness at the state of my career!)The psych seemed unsure whether I had ADHD or depression so suggested we try the different meds. I opted for Ritalin first but that made me extremely depressed.Now I'm trying Zoloft.Basically: can depression throw up many of the same symptoms that ADHD would in terms of impaired concentration and focus... without ADHD being the actual underlying cause?
depression,"Just wanted to express gratitude to nobody in particular (although I guess to Reddit itself) for facilitating so many important subreddits to do with mental health.I've been a passive Reddit user for a few years. But up until discovering places like this and /r/depression I actually had a very negative view of the social network. I see so much anger, nastiness and toxicity here that it's depressing.It's nice that just as anonymity can breed all of that stuff, it can also allow strangers to come together to help one another through mental health problems. I think of it as the upside to all that bad stuff."
depression,"I was thinking of putting a couple of ""emergency"" doses of my SSRI in this little keychain pill finder thing and giving one to my GF ... just to sort of cover all eventualities.Is it really important to store the pills in the blister backs they came in ... or is there a bit of leeway in this respect?"
depression,"Hi /r/depression,I saw a psychiatrist in the summer.For as long as I can remember I've ""needed"" coffee to get work done that I didn't like. The motivation and focus just isn't there. But equally, I feel stuck doing what I'm doing for a living partially because of low self esteem and confidence issues. I'm underachieving.The psych recommended that I try an ADHD drug. And if that doesn't work, to go on an SSRI. As the ADHD drug (Concerta) massively worsened my depression to the point of causing suicidal ideation, we're now onto plan B.Something interesting I picked up in the ADHD subreddit is how depression and ADHD can look really alike. You can have both, ADHD that (untreated) leads to depression or (I've heard) depression that causes symptoms that look an awful lot like ADHD.Does anybody else here have depression that created problems that look like ADHD (difficulty concentrating, focusing on work, motivation) ... but which ultimately proved themselves to be depression related?"
depression,"With my psychiatrist's permission and understanding, I came off my Concerta (18mg) a few days ago. It was giving me severe depression verging on suicidal ideation, which I have never experienced before. Thankfully that cleared up almost as soon as I quit the drug.Since coming off the drug, however, I have been having crazy panic attacks. I do have anxiety (so am about to start on an SSRI) but ... I've had maybe three panic attacks prior to the last few days, and have been having them pretty much every day since.Is there something about coming off an ADHD med that can increase anxiety?"

depression,"I'm resuming therapy tomorrow so this is definitely going to be the core thing I focus on. But I thought it might also be useful to sound out Reddit for advice.I grew up with a difficult single parent mother who continues to present mental health problems for me (I have touches of anxiety and depression).My mom is definitely the controlling type and constantly tells me that I'm not measuring up with what I do professionally. She has a very fixed idea for the type of jobs she considers to be ""worthy"" (lawyer, doctor) and also adheres to a very rigid idea of class structure.In her eyes, because I work in marketing, I'm doing something ""untraditional"" (and she doesn't bother even pretending to care about what I do). Because I'm now self-employed, she thinks that I need to urgently ""fix"" my ""failing"" career. And because of my income (not being in the lawyer tier) she treats me like some sort of undignified failure (the only type of people she tries to associate with are upper class).Actually, come to think of it, there hasn't really been any obvious point in my life at which my mom *wasn't* telling me that I was failing in some respect or in some sort of crisis. I guess because I have been ignoring her edicts.As time has gone on, I've started realizing that maybe I'm doing okay. Maybe I can be satisfied and happy with what I've got and have achieved. I've also realized that I have a really hard time understanding what *I* want in life. Because so many decisions have been tainted by my mom interjecting her unwanted opinion and trying to impose her value system on top of mine. As I escape her grip by becoming more independent things naturally get a little easier. But equally it leads me to question: so who exactly am I and what I do want out of life? And have the decisions I've taken to get here been my own or hers?In a weird way: while I *think* I know what I want I'm sometimes driven crazy wondering whether that voice is mine or that of my mother.I also need to figure out some way to let go of a lifetime of conditioning that I'm doing poorly. This has both made me unhappy and enormously damaged by self esteem.Appreciative of any suggestions."
depression,"My current diagnosis is ADHD with secondary anxiety/depression. Although my ADHD doc did mention that the depression could be an independent condition / comorbidity rather than a consequence of the ADHD.My GF asked me recently whether my pdoc had ever considered the question of bipolar illness. She has noticed that when I'm having a bad day with my concentration that I'll be snappy and can have mood swings.I think she is wrong (my mood swings are not that dramatic or frequently occurring) but it did make me wonder when, when we visit a psychiatrist or other mental health professional, they consider *all* the possible conditions that could give rise to those symptoms.Like — if we don't tell them that we are worried about X condition ... could they arrive at that conclusion anyway? Is there any one size fits all questionnaire that they use that could diagnose everything from psychosis to anxiety to depression and everything in between?Would just love to know how it works."
depression,Something I noticed in the last week is that I feel depressed immediately after drinking alcohol — so I've begun a mission to essentially cut it out (I also need to get off caffeine - the two seem to go hand in hand for me).I know that caffeine is a depressant. And I know that a lot of people report feeling blue the day after drinking.I'm not talking about that. I mean immediately (like within 30 minutes) of having a drink I'll start to feel a bit sad and downbeat. Anybody familiar with this?
depression,"Hi /r/depressionregimens,So my gastro has put me on a very low dose of amitryptiline (50mg) for dyspepsia.I also need a bit of help in the anxiety/depression department and consulted with a psych who said that taking 50mg of Zoloft at the same time was fine. Apparently quite a lot of people are on both a TCA and an SSRI and there's no major risk of serotonin syndrome so long as both dosages are low.My question is whether starting both at the same time would be a bad idea or whether it would be better to stagger them. I've currently started neither. Nobody mentioned what to do in this respect.Thank you in advance!"
depression,"Checked out some of the comments [in this amazing thread about hyperfocusing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/k49c4l/have_you_hyperfocused_on_so_many_different_topics/) and I can relate so much to many people that it's weird.The particular facet of my ADHD that is just falling into place now (that thread helped me see it) is the fact that my tendency to hyperfocus on an endless list of things that interest me has had a weird downside.For one, I have no knowledge of pop culture whatsoever. Which actually makes it hard to engage in small talk and form friends sometimes.My list of interests is super niche (building computers for one but there are many other) and it's just not the kind of thing you can use to segue into a conversation with most neurotypical people.I actually thought until recently that all geeks were like me. Until I discovered that even the smartest guy that I know (a PHd genius type who works in something to do with game theory) spends most of his downtime Netflix and chilling. Ie, he's both super smart *and* is into things that normal people are!For me pop culture and sports are uninteresting. So I just zone them out of my life and focus on other things.As a result I have no idea what Games of Thrones is about. Or House of Cards. I don't know what movies are playing or even the names of some common celebrities. I heard about these things from friends but have actually no idea what they're about.Anyway just thought I share. It's really helpful to be able to put the pieces together!"
depression,"I'm currently working with a psychiatrist to get to the bottom of my mental health issues. My chief complaint is difficulty focusing and difficulty getting start with work that I'm not interested in which, sadly, is most of my current work. I also get into 'downer' moods on weekends when I'm not super busy with work and distracted.The possibilities, as he has explained them are:* Primary ADHD with secondary  anxiety/depression* Primary anxiety/depression with secondary ADHD* Just anxiety/depression* Both ADHD and anxiety/depressionObviously, I'm not asking for a diagnosis here as my situation is unique. But for those with ADHD and comorbid depression and/or anxiety: how did your doctors figure out what was causing what when both problems can cause difficulties with concentration, irritability, etc?"
depression,"I was checking out this sub last night and there are a ton of posts on here along the lines of:* I've been on Lexapro for a week. Can I stop cold turkey?* I've been on Prozac for 6 months. Can I stop cold turkey?Etc, etc.From what I understand the following factors are associated with longer and more severe withdrawal syndromes:* The strength of the drug taken* The duration of the therapyAre there any objective (preferably evidence based) guidelines that allow users to predict the likelihood and/or severity of a withdrawal they might experience? Or is it all just guesswork?"
depression,"I've heard a few times that Prozac is considered the easiest SSRI to withdraw from owing to its long half life.Fear of antidepressant withdrawal and brain zaps in particular has kept me from getting the help that I have needed for years. Although recently I feel like things are coming to something of a head and that I have to bite the bullet.I've been offered Lexapro and Zoloft so far but intend asking my family doctor if he can prescribe the dose equivalent of 50mg Zoloft as Prozac (which I believe is 20mg).I intend tapering very carefully when/if I need to come off the medication, but want to do everything possible to stack the odds of that process being easy in my favor.TY"
depression,"I'm currently going through the diagnostic process trying to get my mental health in order.For years, I've had trouble getting motivated to work and focusing on my work. To self-medicate, I drunk a ton of coffee. Which worked for many years until I developed an anxiety disorder as a result of that and post-surgery stomach problems, which the coffee clearly wasn't helping with either.In addition to the anxiety, I periodically get very down. This tends to happen on weekends when I'm not distracted by the constant activity of work. I used alcohol to keep that feeling at bay until, again for health reasons, that stopped being a viable option.My initial diagnosis was ADHD with probable secondary anxiety/depression. I've started taking Ritalin and the effect is super-weird: I get all the focus and willpower that I needed from coffee but none of the mood lift which I've become accustomed to. Hence, my depression is now as untreated as it's ever been and probably at its worst.My gut feeling (and I think what my psychiatrist was unsure about) was that I might just have plain 'ol depression. And the trouble focusing and difficulty getting working were all flowing than that. Thus, I think the ADHD diagnosis might have been a misdiagnosis. Or that I have primary depression and secondary ADHD or depression and ADHD, which can be comorbid.I'm not asking for a diagnosis of course (have my psychiatrist for that thankfully), but would love to know whether anybody gone through this process, struggling to figure out whether your trouble focusing is from ADHD or depression? And if so, how did you and your medical team make that determination in the end?"

depression,"I've been prescribed a low does TCA for digestive issues after a stomach surgery.I recently gave up coffee to try help my digestion. I'd been on coffee for many years to help me focus. It helped but gave me a lot of anxiety. That fact led me to a diagnosis of ADHD. The Ritalin helps me focus, but I've been incredibly depressed since I made the switch. My hunch is that depression, rather than ADHD, is the root cause of my focus issues. So I asked to see a psychiatrist.Psychiatrist said that because I'd be on a low dose of the TCA that adding a low dose SSRI (Zoloft, 50mg) was safe.Has anybody been on this combination? Are there any side effects that are likely to be compounded by taking the two together? I was very worried about serotonin syndrome naturally but she said that once both were taken at low dosages that there wasn't a significant risk."
depression,"Does anybody ever look at their ADHD medication and wonder how one tiny pill can have such a dramatic and lifechanging effect?I actually find it really liberating.It's easy to think of ADHD as this massive obstacle to success and happiness. Which untreated it kind of is.But all that's required to put a rather enormous dent in it, and to balance out our brain chemistry to keep the right level of dopamine flowing around our brains, is to ingest a tablet that weighs a couple of dozen miligrams and is less than a centimeter in diameter?And if you're on one of the XR formulas, you basically only need to take *one* of those tablets per day?Pretty mindblowing when you think about it!When I pop that pill in the morning, all I can think about is how stupid I was for not getting to the root of my focus issues a dozen years ago and to keep drinking coffee instead — which, even from a physical standpoint, requires a lot more work (beans, grinding, hot water, dosing every few hours, etc).I don't know what I was expecting when I thought about what taking Ritalin would look like, but somehow I know it wasn't this. The thing is less than the size of a fricking breath mint. And it allows me to achieve focus that I would have literally given anything for back when I was in school.It also puts this condition into perspective for me.How bad could it (I) be if all I need to get it under control is taking a minuscule circular tablet once a day?I guess you could make the same point about any medication and obviously their effects far outstrip their size. Antianxiety meds, antidepressant meds etc. I've only just started taking them, but I already realize that ADHD meds aren't perfect. But it's pretty amazing to reflect upon how something so small (in physical size) can have such a profound and lifechanging effect. You could probably fit a 5 year supply inside a coffee jar if you really wanted to. That's pretty powerful and liberating!Anyway, just sharing this thought. Modern medicine has its downsides for sure. But it's pretty amazing to think that something that can greatly improve focus is a fraction the size of a cent coin.(Going for the success/celebration flair as I can't think of something that fits better!)"
depression,"I've only been diagnosed with ADHD for a few weeks.Initially, my doctor put me on instant release (IR) Ritalin. Which worked fine.When I saw an ADHD specialist, however, he said that extended release medications make much more sense. So I'm now on Concerta.I read there that many people take an IR ""booster"" in the late afternoon when their XR med is wearing off.I'm currently pulling pretty long hours trying to clear out a backlog of work and could use the extra boost.I'm definitely going to ask my doctor at our next scheduled appointment, but for those that take the IR booster, how often after the XR dose do you generally take it? 12 hours - as long as it's supposed to last? Whenever you feel like you need it?"
depression,"I'm recently diagnosed with ADHD.Looking back at my life, one thing that I suspect may be fairly commonplace is my tendency to go through a ton of different hobbies and interests.Typically, for me, it goes something like this (note: I'm referring to my undiagnosed, unmedicated life to date rather than the present):I find something that catches my interest (for argument's sake, let's say North Korea). I will become temporarily obsessed by it (hyperfocus) and go ""all in"" in an exaggerated manner. To follow through with the example, I'll watch every documentary about NK, read books, etc. But eventually, I'll learn everything that interests me about it and become bored; the minutiae don't tend to interest me.This cycle has continued basically throughout my life. My friends and family call this my ""phases"". I call it being me.There are a few interests that I've stuck with consistently. But my greater tendency is more to shift through a long list of them, switching as soon as my initial interest and enthusiasm wanes and the next thing catches it. Having been like this my whole life to date, I thus know a little about a lot. Which isn't terribly useful for the way our job market and society is architected. Of course, it's cool to have wide general knowledge. But I feel like my career would have benefited had I been able to maintain focus on a smaller pool of subjects and become an expert in them. Experts are what our society values, after all.Can anybody relate?"
depression,"Saw my ADHD doctor last week and was switched from what the initial psychiatrist I saw prescribed (instant release Ritalin) to Concerta, once daily.My question is why the extended release ADHD meds seem to generally be formulated to last for 12 hours?Adhasia XR is the only long release med that I could see which lasts 16 hours.Given that doctors generally advise that we sleep for 8 hours per night and there are 24 hours in the day, surely 16 hours rather than 12 is the optimal coverage period? Or was the 12 hours chosen deliberately so that there would be a come down before bed?Has anybody tried 12 and 16 hour XR meds and can compare the experience?"
depression,"I've been on medication for ADHD for two weeks today.One of the most surprising effects so far is that my cravings for alcohol, which used to be nightly (primarily to come down from caffeine - or so I thought) have been virtually eliminated.This is great news for me because I have gastritis and need to greatly reduce my alcohol use in order to get that back into remission.I came across this ([admittedly similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jhkejh/stims_curbing_alcohol_use/)) thread in which a commenter said that this is due to the effect that our dopamine levels are now higher so we don't crave the boost from alcohol.Is this really the explanation or are their others?My thinking was more that I was using alcohol because I was frustrated at not being able to focus and achieve much with my (then) unmedicated brain. But come to think of it, if I achieved a lot during a day, I would use alcohol as a reward too.Of course, there's still the behavioral aspect. I feel like this is residual for me (two weeks isn't a long time to change a years-long habit). And that as I get used to not craving alcohol I will simply stop drinking it altogether or barely at all. I had a drink last night when watching Netflix, but that was purely out of habit. I didn't feel like I needed it - or even particularly wanted it!Basically:Is this common? And what's the explanation?"
depression,"I had a good consultation with my ADHD specialist earlier in the week who diagnosed me with ADHD and (likely) secondary anxiety / depression.The question he was trying to address seemed to be the chicken and egg conundrum: did I have trouble concentrating because I was anxious and/or depressed or was I anxious and/or depressed because I had ADHD?I guess he must have arrived at the first conclusion, although he said that he wasn't excluding the possibility that I had both and would also need to go on an antidepressant.My question is how doctors are able to distinguish these two conditions when the symptoms overlap and for many people it's credible that one condition caused the other (and vice versa)?"
depression,"Hi guys,So I had a good consultation with an ADHD specialist today.He wrote me as having ""ADHD with likely secondary mixed anxiety depression"".However, even he didn't seem so sure whether my ADHD caused anxiety/depression or whether perhaps because I was anxious/depressed I was having trouble with focus and motivation. Or maybe I simply have both?Is there any reliable ways for clinicians, and us, to tell this? And does it even matter?The first psych I saw offered me *either* ADHD medicine or an antidepressant — on the spot. I opted for the ADHD medicine and have been a lot less anxious since taking it. However, part of me wonders whether I have a separate depression and anxiety disorder going on that the ADHD treatment isn't going to touch.Basically how do we, and doctors, go about pulling these two conditions, which so frequently coexist, apart?"
depression,"So I was recently prescribed Ritalin for ADHD. I have been abusing caffeine for basically 10+ years as a form of self medication for my focus. Initially tea, then coffee, then coffee powder in smoothies (an interesting phase), and finally caffeine pills.I wasn't sure really what to expect with Ritalin, as it was the first pharma stimulant I have ever taken, but so far I have noticed a few remarkable differences from caffeine.Some observations:* **There seems to be strong cross-tolerance between these two drugs**. I went cold turkey on about 500mg of caffeine in pill form. Under normal circumstances, that should have resulted in a pretty bad few days of lethargy and headaches. But, as I started the Ritalin immediately, I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing.* **Ritalin provokes way less anxiety for me than caffeine does.** This was basically why I sought diagnosis and realized that I should stop attempting to treat my focus issues with less effective OTC stims. My daily caffeine binges were causing me to crave alcohol at night which was messing up my stomach (I have gastritis). It was like a physical anxiety (head tension, etc) that would set in after the caffeine high had dissipated and which I needed to damp down with alcohol in order to sleep and not have a panic attack (yes, that bad). This effect seems to be far, far less pronounced with Ritalin or not there at all. Sure, there's a comedown in terms of feeling sleepy and like ""screw it, I'm done work for the day"". But I don't feel that overwhelming anxiety, which caused a craving to drink, that caffeine gave me. I attributed this effect, of caffeine, to a glutamate surge. Although that's just me playing armchair doctor.Some other interesting properties that I've only thought of recently:* **Caffeine is known to deplete several minerals from the body, including magnesium**. As far as I know, Ritalin doesn't have this effect. This is a major plus for Ritalin in my opinion. (If anybody has a source contradicting this, I'd be grateful if you could point it out)* **Caffeine, to me, feels like a better bronchodilator than Ritalin.** I have asthma and caffeine's positive effect on my asthma control was one of the reasons I stayed on it for so long as it also allowed me to put off dealing with that properly. With Ritalin, I don't notice much of a beneficial effect on my breathing, although I found one study which stated that it increased lung volume* I don't know how Ritalin and caffeine compare in terms of their effect on blood pressure. Ritalin is known to increase it too, but I feel like to a lesser extent.Basically, I'm beyond amazed that Ritalin can provide all the stimulation and focus-enhancing benefits of caffeine while also being a very different drug in many important respects — and I would say, for treating focus, a better one than caffeine. The anxiety effect, for me, is a total game-changer and might allow me to move on with my life with better focus and without an anxiety problem to go hand in hand with it. The lack of mineral depletion (I hope) is also a major plus. My magnesium level has always been slightly below the range, which in turn can cause anxiety.That's all I have to say for now. Although I've been using caffeine for 10+ years and Ritalin for about 2 weeks so I'm very early in the game!"

depression,"I write a reasonably popular blog for friends and family and have a newsletter following of a few hundred subscribers. Separately, I write some posts on Medium.As a freelance writer, writing is both my profession and a passion. I channel my thoughts into writing and use my writing, wherever it is published, to document my evolution as a person and that of my thinking over time.Down the line (not right now, I've just been diagnosed) I know that I would *love* to write something about my diagnostic journey. How I self-medicated with caffeine and other substances. How I looked into many diagnoses but never even considered ADHD until I read *Driven to Distraction*. I doubt this would be the best thing ever written about ADHD, but I feel like every story is important and might resonate with somebody in need of help/support.My only hesitation about doing this would be that this might have some kind of negative repercussions on my professional life. Might clients find the post and be turned off working with me as a result? I'm sure there would be other possible downfalls.Have people done it? Deliberated about doing it like me? And what are some of the pros and cons?"
depression,"I've been working as a freelance writer for the past number of years. For the most part, it's good, and I enjoy the work. I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD. I'm now on Ritalin. Before that, I was self-medicating with a heavy daily dose of caffeine. I couldn't write, or get much work done at all, without a cup of coffee every few hours.I'm a bit perplexed about how to feel about being a writer with ADHD. On the one hand, I've read that ADHD is prevalent among creatives. On the other, I can think of few occupations and activities that require as much concentration as writing. So part of me thinks that I'm in the worst possible career for somebody with this type of brain. Have any writers transitioned into something else once they discovered they had ADHD? Can you be a successful writer *with* the condition?"
depression,"So as I posted recently I've only recently been diagnosed with ADHD.Before that, I spent many years struggling to get through daily work and drinking rather massive amounts of caffeine to keep going. It was effectively, I believe, self-medicating.The negative of this was that caffeine is obviously terrible for anxiety, especially in large quantities. In fact, I'm still not sure whether I have anxiety or whether the anxiety I have developed is just a byproduct of self-medicating that might hopefully go away now that I'm on a proper drug.**My question, for anybody that's come through a similar process, is whether caffeine or Ritalin produces more anxiety and unpleasant side effects?** Obviously, ADHD meds produce *some* anxiety as they are stimulants. But my hope would be that they have a lower side effect profile than caffeine (and, of course, they are stronger stimulants).Would love to here the experiences of anybody that has tried treating ADHD with both. I'm too early into my Ritalin treatment to really be able to comment. But so far it seems to me as if it's far less anxiety-producing than caffeine is."

depression,"Presume that many of you have had some sort of moment of realization that ultimately led to your ADHD diagnosis.Mine was reading *Driven to Distraction*. It felt like a story of my life to date. Smart but can't quite focus on something deeply enough to be as successful as I could be. Unfulfilled potential. Something not quite right.The other lightbulb moment was sitting in my psychiatrist's office and trying to explain why I felt compelled to drink coffee every day (I came in because I want to stop drinking alcohol and I was using that to dampen down end of day anxiety from drinking lots of it). He asked: ""but why do you *have* to drink coffee in order to focus and get work done?"" And that question kind of answered itself.What was the defining moment that made you know, or feel pretty sure, that you have ADHD?"
depression,"So I've recently started ADHD medication after basically self medicating with massive coffee intake for.. maybe 10 years.Coffee worked reasonably well to get me focused but it's downside was that I would crave alcohol at the end of the day just to get a break from the stimulation. I also had a lot of anxiety... which could be natural or could have been a side effect. I've only been taking Ritalin for a few days. But so far I feel like the effect is comparable. After being stimulated for an entire day, I still find myself craving a drink just to sort of snap out of the hyperfocused feeling.Has anybody else encountered something similar? Perhaps some drugs are better than others in this respect? TY"
depression,"Hi there, Recently diagnosed with ADHD. Had anxiety for most of my life. Panic attacks and GAD. Been offered SSRI s but never took them. I get by right now with the odd Xanax. I've been self medicating ADHD for years with caffeine. Obviously this exacerbates anxiety. Being stimulated all day also makes me seriously crave alcohol when I've got my work done. And giving up alcohol is an important health objective for me right now.Just wondering if there are any posters here with this dual diagnosis? And if so what treatment plan / medications your psychs have you on?Ritalin, which I've just started, is amazing for focus. But I find it has a similar effect with regard to end of of day alcohol cravings. Ie, I'll seek out something to come down from the rush of stimulation.If anybody has a similar background and has found a drug regiment that treats the ADHD without exacerbating anxiety (or ideally simultaneously treating it), I'd love to hear about it."
depression,"Just wondering if there are posters here with both ADHD and anxiety (specifically GAD with occasional panic attacks.)I've been self medicating ADHD for years with caffeine.

depression,"Hi guys,Just wondering how people here measure the interval between taking their ADHD medication?I've been using the Medisafe app for another drug that I take and it's quite good. But the notifications, and having to check your phone periodically, get a little annoying.Do you measure your X hours between doses down to the minute using something similar (or just remembering the hour)? Or are you not that precise and judge by symptoms instead?TIA"
depression,"So:I reckon I've been using caffeine to self-medicate my recently diagnosed ADHD for quite some time. I sought diagnosis and treatment primarily because of the obvious side effects. Caffeine really helps me to focus, but my anxiety was through the roof and my sleeping was screwed up.After transitioning from coffee, I've been ingesting 400-500mg of caffeine pills every day for about the past 3 months.If my Ritalin treatment is successful, then I would like to never touch caffeine pills again. There's nothing recreational about them and if I can focus without them, I would have no desire to use them.My question is whether anybody on this sub has experience coming off caffeine while going on Ritalin or Adderall? Is there a cross tolerance effect between the two medications?  Any general info or anecdotal experience would be great just to know what to expect (not looking for advice specifically)."
depression,"Hi /r/ADHD!I'm about to start Ritalin this week and am a little apprehensive but also excited.My theory is that I've been self-medicating my ADHD (just diagnosed) with caffeine for like .... potentially 15 years.Firstly it was tea, then coffee, and now it's caffeine pills. Caffeine pills have actually made the idea of getting proper treatment easier as now it feels like just swapping one pharmaceutical for another. Has anybody gone from self-mediating with caffeine to proper drugs? And how much better was your ADHD control as a result?I know Ritalin will objectively be much better. But I feel weirdly attached to caffeine as my crutch for getting stuff done and focusing after having used it for like .... literally more than 10 years. Looking forward to hearing anybody's experiences."
depression,i absolutely hate myself
depression,"i hate when people assume that i self harm because i'm doing badly. i'm getting so much better, and i'm much happier than before. i still cut because it's comforting, fun, and it feels good. idk if i'll ever stop, and i don't see any reason to."
depression,"a few days ago i did cuts on my stomach, and i got scars for the first time, so i was really proud of myself. but i remembered that my mom will eventually make me go to the pool, and i only have bikinis :( idk what i'm gonna do, it's been a few days and they're still there"
depression,"i'm lying on the bathroom floor. i've been crying for hours. i was hit with a ginormous ball of emotion. my friends and i got sappy and i just burst. it feels like i've never felt emotion before now. it's been that long. it feels scary. i don't know what i'm going to do. i feel so different, like i'm in a new world now. i think things are finally looking up. i might be ok now. idk, maybe it's just the meds. i feel like just sleeping on the bathroom floor. i can't handle this, emotion is not something i'm good at, or remember feeling at all. i feel numb, yet emotional.sorry to bother you and waste your time, but i just wanna say that it gets better. of course, i'm not 100% sure yet, it might be the meds or lack of sleep talking, but i'm.. ok. and you'll be too.edit: to whoever was concerned and sent me the crisis hotline, i'm okay."
depression,"i also got prescribed with antidepressants. i really hope it helps, ive been trying to get some sort of medication for a while."
depression,"so i self harm sometimes. and i'm wondering why. so here are the reasons i can think of, please tell me yours.1. i hate myself sometimes. i dont think i deserve anything but pain at moments. 2. i get satisfaction out of it. i like the pain and feeling my scars.3. it's like art to me? does anyone else feel that way? i think of it as an art form and i'm always proud of the outcome.4. to feel something. i usually can't feel any feelings, so i make myself feel pain.5. it's fun and it's something to do. i'm always bored, so self harm had become a new hobby?what are your reasons? i'm curious."
depression,"i'm 13 and i've tried drowning myself; it didn't work. my family doesn't know that i want to die and have purposefully hurt myself before. today, i told them how a girl at school said i laugh a lot for being depressed. i told my family that of course i laugh, i'm not always gonna try to distance myself from my friends just because i'm depressed. (almost every day i have depressive episodes where i can't manage to be around people.) my family said that if i really was depressed, i would never laugh. i don't think this is true. almost every morning, i have little to no motivation and consider killing myself. i want to be okay, so i laugh to hide the pain. i don't think my family understands that by downgrading my depression, they are making it worse. i can't stop crying now and i want to hurt myself."
autism,"I need some advice on setting boundaries with new friends. I meet a lot of people online and one thing I get a lot of is people not being very good with texting or messaging. Like just disappearing mid conversation or not responding for days or weeks. A lot of times they'll come back and say ""I'm sorry"" or whatever and I'm not unsympathetic. I get that shit happens. So my usual response is ""no worries"" or something like that. The issue is 9 out of 10 times it's not a ""shit happens"" type of thing. It ends up being a pattern. That kind of pattern is not something that I'm okay with. I'm not saying it's morally wrong or they're bad people or bad friends but they're not really friends I want around. Or rather I should say I would prefer if they would meet me in the middle somewhere. Like I don't want to just write someone off entirely because they do that because most of the time they don't know I don't like it because I just say ""no worries"" every time. My difficulty is figuring out a way to say ""I don't want to be friends with you if you can't be a little more consistent"" without phrasing it that way. I think if I could have done this in the past I would have a lot fewer resentments, hurt feelings, and ultimately heartache. It's just so foreign to me and I have no idea how to go about it."
autism,"I'm both pretty new to the world of trauma and kind of an old hand at it. I realized many years ago that when I went through as a kid was traumatic, and that led me to even more traumatic events as an adult, but I never really thought it was THAT bad. Like I knew my dad was abusive but he only hit me a few times when I was very young so I didn't seem like a big deal. I knew my mom was controlling but, again, could have been worse. Then I realized how badly it was affecting my romantic relationships and I acknowledged that, while it could have been worse, it was bad enough to be very valid and to profoundly affect me. But I still only really thought of it in the context of romantic relationships. I didn't really realize until recently how it has affected every aspect of my life and especially how I feel emotionally and physically all the time. How I never feel safe and how I've lived my whole life as if I'm always in danger. I don't want to identify with it and make it my identity but I kind of have been subconsciously my whole life.Anyway, that's just a brief little ""about me"" for context. As I uncover these little tidbits I find myself realizing how I feel in certain situations and around people in general and how my lack of feeling safe is a barrier to connecting with people. How I have friends and family I love dearly but it's like when we're together there's a wall between us. They don't see it because I cover it up but it's there and it prevents me from feeling connected because I don't feel safe to be myself. Not because of them, just because that's my default way of being. So I've been trying to figure out how I work on this but I often wonder how it might go if I talk about it to my friends and family but it seems scary to do so. What if they don't understand? What if they're hurt? What if it makes things weird and they leave? It's hard to decide if I should take the chance or just work on myself"
autism,Because I'm discovering just how much I was traumatized by my past and it makes complete sense that I'd be afraid of the world and why all the rationality based therapy I've had hasn't worked
autism,"I could really use some advice. I've been in therapy for a long time. I'm almost 29 and I've seen 3 different therapists over the past 12 years. My first therapist treated me for OCD, depression, and anxiety and it helped a lot but it didn't get me to a place where I felt even close to mentally whole or healthy and he said he couldn't help me further so I went to another therapist who diagnosed me with autism spectrum disorder and we did a lot of good work and I made more progress. I'm still not able to function in society though and I'm still not happy or even content. I did, however, discover I have a boatload of trauma and suppressed/repressed memories, emotions, and aspects of my personality. I went to see another therapist for EMDR and we talked about the possibility of a CPTSD, PTSD, OCPD, or BPD diagnosis. She said I'd probably meet the criteria for at least one, if not all, of those but that a diagnosis wouldn't really change my treatment and would just waste my time. I didn't really click with her so I went back to my previous therapist.The reason I'm posting is because it's still not working. As I read more about trauma I'm realizing just how my whole life is affected by it. Things I'd never noticed or had words for. How my body feels like it's on fire when I'm triggered. How I have vast reserves of pain and rage held deep inside me. How I just shut it all off a lot of the time. How I don't have a single person I'm truly connected to because it's not safe and I just shut down and fake how I feel I should act. My therapist wants to work with me but I don't know if he can. I don't know if anyone can. I just shut down. Some things I just can't talk about but I know they're the things I need to. Even when I do though I'm so disconnected it's like I'm talking about someone else. When I'm like that I don't feel like I'm making the necessary connection with my therapist or really absorbing the feedback I'm getting. So I'm looking for advice on things I can try to feel safer so I can connect more or really just anything him and I could try to help me or I could try with another therapist. Because right now it just feels like I'm a lost cause and can't be helped."
autism,"I'm posting here in the hopes that someone shares my experience, or something similar, and can offer me some guidance. I've suffered from mental illness my whole life. I don't even know if this is the right place to post because I don't truly know what I have. I've been diagnosed with or suspected depression, anxiety, OCD, autism, CPTSD, BPD, codependency, and OCPD. All I know is I've tried so hard for the past 12 years to get better, I've tried 3 therapists, over a dozen medications, self-help books, spiritual teachings, yoga, and meditation, but I'm still stuck. Don't get me wrong, I've made a lot of progress but I'm still not able to function at the level necessary to be a productive and independent adult. Sure, I'm not stuck in my house because I'm so terrified of people that I can't go out. My whole days aren't scheduled down to the very minute to the point where if anything is out of place I lose my shit. I don't have to spend 20 minutes every day brushing my teeth because I'm counting how much I brush each tooth. But I have precious little self-esteem. I know my worth but I don't feel it. I'm terrified of being alone but I can't be myself with anyone because it's not safe. A day with a friend leaves me physically and mentally in shambles I'm so exhausted. My relationships fall apart because I pick the wrong people and try so hard to please them that I lose myself. I can't work because I can't adapt to changes and the social side overwhelms me or I can't focus. I shut down or lash out. I feel empty and hollow and disconnected. I feel fractured, like I'm not whole, like I'm constantly torn in different directions and I don't know who I am. Over the course of my life I've turned to food, video games, and now relationships to cope with the deep pain and shame of who I am and what I've become. I know why I'm like this. The years of therapy have uncovered how an emotionally absent father who was harsh and critical and an overprotective mother who never let me do anything for myself set me up to not believe in myself. It taught me how the fact that they were amazingly supportive until I stepped out of the box of who they thought I should be has given me an anxious attachment style that makes it feel impossible to trust anyone. How both of their overly judgemental and critical attitudes taught me to be that way towards both myself and others and leads me to be constantly dissapointed by the world around me when it doesn't live up to my expectations. I feel like I very thoroughly know the why. I just can't seem to make the change. There's some force inside of me that's too great. I say force because the typical anxiety description isn't quite accurate. I have that pit in my stomach, the shortness of breath, the shakiness, of anxiety sometimes but it's just this overwhelming feeling that I CANNOT do whatever it is that I need to do at the time. Then when I'm in the situation I can't get out of the flight or fight instinct and I think that's why everything is exhausting. Because everything feels like danger. Like life or death even.I need help and the CBT and DBT I've been doing isn't working. I haven't wanted to say that out loud for years. There's so much that I've never said out loud. I trust my therapist of 6 years more than anyone but that's saying very little. I've never felt like I really had a relationship with him. There's too much I'm afraid and ashamed to say. I'm afraid of my shadow, as Jung would say. Even just thinking about finding help somewhere else twists me up. I have the fractured parts of myself saying ""maybe I just need a new perspective, maybe it's not him"" ""it's definitely him, CBT is horrible, he doesn't know what he's talking about and you need someone else"" and ""you can't see someone else, no one else is safe and you can't lose him and not have anyone to talk to"". He thinks it's because I'm stuck living with my parents at the moment. He thinks the toxic environment is keeping me from getting better and he might be right. But I can't get out without a job and I can't work or even drive most places until I do. I need to get at least somewhat better before I can leave. This whole thing is a roundabout way of asking if anyone has experienced CBT, DBT and medication not working and what has worked? I've looked into a lot of different types of therapy and I'm leaning towards Jungian therapy but I don't know. I also apologize if I don't respond to comments. Even that can be too exhausting."
autism,"I have treatment resistant depression and I'm doing a treatment that basically puts you in a sedated, dissociative, altered state of mind. I've found that it makes the brain more receptive to new ideas and thoughts during the 45 minutes when it's at it's strongest. I find it difficult to direct my own thoughts in that state but I found listening to a video about letting go of your lonely core self really helped. Ideally I'd have my therapist in there with me but since that's not possible I'm wondering if anyone can suggest a good YouTube channel or podcast or something that is just like positive and healing affirmations? Something to kind of guide my thoughts in a positive direction."
autism,"I could use some support with something that's really hard for me. Honestly I hate posting in these subs. No one knows me well here just by the nature of social media and I often feel misunderstood. I'd be happy to never post here again. I feel like I have to though. I don't feel like I can talk to my friends, despite the fact that they really are some of the most understanding people I know for the most part. Even if they don't understand they always listen and never dismiss me or make me feel bad about what I'm talking about. They definitely know me better than anyone here. But I feel like I can't believe them when they tell me good things about myself. Like I broke up with my best friend and I can't believe them when they say what happened wasn't my fault, my friend was in the wrong, I deserve better etc. They're my friends, they're supposed to say that stuff. Same thing with my therapist. He's paid to build me up. So I turn here because a strangers validation is more valuable because it's not biased. But they also can't possibly understand where I'm coming from because they don't know me or even the situation. They get like two paragraphs to comprehend who I am and that's obviously not enough. It's really hard because I feel so alone and helpless. Like no one can help me or support me. Like even making this post is probably useless."
autism,"This is going to be a bit of a rant / does anyone else post and a little bit of unsolicited advice, which I find ironic because it's I rant about unsolicited advice. Does anyone else just absolutely hate when you ask for advice or help about something and someone gives you advice that's not actually an answer to the question you asked? I'm not talking here specifically (although it has happened here) but in general on the internet. It's frustrating because it's not easy to ask sometimes and I have a really hard time understanding why people can't just Answer. The. Question. Instead of trying to tell me what to do with this that and all the other aspects of my life and health.So the second part is the advice. Don't engage. Don't try to explain to them better unless they've expressed curiosity or interest in better understanding what you're looking for. It's not worth the effort and will only lead to more frustration. It's not your responsibility to make them understand so they can maybe hopefully help you. If they've willfully ignored your question about how many reps you should do of a certain exercise to educate you about the benefits of going vegan (just one example of what's happened to me) they have zero interest in helping you in the way you want. It's about them. For whatever reason they want to help you their way, if they even really care about helping at all, and they're just not worth it. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."
autism,"I don't really know where to post this so if anyone has better ideas I'm open to suggestions but I just need to get it out and get some reassurance or comfort or something. This is me: https://imgur.com/a/cLfHaLG I'm just really struggling with the fact that I'm not conventionally attractive and no one I'm actually attracted to wants me. I feel horribly shallow for saying that because I'm not the type of guy to just be a attracted to people who are conventionally attractive, I find such a wide variety of shapes, sizes and colors attractive, I just have always been rejected by or not even noticed by people I find attractive and I feel like I just can't be with someone I find attractive. It's not even that I think I don't deserve it because I think everyone does. It's just that I feel like I'm not, nor will I ever be, good enough to have that and it hurts so much and I don't know how to cope with it."
autism,"I've had depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation for pretty much my whole adult life and one thing I've found is I just can't stand pity and hearing ""I'm sorry"". Even though I know it's how you express sympathy it's just not what I need to hear and it means practically nothing to me. I feel harsh saying that because you know I'm not a harsh person. I've always been a kind and understanding person but I'm getting to the point where I've lived with this for so long and I've lived without the support I need for so long that this is where I'm at. The good news is I know what I need. Maybe not what I need to get out of this hole I'm in (still working on that in therapy) but I know what kind of support I need. The bad news? I'm not getting it and I don't know how to ask you for it. What I really need from my you is love. I need to be hit over the head with it because it just won't stick in my brain. I just need to know that you care, love me, need me, would miss me if I was gone etc. I need to know what makes me worth something because I feel so worthless. I need to know what are my good qualities? What do you like about me? Because it hit pretty hard in therapy recently when I was asked what I like about myself and I had nothing that wasn't tainted with negative thoughts. Even things I like have negative aspects attached to them and that's all I can think about. I know I need to do the work in therapy but I need help too. I can't do it alone. I just don't know how to ask you for it."
autism,"I'm to the point where I can't watch movies that have relationships in them or listen to love songs anymore. Just the idea gives me anxiety. I think it's because over the past year and a half so much of my core beliefs about love and relationships have been laid bare. I'll admit that even with everything I've learned I still want someone to come along and be everything I've ever wanted and meet all of my needs and for it to fix everything. It has in the past... Until it didn't. I know better now but I can't help longing for it. So when I see love in media it hurts because most of the time that's how love is depicted. There's talk of completeness and wholeness and happily ever after and it's hard because I know that doesn't exist and I kind of feel like I'm part of an unfortunate group of enlightened people who have come to that realization. Like most people don't get it. They have such a romanticized view of relationships, like I used to. Whats even more difficult is it sure does seem like it works out for a lot of them. It seems like they find their missing piece, their person who makes them whole, their happiness, and I wonder why I can't have that? Why my road seems destined to be so lonely as I search for those things within myself. Anyway, just some late night ramblings from my entirely too awake brain. I hope everyone is having a good night"
autism,"I keep doing this thing where I ""fall for"" people I just want to be friends with. Like I don't WANT these thoughts about being more than friends but they won't stop. It's not even like I'm resisting falling for a friend. I legitimately don't want it but my head won't leave me alone and it's so hard and confusing because I get caught up and start thinking maybe I DO want it and I'm just fooling myself. Like logically I don't see us as being more than friends and we don't click like that but my head doesn't care. It's also worse when I'm feeling worse mentally. I have really bad depression and BPD too and if those are bad the intrusive thoughts are so much worse. I feel like I'm going crazy sometimes. Can anyone relate or am I just out of my mind and overthinking?"
autism,"I've been thinking a lot lately about what love is and means to me and it's a very confusing subject. Love isn't as cut and dried to me as I feel like it is for most people. It's riddled confusion, trauma responses, need and attachment. Or rather I think I mistake those things for love but I don't know. I recently met someone online who I hit it off with and it was a unique opportunity to really look at ""that"" feeling. That feeling where you feel like you've known them your whole life, where they just hit the spot in ways you can't explain, where you're smiling like an idiot, where you NEED more of them, where you end up drowning without them, where you want to do anything and everything to please them, where you lose you in them. I identified it pretty quick and I realized I love it but I don't like it. It's frantic and scary and unsafe. It feels just as awful as it feels amazing. It feels similar to what I always thought love was supposed to feel like but horribly twisted. I immediately wanted to run away at that realization. Music is my passion and I always think about music when I think about love. I think about how that feeling seems like it's what a lot of love songs are about and it makes me wonder if I've been tricked by people who write about the feeling I'm experiencing and call it love when it's not. What I'm really trying to figure out right now is whether or not love is something I've experienced but it's so mixed up with other things that it gets tainted and I ruin it or if what I'm experiencing isn't love at all but rather need and attachment and love is something calmer and safer. Because I just keep thinking to myself ""next time I feel this it'll work out. Next I'll take what I've learned and it'll be different. Next time it will be with the right person and it'll be everything I always dreamed of"" but that dream is always a nightmare and I'm to the point where that's what I see when I feel that feeling. I just see a nightmare waiting to happen and I'm wondering if I'm not alone in feeling that way? Because I just feel like I don't know what love is or is supposed to be like and I feel like I'm doomed to forever repeat this cycle of pain and hurt and I feel like I'm the only one."
autism,"My therapist is on vacation this week and I could really use some help with something that's bothering me. It's kind of long but please bear with me. I have a best friend I trauma bonded with who I've posted about here a lot. I was convinced I was in love with her at one point and separating that fantasy from the real person (who I definitely care about and like but don't love) has been really hard. I'm getting there though and I'm proud of myself for that and I've been able to be open with her about my BPD and all the complicated feelings that come with it and she's been so nice and understanding. Anyway, I'm struggling because we don't talk like we used to and it hurts. We'll be in the middle of a conversation and she'll just not message me for days. It makes me really sad and hurt and I feel like I'm not important and not good enough for her. It's exacerbated by the fact that I think she has a boyfriend now. I don't really know because relationships are a trigger for me, especially when it comes to someone I'm close to. I just feel so not good enough when I hear someone I care about talking about being in a relationship. I feel like they have what I'm not good enough for and I feel like I will always be second best to their significant other. I feel like they won't need me anymore and I won't be important and they'll leave. Just the mere mention of the person might cause me to have a dissociative episode if it catches me off guard or in a bad place. I've had to set boundaries with people about talking about relationships so I can ease into feeling safe doing it.I'm definitely not there with this friend. I'm still in the very early stages. But it really hurts that we don't talk like we used to and I want to tell her that but I'm afraid it's because she has a boyfriend and I'm afraid I'm being replaced and abandoned and I don't know how to safely talk about it. I don't know how to say that I feel this way and I'm afraid I'm being replaced and abandoned while also saying I can't hear all the details right now. Like I know as the best friend I'm probably not going to take priority but I also don't want to feel like I'm being neglected. I don't mind sharing as long as I still feel like I'm important and I don't right now. I'm afraid she'll think I'm jealous too. Which I am, but not because I want to be with her anymore. I just want to be and feel like her best friend again. It probably doesn't even have anything to do with everything I'm thinking. She has a new job and she's working crazy hours and it's the holidays and she's really overwhelmed. She's even said a few times since October how much she misses when we used to talk all day every day. But I guess I just feel like I need the reassurance. I need to hear her say I'm not being replaced or abandoned and that I'm still important. I even know she'll give it to me if I ask, she's always gladly told me whatever I need to hear. I just don't know how to ask."
autism," I feel like no one understands my friendship needs. I've tried for a long time to make friends and I've gotten really good at playing the social game but it's become problematic. I'm overwhelmed, exhausted, drained and so deeply hurt. I got so good at making people like me that I'm surrounded by people who like me but who I don't feel safe or comfortable with. People who don't get me or who barely talk to me. People who are superficial who claim to care about me but rarely, if ever, show it. And no one but my therapist understands why I can't just be ok with that. Why I'm not ok having a bunch of acquaintances. Why just having them as ""friends"", even if they don't talk to me much, takes up my headspace and energy. I've been feeling like I just want to run away or go back in time and start over. But I do have some good friends. Some people who get me at least a little. Who make me laugh and smile and who I have fun with. Everyone else I just have no use for and I just want out of my life and my head. I don't want to talk to them or see them on social media or in my contacts. It hurts too much and drains me. I feel like a horrible person for being like this though. For not being normal. My therapist keeps saying I just gotta do what's right for me and we've been working on a list of people to keep and get rid of but I don't want to hurt anyone. I just wish I could be normal. "
autism,"I really struggle with loving myself. Mostly because of things I can't control. First off I'm disabled and chronically ill and I hate my body. I have acne, I'm overweight, I've lost a lot of hair, it's not fun but I'm doing everything I can on that front. I also have a lot of trauma and mental health issues that I'm also working my ass off on. I'm not looking for advice on those things, I know I'm on the right path, it just takes a lot of time. What I'm looking for are books on learning to love and accept either those things or myself in general. Something positive I can read every night before I go to bed that will hopefully help me shift my thinking."
autism,"Does anyone else feel like you can't be yourself around your friends or they won't or don't accept you because of how often you have problems or extra difficulties with things? Like I've been doing an exercise recently that's been really helpful where I write down my thoughts without editing them and mostly I'm writing down stuff that I've wanted to say but haven't been able to. The whole idea is that I have a hard time being myself with people, not constantly editing everything so that everyone likes me and no one will leave. But I know once I start getting good at writing it I'm going to actually have to put it into practice and there are going to be some things that I have to bring up to people and finally come out and say and I don't know if I can do it all at once, especially with people I have a lot to say to. I've done something similar in the past but mostly it was me telling people I'm upset or there's something I want that I'm not getting that I want them to change and none of this is stuff that I want anyone to change anything about but theird stuff I have to say and I just feel like people already get tired of me having to tell them XYZ thing upset me or is bothering me or I need something different from them and I just worry about people getting tired of me just not being normal I guess. Tired of me having so many struggles that I want to talk to them about or revelations about myself that involved my interactions with them. I don't know I guess this is just the fear of abandonment again because I don't feel like anybody wants someone who's not normal or who's so far from normal like me."
autism,"I really struggle with my body image and it's really bad lately and I don't know what to do about it. I just feel so ugly and hideous and out of place in this body. It doesn't feel like mine and I hate it. My body is just as broken as my mind is. I try and try to change it but nothing helps. I've got chronic fatigue to the point where I can barely move some days, brain fog that makes simple conversations hard to keep track of, acne that hurts and itches, I'm fat because I can't workout because I'm so tired, I've lost a bunch of my hair from all the meds they've tried for my mind and body. I've gone to doctor after doctor and no one can help me, it just gets worse and worse. It's just broken and I hate it and I don't want it anymore and I think ""who could ever possibly love such a hideous and broken thing?"""
autism,"I've been thinking a lot lately about getting a new therapist. I've been with my current one for five and a half years but I started going to him before I even had any clue that what I experience is In any way related to trauma and he's not trauma informed. I went to him for autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and just kept seeing him afterward. Over the years I've realized more and more how much the trauma affects me more than the fact that I have autism. It's not my autistic behaviors that are the problem it's how I feel about myself because of the trauma of being rejected, abandoned, ridiculed, and overall just not accepted for who I am. I was never able to take my mask off for my previous therapist, I didn't even know I was wearing one, and I haven't really been able to do it with this one either. I don't know if the problem is me or if it's him. I don't know if it's that who could be expected to know who I am and what's going on in my head when I hide it so well or if as my therapist it's his job to figure that out but either way it's just not working. I go in there and I can calmly tell him just what depths of despair I've been in but has never seen any indication of how bad it really is. I've never broken down or gotten emotional or irrrational or frustrated, even though I've felt all those things. It's just really hard after almost a dozen years of doing therapy to think about starting over again with someone else I don't know. I don't know if it's the right decision either. I don't know if I shouldn't just tell him what I'm writing here and try to work through it or if I just need to move on."
autism,"It's really ironic that clear and honest communication is one of the things I value most yet something I struggle with greatly myself. I just always feel like I'm so different from people and they won't understand when I talk about how I feel. For example, it was really hard for me when someone I'm close friends with got into a relationship because at one point I wanted that with her (nowadays she's firmly just a friend) and I worried I wouldn't be important anymore but I never said a single word to her about it or about how much I appreciate that she showed through her actions that our friendship wasn't going to change. I can't tell another friend how much she means to me as a friend, that I've never been closer to anyone else, that all I want is friends with her and I know that's all she wants too yet there are things that I don't feel like are ""normal"" friend things that I feel towards her like the fact that I miss her when she doesn't text me and want to just say ""hey, I miss you and I hope you're having a good day"" or that sometimes I just hug her or cuddle so I hold them inside. When I'm in a relationship I hold things in because I think it's weird to talk about my self-awareness and how it affects how I feel and the relationship and my needs. I just... I'm not ""normal"", I never have been, and I'm ashamed of it and so afraid of showing it and being rejected for it. I just want to let it out and talk about things so badly. I want to be free. I just want someone to tell me it's ok to be me."
autism,"I'm in a really bad place lately. Worse than usual. I'm suicidal on a regular basis and I don't know how much longer I can hold on. My whole life is falling apart. I haven't spoken to my best friend in over a month. She kept disappearing and barely speaking to me and almost three weeks ago I told her that I couldn't take it anymore and, even though it would break my heart, I couldn't be friends with her anymore if she couldn't just talk to me. I haven't heard from her since. I feel differently now. I know there's nothing wrong with what I said or how I felt at the time but right now I just want her in my life again. Or even just to know that someday we'll be friends again. I'm afraid to tell her how bad things are though. I don't want her to feel manipulated. Especially because part of me hopes how bad things are will make her want to talk to me. I have two messages written to send to her. One just says how much I care about her and miss her and that I'll be here whenever she's ready to talk. The other is all that plus how bad I'm doing and that I'll be here as long as I can hold on for. I'm just so confused, torn and conflicted about what to send. I don't know what the right thing to say is and I don't know what I want to say. I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm just so lost."
autism,"I'm coming to accept something really hard. I'm having to accept that people show me a fake ""best"" version of themselves to get me to like them. That most people do it. That they don't even do it consciously or maliciously most of the time but it's hurtful because I end up loving that person they show me, whether it's platonically or romantically, and it breaks my heart. I'm not like that. Sure, I'm not my true self at first with people, but all the lovable awesome things about me don't go away. My lovingness, affection and attention don't go away. I don't know how to protect myself from this without just shutting down all the good things about me. I can't keep doing this though. I can't keep loving a fake version someone shows me, and being utterly devastated when it's gone. I don't know what to do."
autism,"It's been awhile since I posted about my best friend here. We haven't spoken in three weeks now and I really don't know why. I could go on and on about the details of everything that's happened real last 6 months with me and her but I'm coming to realize that those details are kind of irrelevant because, according to her, we're fine and she hurt me anyway so that makes sense. Some people may know what happened from my previous posts but that's the only relevant detail: she lied to me about something and hurt me pretty badly but we had made up in the middle of June and were working on rebuilding the trust between us until the beginning of July when she started just disappearing on me for days or weeks at a time. She just said she was overwhelmed and couldn't bring herself to reach out the first time it happened and she was afraid I'd be mad. I sympathized, told her I loved her and understood but it still hurts when she just disappears. So fast forward to now and it still hurts and I don't trust her. She disappeared to avoid confessing her lie to me back in May so I'm having a very hard time trusting that it has nothing to do with me. And, regardless of whether it does or not, it's just not the kind of friendship I want. I'm not the kind of person who has friends like that where we just don't talk and we catch up like nothing happened and she's known this about me from the beginning, both by me directly telling her and by my actions in that I always talked to her every day and made the effort to see her regularly. So I'm at the point where I'm trying to decide whether it's a friendship I want anymore. Not even whether I want it, because I do want it, I genuine and deeply care about her, but it's causing me a lot of stress and it's not good for me. At least not in its current state. So what I'm getting at in a roundabout sort of way is that I need to talk with her because the bottom line is that it's just not working for me. It's not even that I have a specific expectation of exactly how it should be, it's just not working for me and I feel we need to find a better way so it works for both of us or I need to move on. I mean ideally we'd go back to talking on and off from the time we woke up to when we fell asleep but I get that's not probably going to happen. Even if it's just some reassurance that this isn't it, it's not the way things will always be, or something that's going to happen often. Or if she needs me to reach out and double text because I'll admit, I religiously do not double text if someone disappears mid conversation. I don't know what the answer is. I just know that the answer isn't just things being the way they have for the past two months. If it is then my answer is we just won't be best friends ever again. I won't just cut her out but I can't keep hoping she'll be someone I can be close to and trust and rely on nor will I put much effort into a friendship with someone who is not those things. I'm at the point in my life where I want a small and close circle. I'd like her to be part of it and she always said she wanted that too. She always said I needed someone who would stick around that I could count on, that she liked being my light and vice versa, that she loved me and would always be there. We both promised those things. I don't WANT to believe that she just isn't or can't be those things. I don't WANT to believe she's not the friend I thought she was. But right now I'm stuck with her not showing she is, for whatever reason, and I'm at the point where I need to either accept the present and let the past be memories or move forward in a different way. Because right now I can't let go of the way things were and I can't move on. I'm in a state of limbo waiting for a sign that things are going to change and I just can't do it anymore. It's too painful holding on to those memories and hoping. It's time to move forward or move on.What I'm hoping for by making this post here is advice on how to communicate this. How to say this without making her feel bad, because I know she will, I know she thinks she's not good enough for good things and people, I know she beats herself up and I don't want her to feel like I'm reinforcing that. I also know it's not her fault I am the way I am. To a decent degree it's me. It's not that she's a problem, it's just that the way things are don't work for me and that's really not anyone's ""fault"". It's just how it is and if we wants to continue being best friends and being close we've got to find some kind of happy medium."
autism,"So I'm going to try to phrase this post a little differently in the hopes that I'll get a different response than normal. Hell, if I don't maybe I'll get good practice in doing what I'm struggling with. I'm looking for validation that it's ok to do something and some help with how to do it. I have a very hard time expressing when something is not helpful. I have a lot of trauma, treatment resistant depression and have been suicidal a lot lately. I don't like reaching out to support groups when it's really bad because you all don't really know me so how could you possibly help? And it's not liking I'm building a relationship with the people who are commenting like I would with friends and family. But I rarely do reach out to them because when they're not helpful I don't know what to say. What I normally do is just say thanks because I know they're trying to help, but they really aren't. Sometimes what they say just makes it worse. But I feel bad saying it's not helping. I feel like they will feel bad and I myself feel bad because I feel like not being able to be helped is a personal failing. It just confirms how hopeless and helpless and worthless I am. I don't know how to express something is not helpful or that something else would be more helpful without making the person feel like what they're doing is wrong or like they aren't good enough. But if send someone a paragraph about what I'm struggling with and get ""I get that"" one more time I feel like I'm going to lose my mind 😅"
autism,What do you say to someone when they tell you it gets better but you know that's not true? When you've been doing this your entire adult life and it never has. Because I don't think I can stomach just saying thank you one more time. Like I appreciate the intent and I don't want to see him impolite or ungrateful but when I truly just don't believe that it ever will get better because it never has I just can't stand hearing someone say it and I can't stand thanking them for it. Maybe that makes me a bad person. I don't know. Probably. Good people deserve more than this.
autism,"I've tried a lot of things over the years. CBT, DBT, over a dozen meds, TMS and now I'm doing ketamine. Nothing has really worked enough. Sure, I've made progress, but it hasn't made me feel safe again. Even if I'm happy I'm never safe. I know it's trauma. I've read about inner child work and it produces an intense inner pain and deep sadness in me. A strong desire to just be held and be safe. This is what drives me. I seek safety from somewhere. Relationships, friendships, therapy, music, hobbies, food, I'm sure there's more I'm missing. I don't need coping skills to distract myself (I have endless distractions), I don't need new thoughts to replace the negative ones (I can use self talk, the negatives just never back down), I don't need drugs to fix my brain, I need to heal this trauma. I need to feel safe. I just don't know how. I know how someone else can make me feel safe and there is value in that. I just don't subscribe to the common belief that ONLY I can or should provide that safety and having the right people in my life is important. But I do need to find some way to heal this poor child that's so hurt inside me. To give him some safety. I just really truly don't know how to do that in a way that will work for me. How have you heal from the  trauma?"
autism,"I feel like I have no hope for anything anymore. I've been battling depression for 15 years, mental illness and trauma has eaten my entire adult life. Just when I started to finally come out and make some progress I got hit with chronic illness. No doctors have been able to help me. I have brain fog and chronic fatigue to the point where some days I can't function, small tasks become insurmountable. I can't lose weight and I'm too tired to exercise more than a walk everyday. My face is covered in hideous acne that no one can seem to get to go away. All the various meds have taken a good portion of my hair. All the trauma from never being understood and having all my friends, family and significantly otherd leave or use and abuse me has made it almost impossible for me to trust anyone and I can't seem to find anyone worth trusting anyway. Everyone just hurts me and leaves. I'm not good enough for anyone. I can't work, I don't enjoy anything, I don't feel anything but pain and hurt in every conceivable way. I have done therapy, I've done doctors, I've done meds, I've had my brain zapped with magnetic waves, I've done psychedelic new treatments and nothing is working. No doctor or therapist can fix me. I'm broken and ugly and there's no hope for me. The thing is I don't want someone to help me. I don't want someone to fix me. I just want someone to make me believe that I'm ok the way I am. That, even with all of this horrible stuff that has stolen my life from me, I deserve to be happy and loved and that it's possible. Because I just don't think it is. I don't think anyone will ever love me or want me the way I need and I don't see any point in going on with a life like this."
autism,"I just wanted to make a little discussion post about love bombing and see what people's thoughts are. I know it's used as a very negative term and most people view it as manipulation and something that people with BPD and other personality disorders do to control people but I just wanted to share my experience. For me I love bomb when I feel intense positive emotions about someone I feel very connected with and attached to. When I was younger it was my sister. As I got older and formed friendships and romantic relationships I did it with them too. It's not always the most fun experience. It's overwhelming. I just have to get the feeling out because I'm so overwhelmed at how good this person is making me feel. I just want to hug them and tell them how much I love them over and over.  How much I love this feeling I get with them, even though it's overwhelming. I won't lie, I want that back from them but it's more about just getting it out than trying to make them feel attached to me in the same way. Stifling it makes me feel like I'm dying. It's not a manipulation. It's a reaction to extremely intense emotions that I have no control over. I'm curious how others experience this and what people think about my experience."
autism,"I've been thinking a lot about my triggers and trauma a relationships and how they all fit together lately. Especially in regards to my best friend (FP). Relationships 100% are a trigger. I really want a healthy one and it hurts that I don't have one. But it also hurts because I want someone to save me. I want that romantic fantasy where someone comes into my life and makes everything ok and happy because I feel so broken and bad about myself. That fantasy is everywhere. All over social media, TV, books, movies, songs, you name it, triggers are everywhere. Unrealistic beauty standards don't help either, especially considering one of the things I feel worst about is my appearance.This brings me to my friend. I won't go over the whole story but I thought I wanted a relationship with her but she didn't and told me so and that it wasn't me, she just didn't want one at all, only to end up in one not too long after. All relationships hurt and trigger me but she is by far the worst. Just hearing she's happy because of it triggers me and it's frustrating because I love her and want her to be happy. But I just go back to the night she broke the news to me after practically cutting off contact for two weeks every time. I was so upset leading up to it because I felt like she was abandoning me and finding out why, because she didn't want to tell me, just broke my sense of self and self worth into a million pieces for weeks. I go down this rabbit hole of trauma because that night I was so devastated because that feeling brought me back to all the times in childhood I felt like my whole self was rejected.I doubt myself and overthink so much though. I wonder if I'm just creating the trauma story to hide from the fact that I'm in love with her and I can't be with her. But at the same time I'm really not. I do love her but I really don't want to be with her. I guess I'm just looking for some validation that this makes sense. That a triggered moment can in an of itself because part of the trauma. Any suggestions for what to do about are greatly appreciated too."
autism,"How do you deal with triggers? My biggest trigger is anything to do with relationships. Songs, movies, TV, Facebook posts, seeing happy couples while I'm out, anything that has to do with people being happy in a relationship. The worst is seeing my friends in relationship, especially female friends. The closer the friend, the harder it is. It triggers my self loathing, I feel ugly, worthless, pathetic, needy, broken, my self fragments and I'm consumed by pain. I wonder ""why was I not good enough for them?"" I analyze their partner, finding every flaw I have that they don't and annihilating myself over it. It's ruining my relationship with my best friend and it's putting a strain on other close friendships. It keeps me from even trying to be friends with people who are in relationships. How do I cope? Because I just want to leave. I want to run away from anyone and anything involving relationships until I find one. Music is my passion but I can't listen to or play so much music because of this. Should I just expose myself to it to develop a resilience to this pain? Because I avoid so much. I avoid even thinking about it. I just want to move past this. "
autism,My journey has lead me from OCD to autism to codependency and now BPD. Therapy is always helpful but it's one hour a week and that's not enough to stay grounded and keep making progress for me. I've found YouTube videos to be immensely helpful so I'm wondering if anyone can recommend any good channels that deal with coping and healing from BPD?
autism,"I had a very good therapy and I have a plan to work on myself and work on strengthening my sense of self. Unfortunately I didn't have time to talk about my favorite person in therapy today so here I am looking for advice again #sorrynotsorry lol. I'm aware of that the very nature of a favorite person relationship isn't healthy. I want to change that with my favorite person. It's really hard though and I won't lie, I'm afraid it's not possible. It's really hard when someone is so linked to your trauma. Like she is everything I needed that I didn't get growing up. She takes care of me like I never was by my parents. Before I assigned her the role of caregiver in my subconscious mind I loved her for it. I still do. But it got twisted and warped into need. I messed up and told her I wanted more than friends. Then... She hurt me.She had told me she just didn't want a relationship, that I was the best person for her but she really didn't want to go there because she's bad in relationships, she pushes good people away. I really fell into needing her after that. Until she met someone she wants to possibly date and blew me off for two weeks because she was afraid to tell me. It hurt like hell. All the rejection trauma from my childhood hit me like I freight train and I didn't know that's what it was. It just hurt. I stopped talking to her for two weeks it hurt so bad. Fast forward to now and we've made up. My BPD diagnosis and discovery of what a favorite person is helped me make sense of how I feel, especially now that I'm journaling about my trauma and discovering it's the same pain. There's a lot of work left to do on our relationship though. A lot of trust to be rebuilt. A lot of difficult questions I still have. She knows she's my favorite person and what that is but she doesn't know the why that I've explained here and I feel the need to tell her. I also know we need to talk about boundaries and concerns. She said she loves me and I say it often now but I worry I'm crossing a boundary. I want to just hug her and cuddle platonically with her and I don't know if that's ok. I need to find other comfort but I still want her to be comfort for me. I liken it to what parents are supposed to be like. You lean on them but they're not your everything, your sole source of comfort. She's said she wants to be whatever I need but we haven't talked about what all that is because I'm too afraid. Because I want to express my concerns about her not having time for me or this guy not being ok with the way our relationship is. But that involves thinking about the stuff that triggers me. About being abandoned, replaced, rejected, feeling not good enough in so many ways compared to him. It's a really dark place that I'm afraid of going into but I know if it's even possible to make her just my really close and special friend rather than my favorite person it's going to take a lot of communication, boundary setting and patience from both of us. I'm just scared of the hurt that I know I have to face to get there. I don't really know what I want from this post. Advice from someone who's been there maybe? Reassurance that I can do this? That it is possible. It's just hard. It's just really hard."
autism,"It's been a long road to get here and it's going to be a long road to get where I need to be. I've been posting a lot about my favorite person lately (you know, in case no one noticed lol) but I've been pretty lucid since I finally journaled about my childhood trauma today. I won't go into specifics to avoid triggering anyone but I realized the pain I feel when I have a favorite person, especially one who doesn't want me romantically, as is the case right now, is the exact same pain from my childhood abuse. I always said I cry a certain way for my favorite person and that's how I was crying today when I tapped into that pain. I have autism and my dad never understand why I needed different things and acted out when I couldn't get those needs met so he punished me emotionally for it when I was really just as confused as he was and needed him to hug me and tell me it's ok. I always wanted my favorite person to love me and take care of me the way my dad never did. They tend to be people who give me a lot affection, like my dad did, but then when they don't want me romantically I'm drowning in feeling not good enough for a variety of reasons, all of which were given to me by him and reinforced by society. I feel this disconnect that tears me apart. How could they say all these things and not want me? What's wrong with me? Why can't they love me? It's the same disconnect I felt as a kid when he would tell me I can do anything, that I'm amazing and special, yet he didn't want me unless I was perfect and lived up to that.So now I come to my current favorite person. She doesn't want me romantically but she is the most kind and loving friend I could ever ask for.  She's been so patient with me since I discovered I have BPD and told her that she's my favorite person. I truly do love her. Before she was my favorite person I wanted her to be happy no matter what, whether it was reciprocated or not, and that's what love should be like. Not the need and obsession that I felt when I assigned her the role of caregiver in my mind. A role which, ironically, she's actually willing to take on and has just in being my friend. She loves hugging me and she's said even if I break down it would be ok because she'd be happy she was with me. But for me it wasn't enough unless she wanted me all the way, even though I didn't even really want her that way from the time we first met in person. I just idealized her online self. So going forward I know I can't completely rely on her but I really do want her in my life, even though I know it's going to be hard. I know I'm not going to always be lucid like this. I'm going to get triggered and I'm going to get lost in my trauma again. One session of journaling isn't going to fix this. But what I'd really like from this post is some tips on making a favorite person relationship work, especially when they're not your significant other, and maybe some success stories. Because I know when my trauma comes knocking again I'm going feel like it's never going to get better. Like I will always be miserable if I'm close to her. Like I need to leave or suffer forever. And I truly don't know what to do when I'm like that. I try to hold it in and not reach out to her but it hurts so bad. It feels like I'm faking being secure when I'm dying inside."
autism,"This is an interesting one. I have treatment resistant depression and a whole slew of other issues (GAD, OCD, autism spectrum disorder and probably BPD) and the only thing that seems to break through my numbness, pain and anhedonia is being in a relationship. I've been on over a dozen meds, tried therapy and TMS and it helps the behaviors but not the depression. So I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this and if you know what happens in the brain in a relationship and if there's a treatment that replicates this? Because I feel like whatever neurotransmitter is being released in a relationship is the key to fighting my depression."
autism,"I'm so lost inside my head today. I know my way forward is being my own favorite person and finding some way to love myself and integrate this trauma but today I can't and I just want someone to help me make sense of things. I know my relationship with my favorite person is unhealthy and I know I need to work on that too but I just feel so not good enough for her because of what happened between us. She made me feel like I was good enough. She loved everything about me. I made her laugh and smile so big. We had endless loops of silliness and happiness. We have so much in common that we joke that we have the same brain. We have cute nicknames for each other. When we first met it was like we'd known each other for years. She wanted to know every little thing about me and I wanted the same. Every message we sent was filled with cute smiley faces. She said I was the silliest, funniest, sweetest person she'd ever met. She said she loved my hugs and they were the best, I was the best. I was cute and adorable. Even if things got sad we could both take each other's negative and turn it positive without invalidating. She told me that even I broke down and cried in front of her she'd hug me and still be happy because she was with me. I had a different favorite person when I met her and it allowed me to love her without being attached. I do love her. I just transferred that attachment unwillingly when my last favorite person left. I do want her to be happy no matter what but... I just can't deal with the fact that, after all the the things she said to me, she chose someone else. How can I be good enough if she chose someone else? There has to be a reason. I was everything she always said she wanted but she didn't pick me so there has to be something wrong with me. It has to be because I'm ugly or too needy or that I can't work or do a lot of things because of all the issues I have. It has to be something. Something has to be not good enough about me.She herself has told me it's not because I'm not good enough. But I haven't had the guts to say everything I've said here because I'm afraid of the answer. The one thing that gives me comfort is messed up. This guy has hurt her three times and she's only known him a month. One of those times I wasn't speaking to her and all she wanted was me because she said I'm the only one who knows every part of her and hasn't hurt her. But she didn't want to message me because she didn't think she deserves to be in my life. I know she doesn't think she deserves good things so she pushes them away because she thinks she fucks up every good thing that comes into her life. That's why she told me she didn't want to be with me. I try to hold on to maybe it's not me, maybe I'm good enough, maybe I'm actually TOO good and that scares her and triggers her own issues. But I don't know that for sure and I'm too afraid to talk to her about it."
autism,"What has helped you heal the most? My biggest problem is relationships. As in my whole self and happiness is based around other people. I've been in therapy for 10+ years, read countless books and articles and watched so many YouTube videos. Some things help but I just can't love certain parts of myself or stop looking for someone to love them for me. I want to. I just haven't been able to. I'm hoping this BPD diagnosis and the resources associated with that knowledge will finally help me find something that works for me."
autism,"Is having a favorite person worth it? It's so hard but so good too. When it's good I feel safe and loved and almost normal. I can enjoy things that my depression normally steals from me. But when it's bad I can't breathe, I'm drowning, I'm not good enough, I'm abandoned, nothing feels like it will ever be right again. It's like my mood flys around from zero to ten all the time. But when I don't have a favorite person I'm just surviving around a 4 with occasional dips back to 0 or up to 7 or so. I'm never close to normal but I am much more stable. Does it get better? Can I have a healthy friendship with my favorite person where I don't dip into the depths of despair? Where I just feel safe at least most of the time? I love her so much but it's so hard. Right now I feel like I'm in a lose lose situation and I don't know what to do. I know I could just leave and it would break the attachment but it would hurt and I'd just end up attached to someone else eventually."
autism,"I'm really struggling with the recent realization that I have BPD. I've heard so much about how we can't love and be loved and I worry because I've always felt that way. Like no one could love me with how much I need and like I don't know what love is because I always just get attached. They become my favorite person and I idealize them. I want someone to love me. Anyone. And when they do I turn them into the best thing that's ever happened to me, even if they're not what I want. I just want to love and be loved like a normal person. I don't want it to hurt so much."
autism,"I really need some help with my perception of reality with my favorite person right now. She's been off the grid all day and I'm getting really anxious and losing my grip, my stability, I'm drowning in my insecurities. Lately I have two distinct states and I don't know which is reality.When I'm good I'm sooooo good. This state isn't always when I'm getting her attention but it is more often than not. Sometimes I'm able to self soothe myself into this state. In this state I'm whole, safe, content. I love myself and I love my favorite person and that's all I need. I'm not in love with her, she's just my person and that feels right to say. Girlfriend doesn't sound right but my person or even my soulmate does. I know she loves me and she needs me. I want her to be happy no matter what, even if I'm not always the one to do it. I don't need a relationship with anyone to be whole and I don't really want one with her. She doesn't have some qualities I really value in a relationship and I want the full package. Sexual intimacy doesn't feel right with her in this state either. It's like thinking about kissing your sister. I just think of her hugging me and holding me and I feel safe and loved and it's enough, I'm enough. I can keep going forward in my life and healing and maybe someday find someone to fall in love with.When I'm bad though? It's hell. I'm dissociating. I'm lost in a sea of turbulent emotion with no way out. I think about her with someone else and I feel my soul shattering, my heart tearing apart. I'm assaulted with graphic sexual images of her with someone else. I feel abandoned, replaced, neglected, not good enough, worthless. I wonder if she's with him and I think of how much better he must be than me for her to want him like she doesn't want me. I feel ugly and disgusting. I loathe myself. I feel like she deserves so much more. I feel empty and broken. Like this pain will never stop. I wonder if I am in love with her and my entire other state is just designed to protect me from this pain of being rejected by this person I love so much.I just doubt so much what is real. Am I really in love with her or not? Is this what love is supposed to be like? I don't know what's real but it hurts like hell."
autism,"I'm beginning to wonder if I can ever have a happy and healthy relationship. Whenever I get close to someone and they get close to me and say things that make me feel good they become my favorite person. I've had two ex's and two unrequited ""loves"" and they were all my favorite person. I idealized them. They had qualities I really loved and I filled in the rest with fantasies. Eventually, by either my actions or theirs, they've all fallen apart except for this last one. She's an unrequited ""love"". She's my best friend. She's my safety and comfort. She's my everything. But she's also my trigger. When she's gone I'm abandoned, I'm not good enough, I'm ugly and broken. Even when she's here I'm trying to prove I'm good enough, that I deserve the fact that she accepts and loves every part of me. I want to be her everything. I want to be her favorite person. But I'm not and in reality she's not my everything either. She's not perfect. She suppresses her emotions, she doesn't make me laugh when we're together, she's almost painfully quiet sometimes, she's a lot of things I want but she's not some big things too. I want someone who makes me laugh and can talk to me for hours who is also everything she is. But she's still my favorite person. I have her way up on that pedestal. I want to be her everything. I don't want to be replaced. She's seeing someone and he might end up being her boyfriend or husband someday. It hurts so bad to write that. He's going to be more important than me someday, or someone is, and that feels unbearable. I don't know if I can do this. I feel like I'm suffocating and drownings without her. I think ""maybe I should just leave and move on"" ""maybe I should find someone who feels the same way about me"". But I had that with my ex's and it still wasn't enough. No matter how many times they said they weren't leaving I still felt all those triggers. So I think ""what's the point in leaving? This is just going to keep happening. It's never going to be enough."" As long as I have a favorite person I'm going to feel this way. I won't truly be able to be happy. I just don't know how to do this. I don't want to lose another person because I idealized them and couldn't handle it. I just don't know how to stop."
autism,"Over the weekend I made up with my favorite person who mislead me about not wanting a relationship and then practically abandoned me for two weeks because she was afraid to tell me she met someone else. She said she knows how much she fucked up and hurt me and how sorry she was and how she's worried about me and missed me every day. That I was her best friend and her person she shared everything with and she loves me and needs me. I didn't expect her to say she loves me but I really needed to hear it. Yesterday I felt so good. For so long I felt like I needed a relationship to fill this hole inside of me but between starting to validate myself and hearing all that from her I didn't feel that need anymore. I felt like I just needed love from within and without and I finally found it. Like it wasn't a relationship I needed, I needed to be loved.Today has been hard though. Those pesky thoughts are back ""why was I not good enough for her?"" ""She found someone better and she's going to leave"" ""she deserves someone who isn't damaged and broken"". I know the reality is that she's not right for me. We're really close but she doesn't make me laugh and the idea of anything physical other than hugs just doesn't feel right. Calling her my girlfriend wouldn't feel right. But I love her so much and I just want her to need me and to be her favorite person too. She said she needs me. I screenshot it so I won't forget but it's still hard. I've questioned if maybe I just made all this up to justify having her in my life. Maybe I really am in love with her and I can't let her go and I'm just creating this story to cover that pain. I don't think that's the case but my emotions are so unstable I don't know what's real and what's not. I need help. I don't know what to do."
autism,"I made a long post about her last night. I'm not in love with her but I thought I was and she lead me to believe there might be a chance for almost two months before practically abandoning me for two weeks just to tell me she found someone else. That was two weeks ago and we haven't spoken since. I told her I needed time. A week ago yesterday she messaged me and said she still cares about me and always will. I didn't respond. I've wanted to. I only planned on taking a few days, even though I didn't tell her that. I have so much to say to her and I want to give her the chance to make things right and explain to me why she lied to me about not wanting a relationship. But I haven't been able to. I've accepted that she's just my favorite person and I'm not in love with her. Hell, she's missing some important qualities I want in a relationship and the thought of kissing her or sleeping with her doesn't feel right. But the idea of her doing that with someone else? That's pure agony. I keep replaying things she said about him and feeling so inadequate, so ugly and not good. Like he must be so much better than me if she wants him in those ways and not me. I don't want to feel this way. I just don't know how to cope."
autism,"I just feel like I'm going crazy and I don't know what to do. I met this girl online in November and we immediately clicked. We talked all day every day. I'd wake up to her good morning and fall asleep talking to her. I called her silly girl and she said it made her smile every time and she called me goofy boy and I smiled too. If I had a dollar for every time we said ""saaaaame"" in response to each other I'd be rich. We'd joke that we shared a brain. Every message we sent was filled with cute smiley faces. We learned everything about each other. We talked about the fun things we'd do together. We shared our passion for music. She said I was amazing and the best and the funniest, sweetest, silliest person she ever met. I liked her from the beginning but I was getting over some heartbreak and I wasn't ready for more.We met in person in January and I was... Immensely disappointed. She was so quiet and there was so much awkward silence. She didn't seem to want to get to know me. She wasn't as attractive in person either. We still talked through text though and kept getting closer there. We would hang out too but it was the same every time. She was like a different person. I shared more and more of my trauma with her and she accepted everything. My need for reassurance, my trust issues, my weird quirks and routines. She unrelentingly accepted everything and any time I'd say something bad about myself she'd turn it into a positive without making feel invalidated.I started to really have feelings for her at the beginning of March after a conversation about dating where she said she was thinking about trying. I realized I was jealous. I was all the things she described wanting and I wanted to be that for her. I struggled to keep it together for a few weeks because I was still confused about how different she was in person but near the end of March I told her how I felt. She told me that she thought I was probably better than anyone else for her but she wasn't ready for a relationship, that she was enjoying being single after getting out of a six year relationship last year, finding herself and making friends. She also said she pushes people away in relationships and she didn't want to do that to me. It was extremely hard for me. I became more attached but I respected her wishes. We kept getting closer and she kept reassuring me it wasn't because I wasn't good enough, because that's how I felt.Almost 4 weeks ago she stopped talking to me very much and started blowing me off about hanging out. After a week of that I asked what was wrong. She said she was just busy and not really into her phone much. A week later she confessed that wasn't it. She had met someone who she wanted to date and she pulled away from me because she was afraid to tell me. She said it was like something out of the movies and she couldn't explain it. We haven't talked since.I feel like I was never good enough for her. I feel like she never cared about me. I feel used. I feel like I'm not amazing. I feel like she found someone who really is the best, someone who's sweeter, funnier and sillier than me, someone more attractive, someone less broken. I feel she's someone else's silly girl, like I'm not her goofy boy anymore. Like she never really accepted me. Like she never loved me. But I DON'T LOVE HER. Not like that. I think she's amazing and so much fun to talk to and so cute but I DON'T LOVE HER. SO WHY DOES THIS HURT SO MUCH? Why can't I stop thinking about her with someone else?! Why won't my mind stop assaulting me with graphic images of what she might be doing with this guy?! Why can't I stop FEELING SO MUCH. She reached out on Friday to say she still cares and there are so many things I want to say to her but I can't because I still want her... But I don't. If she told me tomorrow she wanted me I wouldn't go for it. I DON'T LOVE HER. But it doesn't make sense and it HURTS. I just want my friend back. I want my safe person. I don't want to feel this way. She's not the one for me. I keep saying it over and over again because I can't get my brain to stop thinking it. I don't know what to do. I just don't know what to do because I'm in so much agony. Everyone tells me to love myself and work on myself but I'm TRYING. I'm trying so hard and I'm making progress. I don't want to hear that because I've heard it and I'm in therapy and doing everything I can. But it doesn't take the feelings away and that's what I want. I just don't want to feel this anymore because it's not love. It's twisted and it HURTS. I just want someone to understand 😭😭😭"
autism,"I want to start off by saying that I don't know if I have BPD or not but I'm in so much pain and I have some of the symptoms and I remember my ex who had BPD felt this way too.

autism,"I'm 27 and I've had treatment resistant depression for 10 years now. I also have anxiety, OCD and autism spectrum disorder. I've tried 15+ medications, various natural remedies, CBT, DBT and TMS and I'm getting ready to try Spravato soon. Sometimes my depression will lessen (on two of the meds) but for the most part my life has been a black hole. The one and only thing that seems to bring me out of depression is being in a relationship. That dopamine rush when I feel loved is really the only thing that breaks through in any way shape or form. I don't understand why and it's frustrating to no end because I don't want to rely on anyone for my happiness and it creates unhealthy relationships, hence my current single status for almost a year. Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope? It's so hard when the one thing that feels like a cure is mostly out of your control . I also wonder if this is any indication of what is actually wrong with my brain and what might actually finally help?"
autism,"I have both autism and OCD and my biggest issue is my routine and this feeling like if I don't do certain things that keep me calm and sane I'll get overwhelmed and burnt out or like lose my mind or something. So like if I'm not able to play video games, watch YouTube, listen to music or watch TV for a certain amount of time (I don't know the exact number but it's many hours) I get upset and anxious and overwhelmed.  It's keeping me from having the life I want to. I want to work and live independently and have a social life so bad it hurts but I just can't seem to get over this. I see a therapist and it used to be much worse, these days I can adapt for certain occasions if I have advance notice whereas before I absolutely could not and I used to have a lot more traditional OCD symptoms (counting, hand washing, keeping certain objects straight or symmetrical etc.), but the thing is that taking baby steps is the only thing I've found that works and I don't know how to do that here. I feel like I could slowly start not doing this stuff all day but then what do I do with myself? Then whatever I do end up doing just ends up becoming a routine I'm stuck in again. But there's no way I can see to just ease into working and I really feel like I can't handle just jumping into a job. I just feel worthless and pathetic all the time. I don't even enjoy this stuff but I *have* to do it. I feel like there's no way out and no one understands me at all. Hell, I don't even understand me"
bipolar,"Hey all. I'v noticed a complete change of how the hospital treats me before and after my diagnosis of bipolar. Before they listen and acknowledge what I said now they are completely invalidating.  I know it says bipolar on my chart, it seems like they just think Im ""crazy"" and don't believe me. Its horrible."
bipolar,So I'v been taking 300mg of gabapentin once a day for 1 month..5mg Klonopin twice a week5mg Clozapine also twice a weekBut which of these would cause sexual dysfunction if Im taken them so little like this?
bipolar,I'v just been 6 days on Clozapine and am getting off. I need to take Vicodin for tooth and dont want to mix them.How long after I stop taking Clozapine can I feel the effects of another drug like that?
bipolar,"Years ago I took Choline and it made me feel bad, almost manic.Sunflower Lecithin contains Phosphatidyl Choline and I was wondering if anyone knew if it was bad for bipolar?Iv also read that Sunflower Lecithin is good for treating people with Bipolar disorder."
bipolar,"Hello everyone. I'm coming off an Antipsychotic (remaining on mood stabilizer) and am experiencing Hypersexuality.  Its the state I was at before, where I can't think about anything but sex. Things feel so much better now I don't want this to be a reason to put me on Latuda again. I have so much more sexual energy pent up and theres nothing I can do.  Perhaps others have experience and was looking for others thoughts, thanks!"
bipolar,I had no intentions of being on Latuda and have gotten off but I insisted my psych APRN look into eating 350 calories with it. I knew people needed this and she was incorrect and only did it to help others not to prove her wrong. Its a very small thing but think of all the patients she had and now will benefit. Hammer those docs with questions!
bipolar,Hello all bipolar fellow folks. Im trying to figure out if Lamicatal (Lamotrigine) is causing problems with libido. My Psych aprn says it doesnt cause sexual side effects.  I was wondering what other peoples experience was with this med.
bipolar,"My psych APRN is discussing Lithium with me and says only some of her patents have issue with sexual function being on it. I was wondering if any other bipolar folks had issues with this medication with this. Id really appreciate peoples input, thanks!"
bipolar,"Some of the only two things left in life that give me pleasure are now lost do to antipsychotics (latuda). I feel like Im not justified going off them because my interest in these things is of lesser importance. Weed can pull me out of a deep depression and makes me do things. I frightens me that my reproductive system doesnt work, I feel broken.Im going off latuda and need to talk to it with my psych aprn but am worried she will not agree."
bipolar,Im on Latuda and Lamotrigine and get kinda paranoid when smoking weed. Does anyone know if antipsychotics effect weed smoking?
bipolar,I'm trying to figure out if Antipsychotics are making me loose the ability to feel pleasure.  Does anyone else find anything like this at all?
bipolar,"Hey there everyone, Im on Latuda and was wondering what side effects folks are experiencing."
bipolar,Im on Latuda and have notice problems with sexual function. Has anyone else experienced this?Does anyone happen to know which Antipsychotics effect reproductive system the least?
bipolar,I'v recently switched to Olanzapin and am generally liking it. I seem to be hungry more often however. I run so that helps but I'v heard weight gain is an issue. I was wondering what folks on this medication thought of it.
bipolar,"Im Bipolar and and in a depressive phase. Its really hard to find motivation to do anything. Im just staring at the wall. So bored, but reading a book or something seems so hard to sit still. Does anyone else experience this? Know of way to combat boredom?  I can't even figure out where to begin."
bipolar,i'm asking this because i haven't been manic/hypomanic  for 8 months and i've been on high doses of antidepressants. but i was diagnosed with bipolar last december and the doctors said i had psychosis. is t possible i'm still recovering from that episode that's why i haven't been happy since ? idk it's been so long it feels like i just have major depression . if ssrris aren't helping my depression what would be the next step?
bipolar,"so first i tried prozac which is probably the only anti depressant to work consistently when i was 14-17 . but it stopped working and i fell back into horrible depression and social anxiety . so i tried zoloft it only worked for a few weeks which has left me traumatised seeing how happy i could be then it slipping through my fingers and never returning. then effexor didn't do anything , then i tried lexapro and that did nothing , then i tried paxil and that kinda worked but mmm not really . still hated myself . i tried zoloft again and still nothing :/ . is there something wrong with my brain like badly ? so i stopped the meds for a week and tried lsd . it barely had any effects . like i seen barely any visuals and just felt  weird. i had 450 ug and my friend friend t and it worked for her . could my serotonin receptors be non existent or something or not work ? i just wanna be happy .i'm only 19 and i feel like an old lady . i work out often even though it's been getting hard to keep up with it lately :/ i feel like everyone around me laughs with their friends and can have fun like a normal person and i'm stuck in a cage and watching everyone at a party i wasn't invited to. i'm so alone and i feel like i just don't matter. i suffered abuse as a child but i don't remember it so idk if therapy would help plus i don't open up to anyone . i'm not someone who's ever really done drugs but i'm considering it . a temporary high sometimes is better then constant emptiness in my option . thanks"
bipolar,"i'm so alone no wants to hang out with me anymore i've turned into a severely depressed dull person . i don't really remember who i am anymore . i haven't been myself for like 2 years except for manias .prozac was a godsend before it pooped out . nothings worked since just made me manic (zoloft) then severely depressed afterwards for monthhhhhs . i don't even have myself . i want to bash the shit out of myself because i'm so worthless and i fucking hate myself . i miss being someone . will i ever return to my old happy self when i was on prozac . i'm training myself to kill myself . choking myself with cords so i can not be so scared to hang myself eventually . i'm serious i can't do this for much longer . i've tried so fucking hard . got a job , exercise , go shopping . changed meds . tried effexor lexapro and paxil . none of them made me better really . i'm back on zoloft but also paxil coz it helps with anxiety atleast thankfully . i took 40 mg of prozac too . i forgot , i'm switching back to prozac . it's been 9 months since i stopped it . my dream is for it to work again :( i'm thankful for this community online i don't feel as alone as i did . sorry for the long post but i'm also  on weed alcohol and lyrica so much k kinda weird er"

bipolar,what do you take for anxiety ?
bipolar,might suggest it to my psychiatrist. i was on abilify but stopped and haven't been on anything for bipolar since
bipolar,"i'm so miserable , my last manic episode was about 7 weeks ago . today my boyfriend broke up with me and i love him so much . i feel so unlovable . im so alone but i don't wanna be around anyone in my pathetic sad state . would lyrica help ? i'm on effexor and zoloft but they aren't working yet . yes together because i'm tapering off zoloft . i want to escape my sad sad life . i feel like the only hope to ever being happy is mania . i'm only 18 and my mental health is so horrible . i hate my brain . i should be out living my life but instead i spend my days staring at my phone and crying . i want a job but i feel like i'll just fail at it . i've got nothing to live for seriously . i know mania is dangerous but depression is ruining my life . my boyfriend got tired of me and i'm wasting away . i've tried exercising ( everyday) . it helps a bit . all i've got is my sister now ."
bipolar,or since bipolar causes a chemical imbalance would all the benefits from the snri stop ? hope this makes sense
bipolar,i don't take mood stabilisers. my last manic depression episode was 2 months ago . does this mean i'm not gonna go manic ?
bipolar,or do you need a mood stabiliser to feel any happiness ?
bipolar,it's the only time i enjoy life . i don't even know who i am when i'm not manic . i feel empty and numb . i met my boyfriend when i was manic and he fell in love and now i'm not that fun passionate funny person anymore i can tell he wants to leave me . i miss manic me so much . i truly believe i'm an amazing person when i'm manic . why can't i be like that all the time . is it possible to be happy long term when you're bipolar ? i'm only 18 as well . i'm considering just becoming a druggo so at least then i'm someone
bipolar,would anti depressants do this ?
bipolar,it's the only time i've felt so happy and truely myself . if i take two ssrris will i be manic ?? or is there any other ways . i've been depressed for a month now so lazy tired anti social and boring . i want to enjoy life again even if it's only for a couple of weeks
bipolar,so over this depression
bipolar,will any mood stabiliser actually help me ? i'm sick of being so depressed . i don't even shower or eat anymore . i've been so distant with everyone . i can't hold a conversation anymore all i can think about it suicide . would ritalin help ? i miss manic me . when i'm manic i'm fun and outgoing and loving and energetic. when i'm depressed i'm so closed off and nothing . i don't want a medication that just gets rid of mania . the depression is what affects me most . i don't know what to do anymore . abilify is just making me a depressed zombie . what's the best mood stabiliser.
bipolar,i was put on the wrong meds . wondering how long until i go back to normal and stop feeling like a numb depressed zombie ? anyone else has this horrible feeling on abilify . the first few weeks i had loads of energy now i have none . i need to be on a mood stabiliser not an anti psych . will this feeling go away when the abilify wares off ? :(
bipolar,does anyone take ritalin with their bipolar medication to help ? with the lows
bipolar,i'm scared to take my pills anyone got any experience with them ?
bipolar,i'm coming off abilify wanna know what to look out for
bipolar,i'm on 10 mg have been for a few weeks and the last week i've felt unbearably tired . i can't see a doctor until like 2 weeks . i can't be this tired 24/7 i think i need to half my dose
bipolar,i'm so so tired all the time i need like 12 hours of sleep every night then i'm still tired during the day :( . it's making me depressed . i've been on it for a month and i wanna stop taking my meds fuck this . it makes me feel like a zombie .

depression,"My cousin doesnt reply to my messages (i dont know why, i havent done anything), my mom doesnt care about me, and the self help group i went to (which was the only place i ever felt fully accepted) doesnt exist anymore. And my eating disorder is getting bad again. This all happened in two days, before that i was kind of doing well."
depression,"I just had to i couldnt sleep, i cried all day and nothing helped. I wanted to make it to 6 months :/"
depression,Next goal is 3 months
depression,"I was very happy this summer and i think i recovered from depression. Last semester i was bullied every single day and i self harmed every time i got home from school. I also dont have any friends, i was anxious all the time even at home, i couldnt ever relax and my grades were quite bad too. There was a few weeks when i was crying all day, even in class, i just couldnt stop it. I never felt this bad my entire life. This summer i changed a lot, i got rid of all my unnecessary negative thoughts, i felt a lot better, and im 2 months clean from self harm now. I just really hope that i can continue this while in school."
depression,They will see my scars for the first time. I hope they won't say anything or stare 😬
none,"I'm in the midst of another health obsession, all because of a lab that is normal, but not *normal enough* for me. Anyway, I got a piece of paper, and wrote down EVERYTHING I've ever been convinced I had. Everything from the mundane and easy to fix, to the rare and deadly. The list is so long, and very diverse, many of them normal” people would have to google because of the rarity. The thing is, I haven't had any of them, except a couple UTIs here and there.  My list is laughable, and seeing it written down helped me realize that, and also realize all the days I've wasted worrying about them all.  I'm a nurse, I also thought about what I would say to a friend or patient that brought me this list as their own possible conditions. It didn't cure me, but it sure as hell helped today, and it will probably help in the future if I can just hold onto this knowledge. I thought if it would bring someone else a few minutes of peace it was worth the share."
none,Hi!  Im a 23 yr old female. I'm curious to know whats some good pure d8 with ya know some💨 to it. I have tried Alien and a couple others. Enlighten me. Im on alien strawana rn
none,"Hi! I suffered for 6 months with T! Im sure alot of you remember me. I want to update you guys. I have been good. I dont think I have T anymore or maybe I've gotten used to it? I want to remind everyone to stay strong. Its hard Ik. Try to sleep with the tv on, turn to get headphones and listen to white noise(at a good volume!), try to cut down on caffeine and nicotine! And remember you are never alone in this. You arent crazy. Comment below if you need some help"
none,"So. Its been over 2 months since a ER visit. I still struggle with the panic from time to time. The intrusive thoughts, The odd sensations. But I want everyone to know who is struggling right this second. It gets easier. You may not get normal completely but you will learn to cope. It will become easier. Never give up ✨"
none,So hi! Last night i was hold my cat rubbing my face against her and I went to sleep. This morning I woke up and my face feels swollen and numb on that side. Its bothering me so badly right now because I seen a triggering tiktoc last week. No fever or anything. I took a shower and put lotion on but health anxiety has me panicking so bad.
none,"Yo. I gotta say. I was busting my dailies out and this random person un defensive rode up. I immediately got shook. Im level 197 and this random dude invited me to run his shit. If your seeing this dude, Mf keep up the good work. Not everyones toxic in this game"

I've hd tinnitus,this weird crackling popping in my throat,full body muscle cramps,flushing in my face, stiff neck, feeling my pulse in the center of my chest, my eyes are always bloodshot and i swear they look yellow, just alot of stuff. Have had plenty of images done,tests,ENT and everything under the moon and sun but I cant accept I'm fine  I swear somethings wrong with my neck horribly. I went from hearing the sizzling to feeling it and honestly its causing massive depression and fighting between me and my bf because i nonstop video game to help distract myselfConstantly have fears now of bad stuff. And its hard to not"
none,"Y'all having issues? I have had a horrid time this AM. From odd trains,to bounties not working,freezing in place, invisible members of posse, random floating wagons and stuff in Saint Denis, just pure chaos. Anyone else having issues?"
none,"I'm a 23 year old female. Im 5'3, 186lbs, and pretty inactive due to kids and mental health. I have panic disorder and ocd really badly. I'm healthy other than lupus. I have a bad,embarrassing habit... it involves pooping snd began from not being able to poop and became as way to cope from my horrible anxiety and get away from people. And my kids for a little bit. I tend to use the bathroom and push like i have to poop everytime. I'm trying so hard to break the habit as I'm extremely self conscious that it has made me looser in my intimate areas. A year later I'm terrified I've messed my body up. I have bad tinnitus(ENT doctor said everything is fine) pulsing feelings(back legs shoulders. Just everywhere) and a array of things. I broke down to my GP and told her of my habit and fears. She told me I would be fine but avoids the topic when Im stressed about it. Im so scared i may have a aneurysm from the constant straining I do. Has anyone else had a habit like this?"
none,"So for the past 5 months. I've had tinnitus, hissing/ ringing in my jaw,neck area. I went to the ENT. All was good. I do have anxiety and clench my jaws alot. Also have had a few times my jaw has sorta gotten out of place. My ears also get pain in them. Anyone else have this? Or anything similar? Whats so Stretching i can do? What steps should I take?"
none,"A week or so ago, I went to the ENT. Everything was fine. No scarring on my drum, no fluid, no anything. But my T persists. When I swallow my ears pop. ENT said he thinks TMJ and muscle tension is cause. I am a very anxious person by nature (Battling panic disorder, depression etc) and I do clench down alot. But my question is could tmj really cause the clicking and stuff I hear? Any help would be appreciated"
none,Im a healthy 23 year old. 180 pounds. I take zoloft and Gabapentin. For the past few months I've had neck fizzling. It started as a sound. The eventually I hear everyday nonstop. My muscles constantly spasm mainly on my left side and its so distressing. My doctor wont order any imaging. I went to another ER and had a CT of my head and cerical thoracic done. All came back fine. My blood tests have came back well. No high cholesterol or anything. I cry alot because I don't feel taken seriously. I dont know what to do anymore. Could it just be muscle tension?
none,"23 years old, 181 lbs, 5'4, healthy other than lupus and white matter found on front temporal lobe of mri, testing was performed but nothing alarming other than some markers for lyme. My medications are 100 mgs of zolot, 600 of Gabapentin, 4 mgs of tizanadine, and allergy pill Zyrtec. I began having tinnitus in February. I constantly begged my doctor for a referral after 3 month of ringing. She said you have scarring and fluid in your tympanic membrane . I went to ENT came back fine no hearing loss, or scarring (okay... why did my doctor say scarring? Great another reason to cause distrust) I have noticed my neck and head pulses and i think maybe my bad posture ( trying to correct it) is causing it. Maybe its bad tension?  My neck also clicks and hisses and its just so distressing. My PCP wont look into my neck she just says,” its your anxiety or neck Crepitus” The only other thing concerning me is the shoulder, and leg spasms and pulsing only on my left side. This just started about a month ago. Thankfully i have my neurologist appointment soon and hopefully she can help me figure it out. It makes it so hard to sleep. Anyway if your still here please help me get some pointers for this."
none,"Question. As a sufferer for 6 months, I have no answers for my T. ENT cane back fine. I have noticed my neck and head pulses and i think maybe my bad posture ( trying to correct it) is causing it. Maybe its bad tension? The only other thing concerning me is the shoulder, and leg spasms and pulsing only on my left side. Thankfully i have my neurologist appointment soon and hopefully she can help me figure it out."
none,"Turns out. Nothings wrong ENT said hearing is perfect, no scarring, No fluid. So idk how to feel. Im depressed because I was so hoping it was something treatable"
none,"My appointments today and I'm so nervous. It all started in January. A bad cold. And then ringing only in left ear. During those months, I have had silence for maybe a week. My T has been bad in my left ear. Then moved to my right. Its like my pulse a constant ringing and clicking at times. Always goes away for a few days then comes back. Gnarly migraines and muscle spasms all down my left side I feel like. Matches my whoosing. I have even had a audible cracking/ popping that my fiance heard laying next to me. The ringing goes from one side to the other and goes away sometimes then back within mins. I've even had such discomfort I've felt my outer ear and swore its moved in sync. I get the spasms down my back, arms, and legs only on my left side. I also suffer from Health anxiety badly and surprisingly I'm very proud of myself for not running to the ER again for 3 weeks. It's honestly been so exhausting and I'm terrified they aren't going to take me seriously. I'm so nervous but excited for some answers today.  Any advice for a fellow T sufferer to bring up and not forget?"
none,"I recently decided to go CG! I bought a diffuser,denman brush, and shampoos and stuff. I got OGx hair oil and serum, Hask mist, I also got herbal essences rose shampoo for the clarification stuff. I got a silk bonnet, and funally some Maui. Am I making good steps? 😅 Give a fellow curly gal some tips?"
none,7 days left until ENT appointment. For some strange reason my tinnitus has went down. I barely even notice it now. It was tough. So tough tbh. Its still there granted. But one of two things. Its going away or its becoming habitual. I just want to remind everyone. It eventually will become normal. I know its hard. It's been 5 months for me but Stay positive. Distract yourself. Listen to brown noise
none,Okay short summary. I've have fluid behind my ear drum and scarring of my tympanic membrane for like 4 months now. So today. Im eating a cough drop and can feel the coldness in my ear like what??? Anyway. This is questions for you guys 🤣 Another question if you guys made it passed that. For chronic ear problem bros. Did your ears make any sounds when they cleared
none,Had a video appointment with my GP. Im 13 days away from my ENT appointment and my tinnitus been giving me some strange symptoms. Then again I do have health anxiety. But man the tension headaches are awful. The ring in my ears thats like pulsing static is so awful. They got from one side to the other along with odd blbbly sounds thst sound like its all around my neck. I also keep having popping in my thoughts that I can feel. Like up in my nasopharyngeal. I've had fluid in both ears for about 4 months with scarred tympanic membranes. My ringing always sounds like it coming from my neck 🤷🏻‍♀️ Anyone else have this? I also made the plan to stop all caffeine to see if that helps a bit. And limit nicotine. Hopefully it does. It's honestly so hard. Anyway thank you for reading my ted talk 😊 hopefully my ent will find out the cause and i can get over thisUpdate: My ears are still ringing but not as loud. My right ear is losing some yellowish stuff. I showed my doctor and am waiting a call back now. My left is still ringing to but not as loud
none,"I had a painful traumatic experience about 3 years ago. I never exactly explained it to my GP. But today, I decided to break my wall down to her. I explained everything and after months of her giving me the cold shoulder. She actually understood. I'm so happy. So relieved"
none,"Hi! Im a 23 year old female. Im healthy other than lupus. Im 5'2 185. And my simple question is would a CT without contrast show a anurysm in your neck? I've had 2 cts of my head, one of my cervical thoracic. And one abdominal with contrast. Also had a mri in 2019. I have a phobia of anurysms due to severe constapation. I was very stooped up and pushed to poop alot everyday multiple times a day for months. Turns out I was eating something i was allergic too. Now i have ringing in my ears which my personal doctor said was fluid behind my ear drums alot with some scarring. I have a ent appointment soon but I fear i have something sinister wrong with my neck even tho CT said everything was perfectly aligned. Down below is a copy and paste of said results EXAMINATION: CT SPINE CERV THORAC WO CONT HISTORY: fall.   TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of cervical spine was performed in the axial plane.Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were created and reviewed.

IMPRESSIONNo CT evidence of acute fracture or traumatic subluxation."
none,Its so hard right now idk how much longer I can do this 😭😭😭😭 I dont wanna post my symptoms because I dont wanna get ky post taken down before anyone sees it. But I really need someone right now to help me calm
none,So here i am. 4 months into tinnitus. And its bothering me so bad. The fears run through my head like crazy. I feel this odd bubbling in my throat towards my sinuses. Awful headaches now that cause me to focus more on ky pulse due to the pulsing in the back of my head. I have bad health anxiety. Not going to lie I do. I constantly think what if the Tinnitus is something serious? I cant tell the difference between pulsitive tinnitus or if my ear is just super imflammed. My doctor said I have fluid in my inner ear along with scarred drum. Im so anxious tonight I can hardly stand it. I dont know what to do.
none,Just a question for the Tinnitus people. I have fluid in both my ears and frequently hearing the ringing the the back of my head. I'm just curious as to where you hear yours!
none,"My tinnitus has been ongoing for months. I have fluid behind both my ears along with scarred membranes. I swear I can hear and feel the pulsing all over my body.:( I also have this clicking in my ear when I lay down. Headaches just eh. It's horrible Hard to cope with honestly. Had lipids done,  thyroid done, rainbow, ct and no answers yet"
none,I don't understand it. I have it in both ears. When I lay on my side it moves to the other and stuff. My GP said my tympanic membranes are scarred and retracted. They have been for months with fluid. I finished my ear drops today and still no improvement. My ENT appointment is in a few weeks amd Im honestly so nervous about it.
none,So I started in February with ear ringing in my left. It then moved to my right. And now instead of ringing it's sorta a odd hissing in my ears. Along with this odd taste and popping in my mouth. My tinnitus has went down alot and after pushing my doctor for CT of my head and neck nothing was found. Then sounds like its always in the back of my head and when I first get up it isn't there but as the day progresses boom. There it is. Its so stressing
none,I had a good couple days. Hit the gym for two days and then. Just all of a sudden my tinnitus came back full throttle :( and my anxiety along with it. I had a ct of my head neck and thorax. Had my lipid checked. Had my thyroid checked. All came back good except the fluid behind my ear and some scarring of my ear drum. But i can feel and hear my heart beat again. Its such a hard night :(
none,Went to my doctor today. I have fluid behind both my eardrums my eardrums are scarred too I hate this. It's honestly hell. None stop swishing heartbeat almost. I'm so tired constantly. My doctor did a CT without contrast tho I really wish she would have. I'm so stressed out. Had my lipids ran and thyroid ran. She checked me for bruit. I'm just so scared. I have my new appointment in a month. My neurologist appointment in 2weeks. :(
none,I missed my ENT appointment due to being at the ER til late and them giving me adivan because I was a very emotional wreck crying about the ringing. The ER doctor looked in my ears and said they were red and gave me some eardrops. I'm hoping my T goes away... Its been months since I've had silence.
none,Well another night in ER. To find out i Have ear infevtion in both ears. Great!
none,"I have my first ENT tomorrow tomorrow and honestly. I dont have my hopes high at all. I get the feeling they are just going to not listen to my concerns. I started having a ringing in my left ear, that eventually went to my right side. My ears pulse alot and i even get chest sensations but after have a head and neck CT, chest xrays, and MRI two years ago. I just get that this is just not going to be taken seriously. I'm going to push tho as I'm a sufferer of health anxiety and this has made my life a living hell. Hopefully they'll listen to me"
none,Todays a loud noise kinda day. I swear I can hear the tension in my shoulders. The sound of my heartbeat even though it isnt sync with my heart. Makes my chest hurt 😞 feeling hopeless I cant sleep because of the sound. I'm excited for my ENT appointment tomorrow. Hopefully i can have a answer.
none,I fell the other day and went to the ER. They did CAT of my neck head and thorax. But im second guessing them... its hard for me to accept nothings wrong with me. The ringing in my ears for months and stuff... any advice?
none,"I am a 23f, Healthy, and got ringing  in my ears. I went to the ER they did a head CT. I'm curious to know if the ct scan could see veins and stuff to my very anxious mind at ease. Here's what ct said : EXAMINATION: CT SPINE CERV THORAC WO CONT HISTORY: fall.

none,"So im on my second day of prendisone and man. I'm so anxious. I can hear my heart beating. I can feel it beating hard. I have it fir bronchitis but lord. These side effects make me not wanna take it anymore. It makes me so anxious and uncomfortable. Sweaty, pounding heart. Any advice?"
none,My tinnitus never starts in the morning... but by this time it does. I had a CT of my head and neck done last night at the ER with a chest X-ray. Found out I have bronchitis. All good but I have health anxiety bad. So as I type this. I'm curled up in bed. My tinnitus started in my left ear. As a slow hiss thats now progressed to a hiss that matches my heart in some way. It pulses from right to left and switches.  But the other day. My left ear isn't as loud now as what it was but my ears feel like they are pulsing. I did have some stuff ears earlier today and just took my antibiotics and prednisone but Im having such a hard time. :( Its so hard. I keep fearing what if its my heart? What if its this or that? I do have a ENT appointment soon. So theres the plus. Just need to vent.
none,I went to two different ERs yesterday for the ringing in my ears. The ringing started in my left. Now its in my right. Seems to match my heartbeat. I dont have it in the mornings. I had head and neck cat scan yesterday along with a chest xray. But still fear something isn't right with my heart. :( I have bronchitis
none,"At the ER because the ringing was maddening. Made me have a mental breakdown. I cried, swore I have a tumor. After a Neck and Head CT, I found everything normal! I have scarring on my left eardrum but not sure whats causing the tinnitus on the right side. Safe to say Im lowkey upset my primary care doctor didn't give me antibiotics for the fluid behind my eardrum months ago. Hopefully the tinnitus goes away. Its been months since I haven't had silence. I cannot wait for my ENT appointment in a few days"
none,I got tinnitus and it pulses. But not with my heartbeat but similar to it. It makes me so anxious it's ridiculous. Never in the morning time but after i been up for awhile. At times I swear it feels like my head pulses with it. Or maybe im hyper focusing. Its making me so anxious i have panic attacks because of it. I have intense health anxiety and man.... it isnt any fun. I heard crackling in it.
none,So my right side has 3 missing important teeth. One molar on the bottom and my two molars on top. Recently I've had tinnitus bad my right side is outta place and I cant find a night guard that comfortable fits due to to the missing teeth. My wisdom tooth on the top has came in but its in the back molar space. Any advice?
none,I'm spiraling bad again... the ringing in my ears is so annoying. I hear it with my heartbeat then Itll change. Sounds like coming from my neck or back of head. My shoulder pulsed earlier. I try to tell mysef with the 2 cts (one of head the other of my belly and pelvis with contrast) that if something was wrong. They would have seen it. I'm fearing this circulation of my blood. My necks been giving me problems along with tense in my head and twitching of my lips. Just so much. I had a good few days. No panic attacks at all. But bam. Past two days. Its been horrible. :(
none,Honestly this makes me very anxious at times. Sometimes my ringing is on sync with my heart. Sometimes it isnt. Sometimes i hear crackling in my neck. I have a appointment on the 28th with ENT. I've had ringing in my ears for months. Honestly I had a strange habit of doing something that causes a rise in BP. We won't talk about it but ofcourse I think omg this worse. Doctor said I have fluid behind my ear 2 months ago. Can fluid really stay behind the ear for two months?
none,"I did good for a fee days no panic attack. I felt proud but then I read something by accident. I got curious how my first ent appointment would go for my ear ringing and neck stuff. So i looked it up and seen something scary. So even tho I had a MRI in 2019, a CT this year and another CT of my belly with contrast. I'm still freaking out. I've been up 23 hours. Everytime I try to sleep my body goes numb and I jolt up. Its hell. I'm so tired physically emotionally and mentally. I wish I wasnt like this. I keep breathing in. Coughing up phlegm finally. Maybe this is a sign im getting better. I used a metipot earlier. It did wonders for my clogged nose. Eh just need someone right now"
none,"I've had tinnitus for 3 months now. My doctor said in February I had fluid behind my ear drum. I've been super anxious about this. Its a constant low grade hissing thats just nonstop. It often has a beat of its own not matching my heartbeat. But I've tried everything. Flonose, etc. never had hearing problems before in my life. I do have a wisdom tooth coming in on the same side but today my hissing has gotten louder. Honestly has me a nervous wreck. I have a ENT appointment on the 25th but just wanna know of any of you have had this before?"
none,I woke up today with a very sore throat. I do have seasonal allergies. I also have a skin picking/ scab issue. Mainly the scabs that form in my head. Ofcourse I checked my throat. Its not red. Not swollen but hurts. My hips hurt. Whole body pain. Then the other day I swore my hand had a rash of some sorta. I had it laying on the middle console of my car and swore it was pale in certain spots. So here i am. Early in the am. Fearing i have Sepsis. So full blown panic. Checking my temperature. Heartrate. Wondering what if? Trying my hardest not to message my doctor with some stuff. Trying not to go to the er. So here I am. Venting and nearly crying.
none,"Hi all. Im a 23 year old female, healthy expect for lupus, I vape also, who was in two car wrecks in 2019. Within the span of a year. I went through some chiropractic care. (She gave no exercises or anything. Just told me to come in. Only did one xray and i felt she didnt do her job. So i no longer went) For the past two months. I've had this strange hissing popping noise when I lay down or even when i walk. I can hear this sound in my ear also when i step. Similar to like sand moving? My fiancé has also heard it when I was laying on him one night. He said,”That sounds like rice cripses”. (i honestly cried when he said he heard it to) It sometimes goes all the way up my head. Along with a constant hiss in my ear. Had my arms go numb a few times. Along with muscle twitches everywhere. I'm not sure what it is but is annoying. My PCP won't order any xrays or anything. She claims it is tinnitus and set me up with a ENT. In 2020, I had a brain MRI and stuff done. Came back all clear except some signal abnormalities which i had a lumbar done and it determined i had some markers for lyme but nothing furthermore was done. (Smh, I do have health anxiety but this is legit) I'm honestly at a lost at what to do further now. I have went to ERs, and a head CT(came back clean), abdominal CT with contrast(clear also) and they all just kinda look at me crazy like they have no idea what to do and that any sort imaging on my neck would be a total sin. I do have a appointment with my neurologist in May but honestly its got me anxious. Should I worry about this or just wait til my neurologist appointment?"

none,I'm panicking. I noticed today in the sun. Big white spots on my hand and regular colored skin when i rested my hand on the middle console. I swore I could feel pain. I'm still feeling pain. My dissociation is hard right now. My body feels numb. I do have fluid in my ears my doctor said. And i have this lump behind my ear. But thats not my concern. Mine is my arm right now. Fearing the absolute worse. The fear has me unable to speak. My whole left side feels weird. I need help grounding.
none,Man. My ears been ringing for weeks. Doctor says i have fluid. Its pulsing but not like my hearbeat and i keel hearing this popping sound in my neck. Can you guys feel your sinuses drain or am i going crazy?
none,"So. I finally am on day 2 of upping my zoloft to 75 milligrams. And lets just say 🙃 I've had better times. I'm overthinking hella,dry throat, weird head feeling, brain zaps, restless and just overall not having a good time. I'm excited though and eager to feel semi normal once my body gets used to this but man. Its hard. Like really hard right now. It was hard when I first got on zoloft. Just like this. After E.R visit after ER visit I know Im healthy and fine but man. The thoughts are strong. The sensations are strong. I was starting to feel okay but made the step that I meed to up again. Words of encouragement from my anxiety suffering friends?"
none,So I went from 50 mgs to 75 and eventually I'll go to 100. I was originally on 200. But had to stop for some months. I keep having these weird sounds outta nowhere. Like popping hissing sounds? Im also kinda restless with large pupils? Is this normal?
none,So for the past month or two. I've had this hissing popping sound in my neck. I've told my doctor and she said its crepitus with no imaging of my neck done. It's honestly got me so stressed out. I keep worrying what if it's something serious and shes not taking me seriously. Could it be muscle tension? It only does it when im laying down. Anyone else ever have this?
none,Hi! Im a 22 year old healthy female with health anxiety. I was in two bad car accidents in 2019. In 2020. I went to a chiropractor. Now 7 months later I have this odd hiss in my neck when I lay down. Numbing headaches and just all around a pain in the HAHAHA neck. I've tried to talk to my doctor about it but shes like you have anxiety. Fluid behind your ear” etc. is it normal for my neck to be making this sound? Or am i just hyper focusing on it?
none,So for the past month I've had ringing in my ear. My doctor said I have fluid behind it but shouldnt it be out by now? My ear wont hold pressure when I try to pop it. Its got like a rhythm of its own. Not in sync with my heart. When I walk i can hear it move. Anyone else having problems with their ears? What's some tips?
none,"I just want to vent about my anxiety. After a dozen tests my anxiety has moved to a new area. My ear has fluid behind it my doctor told me over a month ago. and i can constantly hear it. The low tone hissing and ringing. With a beat of its own. I'm so sick of anxiety. My neck makes this weird sand moving sound. I went to the chiropractor about 5 months back and decided to stop going and now i fear that like. My necks messed up. What if i have to continuously see the chiropractor? What if my necks messed up forever now? I feel like I've bothered my doctor so much she no longer takes me seriously. Tells me I'm just anxious. Maybe i am. The twitching of just my left eye, the sound in my ear, and neck pain. I honestly feel so helpless to the cycle.  I had a good two days of not worrying but today. Oof. Been awake since 7am and just nonstop worried"
none,I had a good two days. No panic attacks or anything but today. I noticed a lump behind my ear and here starts the downward spiral. :( i feel like i cant hear. Its hard to breathe and im so stressed. Just took some sleep meds to knock me out so i dont have to deal with it. Was at er like a week ago. Had ct done with contrast but eh. Wasnt good enough for my health anxiety
none,Anybody else having bad allergies thats hyping your anxiety?  Whats some symptoms your having today?
none,Anyone else having horrible allergies right now? Like mega drainage and face numbness? I use flonase and zytec and still suffer with the allergies.

And turmeric made it orange 🤣🤣🤣🙄 Just a funny for you guys to chuckle at! Also a reminder to my darlings. Its allergy season! So your stuff nose,headaches, and just feeling like poop is probably that. Also DONT GOOGLE❤️"
none,So I went to poop. And this runny watery stuff came out. I went to the doctor 2 days ago and was fine. Everything checked out. But now I'm worried and anxious about a CSF.

(Sometimes i feel like they get sick of me and just dont care)I got really sick and since then. I have this odd sound from my neck,numbness on the roof of my mouth. Sounds like sand almost or popping. Only when I lay down. My doctor said i have fluid behind my eardrum. Gave me meds and sent me on my way. Could this sound be my sinuses? What are some tips you'd give for a hypochrondiac? 🥰 Much love"
none,Lets talk about stomach issues from anxiety! Here constantly for a few days I've bad a numb feeling in my belly. Went to ER last night after just not able to deal with anymore. They pushed on my belly. Said felt normal. Done a heart thing . Normal. Took pee for pregnancy test. Negitive. Not sure what it is. Maybe just gas? But it makes my stomach and back hurt. Makes me feel numb. I've been able to poop just fine except today i notice foul smelling mucus. Maybe from the califlower I ate this morning? Orcourse my HA has me panicking because a rash on my back from a Walmart bra. But eh when does it ever end? Anyone else experience this?
none,Anyone else have tmj from anxiety? Because I never realized but after bad panic attacks. My jaw hurts for days after. It honestly sucks and just triggers more. Makes my head feel so tight. Its right below my ear and underneath my jaw and just sucks so bad. Anyone got some tips for me?
none,"I was on zoloft for about a year before i had to go cold turkey. I suffer from anxiety and ocd. Mainly around my health. But, im on 50 mgs of zoloft for about a month now. I was on 200 mgs the first time. Ofcourse im having waves of panic and notice my pupils are huge. I cant even remember my symptoms when i took them the first time. This normal?"
none,"Again. I spend a full night extremely anxious. Near verge of full panic attack but so far Ive done good to keep it all bay. Tonight my anxiety has me fearing my neck.  Not sure why. But I keep fearing that my spine isn't even to my neck. My OCD has me constantly thinking about it. Honestly, I'm utterly at a lost. I sit here now in my bed thinking of the past 4 years I've wasted fearing the unknown at 22. Its got me feeling defeated. Why am I like this? Will it ever get better? Will I ever stop symptom searching constantly? Don't mind my ranting. I'm just attempting to distract myself. I'm just over the anxiety. Over the countless sleepless night i sit and stare at my life. Why cant i live life instead of fearing it?"

Anxiety has me fearing something silly even after a scan less than 2 months ago. Does anyone else hear it? Is it common? Its almost like a hissing, sand moving sound and only happens when Im laying down."
none,Today I freak out about my face. Noticing the right side moves”. I know it isnt but i keep having numbness. Ofcourse I do the FAST. Everythings fine. I know that this time its anxiety. I've dealt with this before. I've had a mri ct and everything this past year. I know that its my anxiety making me scared. But i need someone to talk to me
none,Yet again here I sit. Anxious about something silly. Its a never ending cycle. I was fine and now I fear something silly that I know anxiety causes. Its saddens me honestly. I need to vent to someone. Have a friend who cant help calm me down during moments like these while my fiancé is asleep because i dont want to bother him.

I am currently doing lab experiments and making simple calculations, but most of my time thinking is actually going towards how to properly set up and calibrate the experiment.In terms of background reading I have done very little due to lack of motivation this past year (covid, quals which I thankfully just managed to pass, other ongoing mental and physical health issues), and not knowing the appropriate place to start. I can start by looking at relevant theses and dissertations but it seems rather slow and I forget the majority of things I read, but this seems like the best approach. Papers are almost impossible to fully understand at this point for me.My question is how did you start getting acquainted with your field and topic and what did you find helpful in the learning process? Did you go through theses and textbooks at first before looking at papers? How many hours per day/week did you assign to reading? Do you write all information down in something such as Overleaf?Any advice is appreciated."

I have no idea whether this is anxiety induced.Did a few tests including x-rays, CT in the relevant area, blood test, urinalysis and they came back relatively normal. As far as my doctor is concerned, there are no serious health issues and they think it's a pinched nerve/muscle and recommended me to physical therapy.Just today I looked up all possible causes and found one cause that may be caused by some type of cancer. Now I am not sure if the tests may have ruled out this type of cancer but I am freaking scared. Going to try to get a hold of my doc next week.Do you have any tips to calm down when faced with this type of situation?"

I'm trying to set goals on completing daily lab work. I'm trying to read relevant papers to understand more about my topic. I'm trying to learn the concepts from coursework taken so far, especially when it's relevant to my subfield.Despite this, I feel like I haven't learned much at all and made little progress. There's always something that screws up the experiments in the lab. Reading papers is just as confusing as ever. The concepts from courses and online material just aren't sticking well. Most importantly, I'm getting more and more tired and anxious as time goes by.Does it get easier? For those two have already done at least a year of grad school, how do you cope? How do you pick up things quickly?"

The streamer who said it claimed it was a ""joke"" but this professional player was visibly upset about the ""joke"" on stream. Somebody on another sub called this person pathetic for reacting negatively to it and looking like they were ""about to cry"". That comment had a few hundred upvotes.I made a reply to them explaining that what they were doing is gaslighting, by invalidating the victim's feelings and suggesting that there is something mentally wrong with the *victim* of a joke aimed at them rather than the person who issued the demeaning joke. My comment had negative upvotes. I replied also to another redditor who said the joke was ""harmless"". I explained to them the concept of gaslighting and how different people react differently to different things, and they said things like ""I'm not responsible for other peoples' insecurities"". I even referenced resources online such as [this](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/12/19/18140830/gaslighting-relationships-politics-explained), but they kept on saying the joke was ""innocent"". They didn't seem to understand at all that what they thought was harmless, others may not and that it is perfectly normal for someone to feel hurt by something negative said towards them. They downplayed it by saying things like ""I'm happy you learned gaslighting in your psych 101 class"". In the end after explaining all this to that redditor, they claimed I was gaslighting them. It's like they didn't attempt to understand at all and instead tried to act as immature as possible.Being upset by a joke intended to mock you, no matter how ""light"" or ""innocent"" it was, is PERFECTLY normal. It's NEVER okay to invalidate another person's feelings. It is NEVER okay to suggest that the victim is the problem for being upset rather than the person who said the mean joke. It is NEVER okay to say things like ""you're just so insecure"" or ""you're just too sensitive"" when they feel hurt by something. This is NOT how healthy relationships work. Good relationships are built on understanding, compassion and trust.When you make a joke that upsets someone, you should try to understand from the other person's perspective, and show some compassion by owning up to it and apologizing. THIS is how healthy relationships work, not ""you're so sensitive!"" because doing the latter is an example of gaslighting and a form of emotional abuse."
none,"Many people know that, at least in the past, Hikaru has shown instances of poor sportsmanship and being unable to accept defeat. For instance, during a blitz game in 2014 he [malded after losing to Chessexplained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax4m0nrIe3w). This is the characteristic of a sore loser who tilts too easily because they lost at a game, otherwise they would either say nothing or congratulate their opponent for the win.During the finals of the MC tour, Hikaru said many things. He said things such as ""I was quite unhappy that my webcam turned off"", ""I didn't feel like I was outplayed"" and ""it didn't feel like a loss to me"". If you followed the comments in the pinned posts on the MC finals, many people gave him shit for it. They felt like he was a sore loser who just couldn't accept defeat and that's why he said those things. Furthermore, people say that Hikaru never compliments his opponent after losing.[Check out this video](https://youtu.be/eyF3xeG2yaY?t=2240). Midway during the analysis, Hikaru complimented Magnus and said Magnus played very well multiple times. He said that Magnus's play was excellent and even said that he felt Magnus wasn't playing at his absolute best. He even complimented Ding and said Ding turned into a ""beast"" in rapid/blitz in the last few years. I think this is clear proof that he does acknowledge and respect his opponents.Furthermore, I think many statements of his are taken hugely out of context by the people in this sub. When he said he was annoyed the webcam turned off, he never actually blamed that on the loss of the match. He just made a remark that he was annoyed. When he said he felt like he wasn't outplayed, he clearly meant in the slow positional, grindy sense where the evaluation drops slowly in one person's favor rather than making a huge mistake where the evaluation shifts significantly. When he said it didn't feel like a loss after the last day, he meant in the spirit of the games he felt for the first time he could compete with Magnus rather than taking it personally.With that being said, I think it's just silly to continue bashing a person for what they did in the past and then misquote what they are saying in the present just to continue slandering that person. Yes, Hikaru had many instances of being a sore loser from years back, however his remarks in the present don't reflect that; rather, he reflects that he can change as a person. If you don't think so, you should at least be able to acknowledge that complimenting Magnus, and also Ding and some others, is a step in the right direction."
none,"All around YouTube and other platforms there are videos of anti-maskers going on a rant after being denied service at a private store. When I think of these people I think of white, middle aged, belligerent, anti-science MAGA rednecks and many of them are just that. However there is another group of people who tend to go unnoticed: dumb college kids.I live in a campus town (in the US). Half the people roaming the streets don't even wear a mask. They walk in groups and none of them have masks on. If I want to go anywhere at all, there is a very high chance I'll pass at least two or more people walking together and talking without any mask on. One time I was walking back to my apartment and passed this group of 4-5 kids, and as I passed them one of the bitches makes a fake ""a-choo"" sound because I was wearing a mask. This was like a month and a half ago.What's worse? If I go on my campus's subreddit page, about a third of the posters are anti-mask posts. Many of them claim they can't wait to get back on campus and party. They make posts like ""I ain't no pussy"" and ""tHErE ArE ALwAYs GOnNa bE RiSKs"". It's like some of these morons are completely unaware that they can infect other people, who will infect other people who will succumb to the virus. They do not think about anyone but themselves. One guy even tried to calculate the number of predicted student deaths and corresponding man hours lost over a lifetime, and concluded that it is insignificant. Like wtf is wrong with you? At least a few students will die due to your negligence and all you can think of is how valuable they were in society?Many college kids and young people are morons. They're at least on par with bitter Karens and other boomers you see on YouTube. They only think about how many parties they can attend at the expense of others. They are selfish and they lack empathy. America is truly fucked."

none,"I got my first B+. This blows. I know the sentiment here is to not worry too much about your grades in grad school (as long as you're ""passing"" it doesn't ""really"" matter) but my prelim requirements say that I need to get an A- in 3 different breadth areas. I have already As in my other courses and 2 areas covered, so I need just this one freaking course requirement. Although I'm about 2 years away from actually taking prelim, this means I have to waste another semester chancing at an A- in another course just to fulfill this prelim requirement.How has your day been?"
none,"I don't know if it's only me but my anxiety skyrocketed when I started my PhD program last Fall. Last semester was a wreck; I left a toxic PI and this semester even more so after finding another fit.I have so much crap to do; midterm in a few days in which I am anxious about, reading papers and getting acquainted with the field for my new advisor, massive course assignments and TAing/grading. I'm barely keeping things afloat. On top of it, I'm stuck in my apartment due to this corona business. I'm one of those people (and probably there are quite a few here from the looks of it) who just cannot work productively at home. For the last 3 days, I put in about 2 hours per day tops and I am ashamed of myself. I have to meet my advisor, maintain their expectations and do all this other crap. It's just fucking hard being stuck in my apartment all the time. Procrastination is like a drug, it gives you comfort for a few hours max and then it hits you like a ton of bricks. Doesn't help that I have symptoms of insomnia as well; if I try to go to bed at 12 am sometimes I just can't sleep until around 3~4 am and then wake up at like 1 pm. I just feel... sad; like there's no hope for me, that I'm going to fail.How do you guys manage?"

none,"Whenever someone talks about impostor syndrome I don't really know what they mean.Say you have severe anxiety about your competence, but you almost always deliver work on time and to a good quality. Do you still call that impostor syndrome? Or is impostor syndrome referring to anxiety *and* the fact that you are struggling to meet your advisor's demands and to not disappoint them, to learn quickly, and to be productive?Usually when I think of impostor syndrome I think of the former case where people have self doubts but are overachievers who make their advisor proud. But I'm fitting more into the second category right now so I am just wondering if I am really incompetent."
none,"This applies to undergraduates too.When learning new material, I'm guessing everyone has few questions that pop up now and then as they learn.The way I see it there's a dilemma regarding asking questions. For one, if you are asking questions it can be an indication that you are enthusiastic about the material or the research. On the other hand, it may come off as you being a lazy ass who doesn't bother to research the answer on their own. If it falls outside the scope of the topic, or is covered later in a course it may also come off as you trying to sound like a smartass to impress the Prof.My question is if you have a question in class for a Prof or for an advisor, do you try to Google the answer first and talk explaining how you can't find the answer online or in a text, or do you ask away whenever a question comes up?"
none,"I am a few years out of undergrad and one of the profs at my undergrad institution wrote a recommendation for me twice, one for MS and one for the PhD program I got into and now just started. When I thanked him earlier this year for all the support he has given me, he asked me to keep in touch with him.I want to but the thing is I don't know what to write to him. I have always been pretty awkward in social situations. How do I begin my message? Like should I ask if he has LinkedIn or Facebook (I know that sounds dumb) or something?"
none,"Just started the journey to a PhD, along with some prep in the summer. I don't know how closely this ties in with imposter syndrome but I'm legit not learning fast enough for my research area. Although my advisor doesn't say it, what I am getting from them is a ""hurry the f*ck up"" vibe. I feel like I am just wasting my advisor's time and that they regret picking me for the project.How common is this experience and feeling among beginning PhD students? Do profs expect students to do pretty poorly early on with the intention of whipping them into shape, or do students make decent progress and show competence and expertise at the start?"

I asked my roommate that if he wants to smoke inside, that he only does it in his room with any openings covered and the vents inside his room covered. He agreed to do these things. I told him multiple times to do this. Despite this, he does a poor job of this or completely disregards this. (1) he most likely does not have his vent shut. (2) when he has friends over, they smoke with the doors open. (3) he likely does not have his room shut when I am not around because I can clearly smell the weed when I come back in the afternoon/evening.This shit is driving me mad. Should I lay it down on him that he can't do that?Furthermore, it appears to be that the other rooms are leased by somebody, however there have been multiple different people living in the rooms of the apartment at different times. They are all in this friend group and it seems like his friends are all swapping living in the apartment at different times but with each individual bedroom under one person's name.I am really contemplating just letting the apartment manager know and risk 99% of getting evicted. I don't want to smell that shit in the apartment. My throat is sore and I have trouble sleeping because of this shit.How is it possible that some people can be just so inconsiderate? I have had to deal with this shit in the past so I don't know if it is a common thing to be paired with such shitty roommates.

No I don't want to listen to Ariana Grande. Neither do I want to listen to Ed Sheeran. Nor Billie Eilish, Post Malone, Imagine Dragons, Bruno Mars, or any other crappy pop artist.If someone blasted classic rock, people will be quick to judge. If these people tried to shove rock, jazz, and classical music down others' throats, those others will tell them to f off to r/lewronggeneration.

The main thing I am scared of is not performing well and disappointing my PI. I don't know what they're like in person. My PI wants me to read up on and learn some things but I already feel like a failure and that I'm not learning fast enough (I KNOW I am not because I am spending way too much time lurking on Reddit for my own good). I know that if you're at a competitive school, the expectations are very high. I feel like I'm not cut out for this and that my PI should have chosen another student over me. I'm just so fucking scared that my PI already regrets his choice and that I'm going to do shit work for the next few years. Am I overthinking this? Has anyone else here been through a similar phase?On top of that I feel burned out this summer. My current advisor frequently tells me that I've done an excellent job for the past year but I don't know how much of that is genuine. But I will be moving on and attending a different school... so different expectations for different PIs. I have just finished my current degree, and I just want a few days, just a few days..., to relax and travel around a bit - but no time for that since I have other commitments to tend to as well.

The types who then act all aggressive afterwards. The types who will never admit to fault. Fuck those types of people. Oh I didn't do what you asked? Sure, I could have maybe double checked with you, but you could ALSO work on explaining shit better. You're using an aggressive tone on me because you think I did something pointless (e.g. touch an item)? Well fuck you too, you want me to act all condescending and give you a taste of your own goddamn medicine? These aggressive and egotistical assholes just piss me off so much.

No phone support listed, no live chat listed. I then visited [https://www.google.com/contact/](https://www.google.com/contact/) to see whether I could speak to a technical expert by calling an office.

There is virtually no ""support team"" other than the garbage support site (apart from having a G Suite subscription?

none,"When I applied this cycle I seriously thought I wouldn't get in anywhere. You see, I'm a guy with a lot of self doubt. My research experience is probably pretty mediocre compared to a lot of folks here, and it's not directly related to the area I'll likely be working in for the next few years. However I recently got accepted into my 2nd choice program, and after talking to the PI it would have likely been my first choice anyway! I'm real happy to be able to now chase after my dreams (provided I don't screw anything up between now and the start of the program!).This cycle was definitely a learning experience for me. I learned to have more more faith in myself and to be more proactive (more experience probably wouldn't have hurt as I have been ghosted by several places). There are definitely some things I could have done better but I think what helped me the most was that my SOP showed that I was passionate about a field and that I demonstrated to my refs that I was a capable and committed student. So to anyone who is still going through this process, or planning to go through this process, you don't need crazy stats and research experience to get into a good program. Show the committee and your would be recommenders that you are really passionate about your field and want to push its limits, and that you have the drive to succeed (it would also probably help immensely to review the work of a few professors and reach out to them beforehand to see if they are looking for students).To anyone who is still waiting to hear back, I know how stressful it is so all I can say is hang in there."

I got one from a PI who said they are going through the process of officially getting me in about 2 weeks ago, but I don't have that official letter from the school yet.

none,"I am an international applicant. I applied to several PhD programs in the US last Fall.Most schools require international students to submit TOEFL or IELTS scores, with exemptions in certain cases. I am a citizen of and did my undergrad in a country in which English is the primary language (so according to most schools I am exempt).When I go back and check my application status, some schools reported my TOEFL/IELTS scores as ""missing"" or my application as being ""submitted"" (shouldn't it be something along the lines of ""in review""?). I checked the requirements on their graduate office websites to confirm that I am eligible for a waiver to the requirement. I submitted most of my applications a day before their deadlines. Is it possible that the schools don't ""know"" that an ELP exam waiver should be applied to my application or that they didn't have time to apply the waiver due to me submitting my applications a day before the deadline, therefore rendering my application incomplete by most schools? If I email them regarding this issue, will they still review my application or have they put my application in the discard pile already and given offers to applicants whose applications are ""complete""?"
none,"Last Fall I took a project orientated class with a professor. At the start of my project I looked up a bunch of papers to see whether what I was going to do has already been achieved before. Turns out there was next to nothing on this very specific method I planned to test (at least from what I was able to dig up).The course is over now, and that was only a part of my project (my project had a different focus). However the professor and one of his grad students is continuing on where I left off, but I am not sure whether he knows there is little work done in this area. Would I look foolish if I suggested to him that it might be possible to publish the results if we get results we want, seeing as how he is an expert in his area and I am not? As a naive grad student only beginning their career in research, I am not sure whether this is how research goes. He's not my advisor but I'd be happy to work with him on this as a mini project if it means we can publish something."

none,"Is there any point in asking a professor from a class I have taken (and did well) that is related to my field of interest? How much will this affect my chances, compared to a professor whom I did research for during one summer, a few years ago (that isn't related to my field of interest)?"
none,"I don't have many great options in terms of who I can ask for for a recommendation letter.I am currently an M.S. student. I can ask my advisor who I am currently working with, and also another professor from a project-focused course (assuming I do well and can get good results within the next few weeks).For the 3rd recommendation letter, should I ask a professor whose course I have taken in the past? I haven't interacted with most of them outside classroom hours but I have been amongst the top in terms of individual marks for most courses. Has anyone actually tried this approach and gotten into competitive places for their PhD?The other option is that I ask a professor from my undergrad whom I have done summer research with but I don't know whether he even remembers me since it has been about 4 years since I finished my undergrad, and that professor is not working in the subfield I want to pursue."
none,

I am also taking a project-orientated course, and another course that is semi-related to my area of interest. These three professors are the only professors who I can think of. I have been working with my advisor for some time, but the courses wrap up in mid November/early December.Is asking for recommendation letters in early/mid November too late for PhD programs that have early/15 December deadlines? My advisor wants to push me into the PhD program at the school I am currently in but I want to try elsewhere, where there are more opportunities in the area I am interested in. Should I just ask my advisor about taking a gap year so that I can apply to other schools? Doesn't seem like they'll be happy with that decision, but I'm not either, I don't think I have a choice if I want to apply elsewhere.Edit: forgot to add that I have already taken the GRE."
none,"Everyday, I always have one of these two thoughts lingering in my mind:1. You have cancer2. If not, you'll probably get it in the (near) futureThen it leads to other thoughts such as:- I've lived long enough (I'm in my 20s), longer than most other species, living extra is just a bonus- what's the point in life if we all just get cancer, suffer miserably and die? (Better to just die now than suffer a painful death later on)And I also often picture people rotting in their caskets.This is exacerbated when I find anything that is wrong with my body. Right now, I have some small spot that looks like a cross between a mole and a pimple (with a bit of scarring because I squeezed it), Dr. just gave me some cream and said come back in a few weeks if it doesn't go away. Now I'm scared it could be skin cancer like melanoma, or something even more sinister.I also frequently lurk the r/cancer subreddit and I see people in their 20s and 30s posting all the time of their battle. The chance of getting cancer at that age is very small, but the very fact that it happens scares me. This is reinforced by the fact that even minor symptoms such as having a cough can lead to a diagnosis such as AML.Is anyone like this, who is also obsessed with having or getting cancer, and always constantly looking up news and other people's battles?"

I know that having research experience under your belt is very important, but that is the main issue I have. I currently have a research advisor and I expect to start doing research during summer. However, that only allows me to obtain one good research-related letter (provided I impress the Prof of course). Should the 2 other recommendation letters just come from Profs who I taken classes with?

none,"By ""God"" I mean any and every god that has ever been conceived. Say we had a means of observing/determining the state of a ""supernatural"" realm, and we see that there is no higher conscience that created us. Could what we observe only be one state of an infinite collection of states of this realm? If we had another realm and repeated the same observation, could we in fact find that there is a god or multiple gods? Could the mere fact that we are observing this realm change the state of this realm to one out of an infinite set of possibilities?If we can agree that this is a possibility, can we also say that it is illogical to even debate the existence of any gods because gods or no gods can both be true?Thoughts, atheists?"

This new roommate is using it as a shared room, when clearly it is a single room and it is not supposed to be shared.This person has at least 1 or 2 other people sleeping over every night and they keep yapping in the middle of the fucking night from like 1am onwards. Half the time I can't sleep. They also smoke inside the fucking apartment aswell.Should I report this person to the apartment managers?"
none,"I went to the U.S. recently and holy crap the coffee is expensive. It costs ~$4.50 USD just to get a regular mocha. From where I am from, it will cost $3.00 USD max just to get the same drink. I added soy milk to that, and it ended up costing over $6, whereas I can get the same deal for ~$3.50 USD in my country.Anyone else think Starbucks is ridiculously overpriced in the U.S.?"
none,"Today, I had a class but I didn't understand much of what the Professor said. I thought about why and I came to some conclusions:(1) I tried to copy the diagrams and facts in the slides, and what the Professor said, AND tried to understand him at the same time. When I am too busy writing down the subtle details, my mind can't concentrate on the concepts and meaning behind them and I lose track easily. This tends to create a snowball effect.(2) This was a ""fact"" based class (it was a class on technical manufacturing processes), and many facts were presented (I was busy writing them down).IMO there are different types of classes; the two main ones I have encountered are:Type A: Slower paced, mathematically orientated classes where the Professor usually hand writes the math and derivations. I usually have little to no problem understanding these classes as I can write down the notes and also think about the logic as the Professor is going through the math.Type B: Where a slew of diagrams and facts are presented in each slide, and the Professor discusses these facts, applications, advantages, disadvantages, challenges, etc. I tend to struggle more with these because my mind is usually focused on copying down all the facts which interferes with my comprehension of what the Professor is saying.My question is for you folks who have encountered classes similar to ""type B"", what is your strategy in getting the most out of the class? Do you keep the note taking to a minimum and set your mind on listening to what the Professor says, then maybe later download and amend the slides by adding details of what you remember? What did you find works best for you?"
none,"Here's my situation.I just started my M.S. program. I am interested in a subfield, let's call it X. I don't have a formal background in X.Currently I am enrolled in a computational/modelling course related to a broad field that includes X, due to the suggestion of the Prof. teaching that course. The Prof. says that background knowledge isn't required and that he can help me if I lack knowledge in an area. It's a small class and he knows everyone. The Prof. is highly respected in his department, very knowledgeable, and super nice. However, this Prof. is not in the same department that I am in. The course is also in another department.On the other hand, there is another course that gives students a theoretical foundation in subfield X. This course is also in the other department, but it is taught by a Prof. who is jointly in my department and also the department that the other Prof. is in.I am in a dilemma regarding which course to take. I cannot take both. If I stick with the computational/modelling class I may not get the necessary background knowledge I need in subfield X, depending on how much the Prof. can teach me in that area. Also, as this Prof. is in another department, I may be limited in who I can ask to be my thesis advisor (especially if I don't have a theoretical basis in X). On the other hand, based on his teaching style I may learn a lot from him. If I decide to go with the theoretical course focused primarily on X, it may disappoint the Prof. teaching the computational/modelling class because he knows everyone who has registered for his course (it's a small class). Also, the theoretical course may also be a bit too advanced for me considering that I have minimal background in X. On the other hand, it will give me a solid foundation in this area. I can also possibly discuss research opportunities with the Prof. teaching the theoretical course as he is in my department, whereas the Prof. teaching the computational course isn't.I need to make a final decision quickly because the deadline to change classes without incurring any penalties is approaching. I know this is perhaps too vague for anyone to give solid advice, but what would you guys do in this situation?"
none,"I have my F-1 visa interview in about a week's time. However, due to time constraints (related to my current work and finding housing) I am not sure whether I can make it for the Fall semester in time.Is it still acceptable to attend the visa interview and defer my admission if I need to? Do I need to explain this to the consular officer? Will there be any legal implications later on if I attend the visa interview and then immediately decide to defer assuming I get the F-1 visa? Wouldn't that be equivalent to lying to the consular officer about when I plan to attend? Or should I just cancel the interview, defer, and get a new I-20 instead?"
none,"Are there any international students (studying in ths US) who can help me out with the questions below?Is it acceptable to put down the address of the school in the nonimmigrant DS-160 form under ""Place where you will stay in the U.S."", if I have not found student housing yet? Is it common for F-1 visa students to do this? Will there be any difficulties with obtaining the F-1 visa during the interview?Also suppose I find housing right before, or shortly after my interview knowing that I have my visa approved. Is there any way to update the form? Also once I fly and land at an airport, do immigration officials question why you put down the school address?My main concern is that the consular officer may deem my form as being misleading and that, because it is a legal document, I will be permanently barred from entering the United States for providing ""false"" information."
none,"I was admitted to a 2-year MS program. I have several questions about the F-1 Visa interview to study in the US.Finance related:1. Do I have to show 2x the amount written in the Form i20? Would I get away with showing say 1.8x?2. I have read that I should show 6 months worth of bank statements. Is this necessary or will 1 recent one be sufficient?3. If my parents are willing to support me, do I have to have them write and sign a letter of support to show to the Consular Officer? Or are recent bank statements from my parents' bank accounts sufficient? If the former, is there a standardized template?4. Do I need to show 6 months worth of bank statements from my parents, if they are supporting me, or will 1 recent one be sufficient?5. Is it necessary to show tax returns, and for how many years?6. Do my financial statements need to show the amount in USD? Or can I show the amount in my home country's currency? If the latter, what do I need to prove to the Consular Officer what the exchange rates are?Proof of non-immigrant intent:7. Is ""my family all reside in my home country"" a sufficient explanation to prove non-immigrant intent?8. What ""proof"" do I need to convince the Consular Officer that I don't intend to immigrate the United States? I don't own any major assets such as property, or investments. The main asset I have is my savings account. I don't have a guarantee of employment in my home country after I graduate.If anyone has been through it, any input is appreciated."
none,"I was admitted to a grad program in the US as an international student. I have sufficient personal funds to show for my I-20. However, my online bank account statements do not state the type of currency in its figures. I have called the bank and a customer rep said there is no way to change the statements to show this. They do show the address of the bank including the country.My bank statement I sent to the school was rejected because it didn't show the currency value. I have emailed them explaining the situation but they never replied to any of my emails in the past, and they haven't changed certain details in my profile that I asked them to change. Furthermore, they almost never respond to phone calls. I called them many times over the past week or 2 regarding other issues but they never pick up, and it costs me a few dollars (in USD) per call.Had anyone else had this problem? If you were admitted as an international student and your bank statement was not initially accepted due to the reason above, was it accepted after you explained it to the school? Am I destined to not attend grad school because my bank statement does not say ""INR"", ""CAD"", ""AUD"", etc?"
none,"Lately I've found my specific anxieties around specific health conditions haven't been as strong  which is great. What I didn't count on was a vague feeling of doom kind of hovering over me to replace it.I have no major symptoms that are new for me at the moment. Fatigue, but I've had that for years now. If it were gonna kill me, it likely would have by now. I have sore spot on my hip but there's no bruise. It'll probably go away.But  without any real reason to, and without even doing research, my brain just makes connections between these things and SOMETHING. Cancer or heart disease of some kind perhaps. Its like I've trained myself to just make these wild connections with no reason to do so.Does anybody else get this? Never quite happy or comfortable because even when the health anxiety seems tame, there is still a darkness hanging over head. I'm still convinced I'm dying, but I just don't know what from. To be clear, I'm not asking for a diagnosis, because I guess there are no major symptoms for me to even wonder about anyway. I'm just looking for a cheer up chat and to know I'm not alone."
none,"I'm a 26 year old guy. I've had health anxiety pretty terribly for the last few years. Last year I dropped to part time at work to help with my mental state, and while the reduced workload has been helpful, I haven't done anything of much value with the time.I don't really exercise, my diet is questionable, my sleep isn't great, I play wayyy too many video games and of course I am ALWAYS anxious. I have felt quite tired for a number of years now, so, in trying to be rational as we so often aren't with this kind of anxiety, I'm trying to acknowledge that I have some bad habits that could very easily be the cause of my tiredness.Now obviously, there is a lot I need to change, but much of it is what I find comfort in... laying awake at night with youtube or Netflix, playing PC games. They're my happy and secure places. So it feels overwhelming to go out and try to change everything.So, I'm seeking advice. What changes have you made that have made a positive impact on your life, particularly with regards to giving you more energy.Thanks."
none,"As people suffering with debilitating hypochondria, its so important that we place trust in medical professionals, otherwise we will drive ourselves insane.I say this completely hypocritically because just today I went and saw a doctor to check what I thought were swollen lymph nodes. They turned out not to be swollen at all and I quote ""are not clinically concerning at all"".This made me feel better, but he checked my throat, presumably to look for infection due to my presentation with apparent swollen nodes, and he paused. For a long time. He wore a facial expression of... confusion. Or concern? It was hard to tell.Anyway, I knew exactly what he was looking at. About a year or a year and a half ago, I discovered what looked to me like a cyst on my left tonsil. Whitish-yellow in colour. And another slightly larger one on the same tonsil. I went to my GP who said it was a tonsil stone. I disagreed because I've had tonsil stones before. They dislodge. This didn't. I got a second GPs opinion, who also said it was a tonsil stone. Then I went back to my first GP and got a referral to an ENT for a sore throat that I had had for a while  of course afraid I had some kind of throat cancer. The ENT performed a larygoscopy and confirmed I was fine. He also mentioned the tonsil growth and just said its nothing to worry about. That people come in with them all the time. That set my mind at ease at the time because 3 physocians had told me it was fine at that point.Cue this GP today looking at it funny. I tell him the story I just shared... well, I cut it down to the referral to an ENT part. And he says that if an ENT saw it and said it was fine, then that's good enough for him. I asked what he might have been concerned about it being. He said that it could be some kind of residual infection.This led me down the path of tonsillar cysts and tonsillar cancer once more. While I am pretty sure it isn't cancer (if it was I figure I'd be in bad shape by noe), I still feel like its a cyst or something more than a tonsil stone. And so  I am seeing yet ANOTHER doctor to get ANOTHER opinion in two days. Just in case it should be biopsied. This is CRAZY. I am driving myself CRAZY.Don't be like me. Be the opposite of me. Trust in medical professionals. Because otherwise, we end up like me... sitting in a meverending stream of doctors lounges finding new and creative ways to tell our stories to new doctors that don't make us sound nuts.But also... help a guy out. Share your advice with me. Peace."
none,"So, you idolize him?”A painful question.Head back against the plush cushioning of the occasional chair, he watches the ceiling fan. He tries to imagine the blades are small birds; robins or fairy-wrens dancing rhythmically. As his fingers dig more deeply into the armrests positioned rigidly at his sides, he realises this particular cognitive method isn't really working. How can I imagine birds from nothing? How would it help? I did.” He swallows deeply, wishing he could avoid the question. Before he...” He trails off, refocussing his attention on his imaginary birds.But you don't anymore?” There's a coldness to the question; a lack of familiarity, which burns at him like dry ice, sticking to the wound and searing deeper and deeper into his flesh.Don't what?”Idolize him.”Why would I?” Why would I? It seems a logical response to a stupid question.He's your big brother.”So?”It's connotative.” Connotative?” He mimics the word in his most condescending, posh British accent. A wanky word deserves a wanky voice. Connotative of what?”What do you think?”Of what?”The connotations.”Of ‘big brother'?”Yes.”A sly smile wraps across his cheeks and he lifts his head to meet the eye line of the man sat in the chair across from him. Well,” he begins, secure in the brilliance of his smugness, it's all about the panopticon theory, really. Are you familiar?” He doesn't give the man in the chair a chance to answer, In 1785 the founder of utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham, with the aid of his brother, developed the theory of the ‘panopticon'. He conceptualised that a new kind of prison where there would only be one guard tower with a three hundred and sixty degree view would stand amid an endless collection of jail cells, and lookout over all of the convicts.” He paused for a millisecond, anticipating an interruption, but none came. This would allow the guards to see all of the prisoners, but the prisoners would only see the guards. This idea was adopted on a conceptual level by George Orwell in 1949, when his novel 1984 was published. 1984— did you read it in high school?” This time, no pause is offered. —imagined a dystopian, authoritarian society where all were ruled by ‘Big Brother' who oversaw everybody's movements and actions at all times.” Smile still broad across his face, he leans his head back and once again attempts to picture the birds on the ceiling. So  power, control; omniscience.” Silence.Time slows as he waits for a response. And as the clock ticks on and the birds become no clearer, he feels more and more like some shrivelled vegetable in a bath of brine, laying back and fermenting for far too long. The salt attacking his skin; wrinkling it into something horrible and unrecognisable. Something inedible and devoid of flavour. Something forgotten. The smile dissipates as he lifts his head once more to look at the man in the chair. His eyes haven't moved. They remain still and blue; piercing. Like they could bore into his brain and dig through the goo until they find his darkest thoughts and his most personal memories.What do you think are the connotations of ‘big brother'?” The man in the chair pauses, offering a brief opportunity for response; a return fire. When none comes, he continues, As in an older, male sibling.”He tries his best to find his smile again; wants nothing more than to dust it off and stitch it back over his mouth, but for the time being, it's nowhere to be found. Lost. Pulling his gaze, he returns to his previous position in search of the doves and the blue jays.You mentioned power, control and omniscience.”So?”Those are authoritative words.”Orwellian dystopia is authoritative.”I mean about your brother.”The ceiling is white. The walls are white. The room feels small to him; three by five. A relative shoebox and all he can see is the man in chair because even the fucking birds won't fly for him. I wasn't talking about my brother.”A pause that seems eternal before the most painful response. I think you were.”He chooses not to answer, instead tightening his grip on the brown leather of his occasional chair. His knuckles whiten as the blood flow is slowed to his hands, the force with which he squeezes stifling its current.Do you feel that your brother has power over you? Control?”He refocusses his energy on the ceiling fan. The birds. The feathered angels whose job it is to calm him; who've never failed in their duty to bring him peace before when he studies them through binoculars and sketches their beauty on his watercolour-stained pages. The winged creatures that for whatever fucking reason are today so elusive. He's not here. He closes his eyes tightly, allowing not even a speck of white or light into view.Do you feel you cannot escape his influence?”His eyes remain shut, holding the outside world at bay. It's dark. Frightening. Like he's always there?”He opens his eyes to see another room. One with pale blue walls and lavender curtains covering the windows. He recognises it. The walnut desk, fixed to the wall by a rusting bracket. It's chipped around the edges, like it ways has been. Damaged, like him.Getting up from his chair, he walks to his bed. The blanket his mother sowed for him sits in a pile at its foot, thrown to the floor during the night by the boy who lays restlessly asleep in the cramped, single bed before him. The boy's face, contorted into an expression of fear and discomfort, is illuminated by a streak of moonlight pushing its way between a gap in the curtains.Sweat beads his forehead and his hands begin to shake. Grabbing at his pant legs doesn't help to quell the quivering. He turns around to face the bedroom door because he knows what happens next.A door slowly opens.A tall, broad-shouldered silhouette enters.A bottle in one hand; an artificial extension of his arm.A slow shuffle towards the sleeping boy.A raised arm.A scream.His eyes snap shut and tears roll down his cheeks. He is always there.” He opens them once more and he's back in the white shoebox, alone with the man in the chair. Every night.”But not really.”A painful response. A bullshit response.We've—” The man in the chair cuts himself off, considering his words carefully. Thoughtfully. You've talked about this at length with me now. And we always come back to the same point – which I think is important – that you've not seen him in years. He's never come back. It's important. Pertinent, even, that you move on from this.” Pausing for a moment, he looks over his patient, head back, staring at the ceiling. Have you been using the cognitive strategies, David?”Yes.”Have they been helping?”Some.”Which ones? The birds?”David chuckles internally at his futile attempts to see the fucking birds. Building evidence helps.”Great. So apply that here. Is it possible that he will come back?” The man pauses for an eternal moment, making sure his patient is listening; forcing enough discomfort to bring him into the present and making eye contact. Sure. But, is it likely? No. A plane could fall out of the sky and crash into us right now, turning us to dust in seconds. But what are the chances of that actually happening?”Silence.Well?” The man in the chair leans forward and opens his hands, prompting a response.David sighs, knowing he's right. Pretty slim,” he says. Pretty fucking slim.” ***A tall, broad-shouldered man stands silently between the trees that line the suburban street, occasionally lifting a bottle to his lips, and cringing slightly upon each sip. He is doused in shadow, hidden below the canopy, where not even the moonlight can spot him.It's been a couple of hours, but he's happy to wait. The soft breeze that gently strokes his cheeks is refreshing, and the night is cool. Comfortable. He's happy to wait. He's used to waiting.A brake pad squeals in the distance. Turning his head slightly, he watches a navy blue SUV pull into the driveway across the street.This is it.He takes one last sip from his bottle before dropping it to the ground below. It hits the grass by his feet with a dull, nearly imperceptible thud. A slim man appears form the driver's side door. He shuts it, locks the vehicle and begins moving slowly towards his front door.Closing his eyes, the tall man breathes in deeply, savouring the taste of the cool autumn air before stepping out from the cover of the trees and into the moonlight that soaks the street in front of him. This is it."
none,"Sex: maleAge: 25, turning 26Medications: Nexium 20mg daily Conditikns: GERDI've had these 2 hard balls under my jawline, one on the left side and one on the right side, for at least a few years now  though probably longer. I have vague memories of them when I was younger.They are about the size of small marbles, but larger than peas. Both are the same or similar size and both feel the same.They are spherical and hard, but seem to be moveable, though it could just be the skin around them moving when I touch them. Its hard to tell.The last week or so I have noticed that they seem a little bigger and slightly tender. No change in texture or shape. They aren't visible or protruding out from under my jaw.I have read online that if these are lymph nodes, then spherical shape and hard texture are suspicious traits and could be signs of malignancy. Even though I have had them for a long time, the slight growth that I think I've noticed and their tenderness are troubling me.I am tired/fatigues often, but I don't sleep as much as I should and its not so bad that I cannot function or I pass out in the middle of the day.

none,"I am terrified of skin cancer. I should very much be comfortable in the knowledge that at least for the next 6 months, I'm not going to die of melanoma.I am 26, apparently healthy, don't get too much sun exposure and have had 4 skin checks, one by a dermatologist, since December because I just wanted every doctor in Australias opinion I guess.And that 4th skin check did satisfy me for a while. Until one of my moles began to itch. And then another one did. And then another one did. And I know, logically one might say 'well, that's classic anxiety.' Itd probably be more sus if only one of them was itchy. But the kicker is, they get itchy even when I'm not thinking about them. Then I begin to analyse them, look at them super closely. Maybe that light brown one on my thigh has a bit of pink in it. Don't they say moles shouldn't have more than one colour? Two of these moles should actually be the poster boys of benign moles by all the ABC definitions, and yet, I have still booked an appointment for Friday to see my GP and get them checked. Again. Because when I had my skin checks they weren't itching. So, something has changed since then, right?I hate HA. Its this endless, torturous cycle of angst and pain. Its exhausting. I hate it. I'm terrified, though likely have no reason to be. I feel sure I'll push to have 4 moles biopsied just for peace of mind, only to be told they were all benign, but lucky me, then I'll have 4 useless scars to show for it.Dammit. Can anyone relate?Thanks for reading my rant if you got this far."

It was squishy, almost like it was filled with fluid.Well it went down after 4 or 5 days. But I feel like it didn't go down completely. There is definitely a slight difference between that side and the left side. It's a little more noticeable, though you wouldn't see it without touching it.I don't if it's coming up and going down over and over or if it's just staying the same size. But it's freaking me out.The annoying part is I have shown it to two doctors, both of whom have said they cannot really feel anything. And both of whom seemed unconcerned. So I am left wondering - did they not feel it because they weren't thorough enough? Both were very quick and we're secondary to why I had the appointments. Is it normal for it not to have gone down completely even though there was no obvious cause for it being swollen in the first place?I keep trying to tell myself that it's not very swollenn so it's probably fine, but I'm just freaking myself out thinking it's the big C. Specifically the L kind.Thanks for reading if you did... Does anyone have any advice?"

none,"I'm a big Modern Warfare 19 fan. I played CoD 4, World at War and Modern Warfare 2 10 years ago when they were huge. Those were my CoD's. I bought Black Ops 1, but never really got into the multiplayer. I didn't hate it, but I kind of just went off gaming for a while. In 2019, I picked up a refurbished Xbox One and a copy of Modern Warfare Remastered and got back into it a decade or so later. When Modern Warfare 19 was released, I loved it immediately, in spite of its issues. I have defended it against the naysayers for the last year.So, when I saw gameplay of Black Ops: Cold War, I was underwhelmed and disappointed that it appeared to be a step in the wrong direction. But, I pre-ordered the game to access the early access beta, which I have no been playing. And damn...This game is rad. Like, it's **a lot** of fun.Having said this, I don't think it is actually fair to compare it entirely to Modern Warfare 19. There doesn't really need to be a debate, because based on my gameplay, they are completely different games that one would play when in completely different moods. So, instead of saying which is better and which is worse, I thought I'd share my thoughts on what is better in each, but also what needs work. For anybody that cares, anyway... (haha)**Where Modern Warfare 19 excels:**\- **Animations.** I don't think it is controversial to say that MW's animations are ground breaking. The way you slide, the way you can bunny hop around corners and the smoothness with which you can move in different ways around the map. One thing I have noticed while playing Cold War is the lethal throwing animation is bizarre. It takes a wildly long time to throw a grenade, and it looks awkward.\- **Graphics.** This is subjective, but I must say, I do prefer the realistic, gritty graphics of MW19. Having said that, I would understand why some might prefer the arcade style of CW.\- **Gunplay.** In my mind, this is undeniably better in MW. Each gun moves in a unique way. Recoil patterns are different for everything, and are noticeably difficult or easy to control on certain weapons. This was a positive thing for the game. While MW does have issue with weapon balancing, one thing they got right in this department was recoil and gunplay.\- **Spectacle.** MW19 is a visual beauty. Sure, there are some issues with shadows, but on balance, the game is beautiful. particularly if you have the luxury of playing PC and really getting tricky with the colour palette. **Where Cold War excels:**\- **Score Streaks.** Their decision for to use score streaks, I hope, will result in more people playing OBJ. But, the big positive for me here is that it makes the game more satisfying for newbies. Rather than creating camping spots, the devs have given people newer to the game an opportunity to hit their streaks, even if they die, which I hope will make the game seem less intimidating to newer players.\- **Map Design.** (Generally) smaller maps, less camping spots encourages more combat and a faster pace. You can still camp if you want, and you can still play slower and more methodically, but the game doesn't punish you nearly as much for running and gunning.\- **Health bars.** I love these. Some may not, but I like being able to see my own health as well as the enemy.\- **SPAWNS.** Some of this stuff is subjective, but the spawns in MW are undeniably terrible. This game feels like old, sensible spawns where you don't get mowed down the second you enter the game.**Extra thoughts:**The initial backlash, with regards to it feeling like an old gen, outdated game, to the game when streamers and youtubers played the alpha, is wrong. It definitely does **not** feel like a previous gen game. MW19 is ground breaking in its mechanics and gunplay, so I feel like that actually isn't representative of the vast majority of shooters. This doesn't feel as new and shiny as MW for sure, but it certainly doesn't feel old or outdated either. **It just feels different.** Like a different shooter. Like one day you don't feel like loading up MW, so you load up this instead for a different experience.The graphics aren't terrible either. They are, if not on par, close to MW and are certainly superior to a lot of other current gen games.So ultimately, I feel like the community shouldn't really compare these games, because they are completely different. I know this post does compare aspects of the games, but I was hoping more to point out areas in which we can appreciate both. I will certainly keep playing MW, but I also look forward to adding another, **different** shooter to my library.I'm sure there is soooo much more to talk about, but these are just my thoughts after a couple hours of gameplay.Would love to hear what other people think!"
none,"I haven't posted or even looked at the page in a long time. Then yesterday I noticed what seems to be a swollen lymph node under my right ear.i guess it's possible it could be a cyst, but I'm not sure.This pornpted me to do something I haven't done in a long time... Google. An old anxiety of lymphoma reared its ugly head and now I've spiralled a bit. I know logically I should monitor it for a couple weeks and see if it goes down, but I am so frightened. Anxiety just makes me feel so isolated and desolate.

So I was hoping y'all could gave me some opinions for alternatives.The chip denominations I can use are $1, $5, $25 and $100.Ideally we would get things down to about 40 or 50 bb starting stacks, but I am unsure uow to balance these denominations.Let me know your thoughts!

I am an anxious person, so my mind goes straight to the worst, life threatening illnesses. But, does this kind of pain sound like VH to anyone who has it?

none,"So, my last real gaming experience was with MW2 when I was 14 or 15, which is now about 10 years ago. I decided to get back into it, so I bought an Xbox One last year and bought MW19 when it came out. I feel, considering my 10 year hiatus, I have done pretty well. And with crossplay, I am able to play with all my mates who play PC. This has made me decide to get a PC. Until I do that in the coming months, however, I have bought a mouse and keyboard and am practicing on Xbox. I only really put in some solid time today. And mostly I did okay. Went positive in all but one online game.But, how long do people who have made the transition feel it took them to truly get a grasp for mouse and keyboard? My fingers get so confused!"

none,"I want to know how everyone sets up their home games.

We do winner takes all, unless it goes too late, then the final two csn split 60/40. So kind of a tournament style game.It is always fun, but pretty brutal if you are the first one or two to go out, or if you make it to the end and then have no winnings to show.I guess I am wondering how people go with home cash games, where your stack is relative to your cash and you can 'cash out'?"

While not exactly my 'stomach', I do wonder if it could be an ulcer as I had a clean abdominal ultrasound, as well as other clean tests for other organs in the recent past.So: despite being clear of H.

none,"Hi all, I was hoping to get some advice and some experiences from people in their diagnosis?I am 25(m).For a few years now I have had pretty consistent daytime fatigue/tiredness. I regulalry get 7-8 hours of sleep, with the occasional 5-6, but I never feel totally rested. I am not struggling to stay awake during the day, but my eyes feel irritated/fatigued and I yawn quite regularly. I feel like this prettt much as soon as I wake up, right until I go to bed. It doesn't seem to matter how much sleep I get.My girlfriend says I do not now, nor have ever snored. We have been together since we were 16 and she says that I have never snored, nor stopped breathing or appeared to choke. I did talk in my sleep when I was a kid and in my teens, but she says I haven't done that for a few years.I don't wake up too often during the night. Occasionally for a few seconds, but I am never gasping for air. I sleep through most nights. I do have diagnosed GERD, but this is mainly managed with PPI treatment, and I have never really experienced the severe symptoms some get like acid regurgitation. The final thing is that I do semi regularly wake up with dry or sore throat and mouth, but not every morning. I have always put this down to dry air.My dentist has an at home sleep apnea test they offer and as they have treated me for TMJ already, I wonder if it is worth checking for sleep apnea as well.Thanks."

none,"Hi, I am on a bit of a nostalgia bender at the moment, rediscovering all of my old bands I used to listen to. I remember loving a specific song from a band that, in my country Australia, wasn't very big. I do not remember the name of the band, the name of the song, or even how it goes, hence why I am having trouble finding it. I was hoping, with even limited information, maybe someone on here might be able to help a guy in his mid twenties rediscover some of his teenage musical love. I'll put as much as I remember below:The vocalist had a very unique 'growl' - it was almost black metal-y in its roughness. They, like many metalcore bands, sang the chorus with a rocky kind of voice. Mostly, I remember the music video. The band were playing their song in a desert location in what from memory were broken houses or ruins. There was an incredibly blue sky in the background. I also remember the band broke up, and I don't think it was a pleasant separation from memory.Their sound was similar to August Burns Red and As I Lay Dying, but with more clean singing. Probably quite similar to old school All That Remains as well.Anyway, that is all I got. If you have any ideas, or even just wanna throw out some band names, I would be super appreciative. Thanks."
none,"25, male, 40mg nexium daily in the morning for GERD.I also have TMJ, and clecnh my jaw in my sleep. I have a mouth guard, but occasionally go through periods of bad stress and still get headaches despite the mouth guard. I am prescribed valium from my GP for this. I only ever use it when I need it, and make sure that I don't take it more than twice in one week. Usually the script he gives me lasts me the full year.I have read online that these two medications can hsve bad interractions. I intend on asking my GP about this but with COVID it is difficult to get an appointment. Would it be safe to occasionally take 10mg valium before bed if I am taking Nexium 40s daily?"
none,"I am 25 and male. In the last few months I have had 2 EKGs, a 24h Holter Monitor, 2 blood pressure checks, full blood count, cholesterol test, and a chest x-ray. All tests have come back as perfect. According to these tests, theee is nothing wrong with me and in the words of my doctor, I am perfectly healthy.My girlfriend and I have just statted the Couch to 5K spp, and have just completed day 2. As I was jogging today, I got mild aching in my left neck, a slight but sharp pain in my far left pec, and a bit of mild back pain in my upper left back. This freaked me out. My girlfriend and I are doing this because we live a very sedentary lifestyle and we want to be more active. Other than sporadically over the last few weeks, I have not really jogged or exercised in years. The logical part of my brain tells me this is why I am having aches and pains while running. Thr anxious part is telling me that unless I have an echo stress test, something could have been missed.This is so incredibly tiring. Anyone else have similar experiences?"
none,"Hi everyone. So, I have not actually seen a neurologist, but I assume I have BFS, coupled with some pretty bad health anxiety.I assume I have BFS because I am 25 with no family history of *** or associated illnesses. So I understand the chances of having it are unlikely at best. But I get muscle twitches in both thighs, feet, calves, hands, stomach and base of my throat on occassion. Some weeks I get em all over like this, other weeks I get em mainly in one limb.The reason I haven't visited a neuro is because of my health anxiety. I am actively trying to address it. I saw my GP for whatever ailment on average probably a couple times every month or two last year, so it was getting out of hand. And with health anxiety, when we seek medical dpecialists, we are really just feeding the anxiety, even if it makes us feel better temporarily.So with that said, the twitching alone wouldn't really bother me. But my left arm is a bit off. I get aches and pains in my elbow and bicep. But most notably, I feel weakness and clumsiness in my hand. Grip seems to be fine, but the hand tires quickly, for example when typing or playing Xbox. It doesn't stop me from doing those things, but I notice it. I understand thay clinica weakness really is the inability to do basic things like button a shirt or hold a mug, but I am still nervous. It is worth noting that I have had these symptoms sibce September/October 2019 - so 6-7 months. The twitching has been constant, with some quieter periods and is usually only when I am seated or laying down. The hand weakness comes and goes for a few weeks at a time.Does anyone else get these symptoms? The only thing that helps me calm down a bit is that it does come and go. It might feel like this for a couple weeks, then I will forget about it for a couple weeks, then it will return.Thanks."
none,"I have been on PPIs for a year and a half now. First I was on Pariet for abour a year and have switched to Nexium 40s as the Pariet stopped working and I developed gastritis. I have not been able to find long term success with low PPI dosage yet. I have tried a couple of times to ween down onto a low dose 3-7 times a week, but this usually stops being effective after a few weeks. I am also very aware of long term PPI use and while I don't feel in the risk zone yet, I would like to look into alternatives. I would say I get overall quite mild symptoms (occasional heartburn, but prettt constant indigestion when I am off medocation). And with low PPI dosage not being effective, I am not super optimistic about H2 Blockers.So all this rambling to ask: has anyone with persistent and moderate symptoms found long term relief with a daily H2 Blocker like famotidine, in combo with Gaviscon UK?Thanks A hopeful GERD-sufferer"
none,"A while back, like many of us do, I was freaking out about MND/ALS. I developed muscle twitching in my legs, arms, stomach and in other places too. But, I did the research, asked the questions, went to thweapy and discovered my chances are so slim being a 25 year old with no family history thay it wasn't even worth worrying about.But, it has started again. The fear. I never stopped twitching, but what has got me now is I noticed a muscle imbalance in my arms. My whole left arm is smaller and weaker than my right arm. This makes sense, I try to rationalise. I am right handed. But I begin to notice that I drop a lot of things with my left hand. I have noticed this ovet the last few months. But my girlfriend says I have always been clumsy. We have known each other since we were teenagers. She says she cannot see a difference in my arms.So ladt night, I start doing bicep curls with my left arm. I figire ig it is a muscle imbalance, surely a few months of regular bicep curls will catch it up. I did 4 or 5 sets of 10 reps of 6kg. I dont go to the gym, but I did a couple years back and at the time could curl 15s. The 6s were a struggle for my left arm. Today, my arm is clumsier still. I rationalise this is due to it being worked and fatigued from the curls, but it is noticibly more difficult to handle my phone with my left. I start to worry about developing clinical weakness. Have I already? Probably not, but how would I know. Even playing my xbox seems slightly trickier than usual with my left hand. Still easily doable, but a little awkward. Again, my arm is clearly fatigued from the curls and I am anxious, so I am fixating.... but I still cannot help but worry.This is my inner monologue. Constantly. I feel sick from it. It is about 5.5 months since my first onset of 'symptoms'. I am counting down the days to that magical 9 month mark, as I figure if my life hasnt changed much, then I am likely fine.Would lovr to chat and share experiences in the comments. If you like."
none,"As an additional extra question, what would be your tunner up album and why did it not quite make that top spot?I found this so, so difficult. My favourite In Flames song is 'Only For The Weak', but Clayman is not my favourite album. So it sucks having to choose against listening to Only For The Weak forever.My choice is Whoracle because it exemplifies that classic heavy, but melodic sound of In Flames. Songs like Jotun, Episode 666 and Gyroscope are examples pf some of, in my opinion, the best melo-death songs ever written. My runner up is a little out of left field, but 'A Sense of Purpose' has really grown on me over the years. I hated it when I first heard it and felt it represented In Flames decline. But now, I find it has a lot of 're-listenability'. Songs like 'Disconnected' are easy listening, but still have that classic In Flames energy. And 'The Chosen Pessemist' is one of my all time favourites. It didn't quite make that top spot, thugh, because it is really a transitional album for In Flames, and so while I really like it, it does suffer from a lacl of classic Anders vocals."
none,"Hi all, I guess I wanted to start a discussion about the long term risks of PPIs and peoples thoughts on the risk vs benefit of these drugs. I know this has been discussed before, but I was hoping to get a wide vsriety of thoughts in one location.For context, I am 25 and have been on PPIs since January or February of 2019 -- so about a year and a half. Now, I know this is not long term use yet, but I have tried to ween off the medication on two or three occasions, but to no avail. Indigestion symptoms always come back. So, this leads me to believe that I am kind of stuck with this medication for the long haul, as I suspect my doctors would not be keen on a nissen fundo as my condition is not terribly severe when medicated.I have read thst long term PPI use is linked to heart disease, stomach cancer, kidney disease as well as a host of deficiencies. So I am left wondering if I have to weigh up my chance of developing BE and/or esophageal cancer with possibly developing these other things. I intend on discussing this with my doctor, but I would like to wait until COVID has settled down.So, with that, what are peoples thoughts? Does anyone have any inside information? Has anyone been on long term PPIs with no problems? And long term users WITH side effects?Thanks in advance for any responses."
none,"I am 25 and male. I have been twitching since september 2019. It started in the muscle just above my left knee, which accompanied leg aching. The aching was constant for months and only began to settle with time and minor physiotherapy, which treated me for referred pain from my back.As the months progressed, I noticed more twitching in my thigh, calf muscle, right leg as well, stomach, and arms. Though the twitching is mainly in my legs.I began to notice weakness in my left arm, particularly in my hand. It is hard to describe, but just feels off. My left hand is clumsy, lacks dexterity and feels awkward to hold some things. I also get aching pain in my elbow, left bicep and shoulder.I bought a grip strength weight - the ones you squeeze together. I seem to be able to do the same amount of reps on both hands on the heaviest setting, though my left struggles a little more.I started paying attention to my asymmetry. My left arm is smaller. My left arm aches. It gets tired faster. My left wrist looks smaller than my right - less 'full' if that makes sense. I spend so much time during the day looking at my arms and my hands, trying to decide if my weakness is just in my head and if I simply have a muscle imbalance. I test myself to see if I csn button my shirt with only my left hand - I can, but it takes a while and is awkward.I try and remind myself that I am right handed and don't lift weights, so of course my dominant arm will be bigger. My girlfriend tells me that her left hand is useless and that it is normal. But I have been experiencing these symptoms on and off now for 5.5 months and even though I know I have health anxiety, and that at my age the chance of 'you know what' is astronomically small, I can't help but be scared.I know you can't diagnose me, but I guess I just wanted to vent and to chat and to hear peoples experiences."
none,"I have average aim. Some days I hit my mark spot on and get on a roll. Other days I am off and missing my mark. When I look at my stats, I have 19% accuracy. I feel that I eould do significantly better if my aim improved and I could hit headshots most of the time. When I am firing, I often hit torso first.

none,"24mMedications: 40mg Nexium daily for GERDWeight: 74.4kgHeight: 179cmRecent medical history:Saw my GP for occasional shortness of breath and chest pain. Had a clear chest xray, 2 clear ECGs, good bloods including CBC and cholesterol and good blood pressure. I have also completed a 24 hour holter monitor, but do not have the results for this back as of yet.For this post, it is relevant that I am not an athlete and only in the last month or two have I begun doing mild exercise (e.g. 30 minute walks 3-5 times per week).My doc switched me from Pariet to Nexium, which has mostly taken care of the chest pain, so that seems to have been reflux related. However, I have noticed that my resting heart rate has been dropping to beyween 52bpm and 59bpm. I have only ever noticed it get down to 61 in the past, so this surprised me.I mostly notice this at night before I go to sleep, I suppose qhen I am at my most relaxed.

none,"I have posted in here before regarding my heart fears. At this stage, I am unsure what I am fearful of.My prevailing symptom is what I recognise as shortness of breath, but, it is just this kind of flutter at the base of my throat that makes me splutter and cough, then goes away. I might get it intermitently for about an hour, then it is gone for a day, or sometimes it is gone for weeks, or sometimes I get it everyday for a few days.I have had the following tests:ECG (5 in the last 3 years, 2 of them being in the last 2 months)Blood preasureCholesterolFull blood countKidney bloodsChest xray Spirometry (lung capacity) Holter monitorAll of these tests have ckme back as normal or better than 'normal'. The only one I dont have results for is the Holter Monitor, but assuming that is normal, I guess I am in the clear? I am wondering if it will show PVCs, but the shortness of breath didnt occur while I was hooked up to it, so what did it miss potentially?Doctor at this point isnt concerned and is outting it down to my anxiety, but I get the symptom at random, even when I am not anxious.I guess I am doing the classic HA thing of wondering if they missed something. What if only an echocardiogram would show what is actually going on?I am frustrated I guess. Can anyone relate?"
none,"Hi all. Does anyone have experience with PPIs decreasing in effectiveness over time, or even going through periods where they work less effectively than usual?I have been tqking Pariet (rabeprazole) for a year and a half now, cycling between 10mg/day and 20mg/day depending on how I am feeling. Recently in the last 3 weeks or so I have developed indigestion and chest discomfort despite being on a high dose. I was also under the impression that Pariet was one of the strongest PPIs on the market. So this is surprising to me given I have had no issues with it before.I have actually become nervous and wondered if it was actually a heart issue. But, I realise given I am young (25) and have a GERD diagnosis that this is likely the culprit.Any ideas?"
none,"This is really just a discussion post and also an invitation to anybody who would be down to party up in some Domination.I played my first games of Domination as a part of a party the other night and it completely changed the gaming experience.Usually, when I play solo, or even with just one mate, I do okay. Usually I average between a 1.0 and 1.8 K/D in any given game. My overall K/D is 1.38 atm (and getting higher). Now, I know KD is not a big deal in objective games, but I am also an objective player and I usually finish with anywhere from 3 caps to 10 caps depending on how useless my team of randoms is. So I always try to balance K/D with playing the objective. I also usually only hit my streaks once per game and sometimes don't even get my VTOL.When I partied up, though, it was like my whole gaming experience changed. For one, everybody knew HOW to actually PLAY the gamemode and so we were able to maintain map control for the entirety of each game. This meant that I naturally died less because it was so much easier to predict enemy movement when I wasn't having to constantly change pace and direction because my team had triple capped, or ignored B and capped A and C. Ended up in each game with top 3 kills in the team and the least deaths in each game. I also hit all my streaks multiple times in each game. Plus, it was so much more fun when everybody was making call outs and communicating about enemy movements. Obviously I am gonna party up with these guys again, but, if anybody out there hasn't got a party but they'd be down to play - hit me up! I want to play like this as often as possible."

I was diagnosed with GERD and grade b esophagitus in January 2019 via Upper Endoscopy after a month of chest pain and indigestion (no heartburn).I was put on a high dose of Pariet (rabeprazole) for 8 weeks to heal the inflammation. After stopping the medication, I had rebound acidity, and had to go back on it. Throughout last year I spent many months doing my best to taper off of the medication. The closest I can seem to get is 3 10mg tabs per week, but within a couple weeks of this routine, I always begin to feel discomfort again.Alongside thid I have had this symptoms I can describe only as shortness of breath since about 2017 now. It comes on suddenly, and it is like I just miss a breath or two, then have to cough and all is well again. It does seem to hapoen more when I am anxious. Anyway, a month ago I went to a GP about it and he gave me a chest xray, 2 second ECG, tested blood pressure and ordered a CBC/FBC and cholesterol blood tests. He also checked my lungs via a spirometry. All came back glowing apparently. It was around this time that my chest pain and discomfort returned, despite being on a high dose of Pariet. Despite having these tests and the doc saying there is nothing wrong with my heart, and despite having a GERD diagnosis at 24. I can't stop worrying about heart problems. Hell of you check my reddit post history you'll see that.I guess I just wanted to know if any other sufferers get the same concerns? Part of me wants to get an echo stress test from a cardiologist, but the other part of me says this is a waste of time and money."
none,"Why is it that right when we need anxiety to back off, it slaps us the hardest?We are in the midst of a global emergency the likes of which most of us have never seen. People are scared, people are sick and people are dying. And yet, I feel guilty vecause I can't stop worrying I have heart disease.I am 25. I have had ECGs, basic bloods (including cholesterol), blood pressure tested and a chest xray. All normal. And yet, because I get chest discomfort (sometimes brought on by food, other times by exercise), and because my arm has been aching (it is worth noting this arm has given me trouble for years), I cannot stop freaking out about having heart disease. I want a stress test, but know it is likely a waste of time and money.Based on above tests, my GP says my heart is great and I am very healthy. But that evil voice creeps in: what if he missed it? What if it could only be caught on echo?Two nurse friends have told me that the bloods would have caught heart disease and I am fine. But I can't stop.And I feel guilty because I am likely not even sick. F*ck.Anyone relate? Offer some support? Experience? Or if anyone else wants support. Post below."
none,"I have had bouts of seeing a bit of bright red blood on my TP for 5 or 6 years now. I had a colonoscopy done in January 2018 to check it out. Nothing scary, just some 'small hemmeroids'. I have continued to get blood on TP since. But now twice in the last year or so, I have had blood not just on the TP, but also a little coating some of the stool. Not a lot, just a tiny bit. But this seems like more bleeding than I have experienced before.My Dr isn't concerned as he says hemmeroids explain it, so I am not due for another colo until 2023. But I am wondering if this is worth investigating. To be fair, it doesn't seem to be getting more common or any worse.I have had a low fiber intake as of late and not been sticking to my diet, so my BMs have been on the loose side.Any similar experiences?"
none,"I have been playing Warzone a bit now and feel that I have an okay handle on decent strategy - seeking out contracts, getting the high ground, saving money to buy the goodies etc. And I have mananged a couple of 5th place finishes and a 7th place finish. Most of the time, though, I end up going out either early before I have had a chance to establish myself or relatively late, but without too much action.While I am by no means an amazing player, I can hold my own in gunfights. So, I am getting frustrated having to play with randoms who seem to have no clear strategy and are not willing to communicate with the squad via mic. Unfortunately, I don't know too many people who play the game, so can't form a full squad of my own. To avoid the annoyingness of teammates who either charge in guns blazing before tsking the time to figure out the space, or teammates who insist on camping in the outer rim the whole time, any suggestions on solo strat? Anybidy had any solo wins?"
none,"The title says it all. I hosted our regular game this week. Usually when we play I stay sober. Usually when we play i make it to the top 4, and iy is not uncommon to be in the final 2. And I have won my fair share.This time however, I had a few to drink, made some poor chpices, bought back once - we can buy back once if we go out early - and then squandered that playing too aggressively. Now I am sitting on my couch playing video games while the lads finish the poker game. 😂Not my finest hour. Can anyone relate? I need some sob stories to get me through this difficult time."
none,"So, I have a question...Has anybody else found that losing often gets blamed on the winning team 'camping'?While I am aware that camping is pretty rampant in this game, it seems kind of salty to blame every loss on it. For example. Earlier I played a game of Hardpoint on Grazna Raid. My team won by a considerable margin. I, along with two other players had over 2 minutes on the HP and we finished top of the scoreboard. I had something like 30 kills and 10 deaths, so decent, but nothing crazy. I spent a lot of time on the objective and when I wasn't, I was picking off enemies around the objectives and protecting my team mates who were on the objective. I didn't do great streaks wise. I managed 1 cruise missile, 1 vtol and 1 chopper gunner early and then only ever really got 2 or 3 kills at a time for the rest of the match.Then, when the team wins, I cheer over the mic, and some dude on the other team calls me 'the biggest camper ever'. While I thought this was funny considering I hadn't camped at all during the game, it was just the latest in a long line of losing teams calling the winning team campers.Anyone else finding this? If so, why do you think it is? Just thought this could make for an interesting discussion."
none,"I have been treating my GERD successfully with Pariet for a ywar and a bit now. But this week, despite upping my dosage to the max, I am getting CONSTANT indigestion and chest discomfort. It is definitely worse after eating, but it is always there. I don't understand what could be causing it or why it would be playing up.Does anybody else get this happen while on medication? Is this the kind of thing people get bouts of and then it settles down? Does this warrant a trip to my PCP/GP? Advice and shared experiences very welcome! Thanks."
none,"Hi all. I am nearly 25 and was diagnosed with grade b erosive esophagitus and signs of GERD after having an endoscopy in January of 2019. I went on a high dosage of rabeprazole to heal this, and while I never did a follow up endoscopy, my symptoms did go away. When I tried to go off the medocation, symptoms returned, and I have been on the medication ever since, at varying dosage levels.Just in this last week, i have been developing indigestion symptoms again, so I upped the dosage in the last two days to no improvement.Seeing as I have had np follow up endoscopy, I am a little worried. I assumed that as long as I took the medication and was symptom free, then I was pretty much all good. However, I qm wondering if BE could have been dilently developing. I am currently set to have a follow up endoscopy in January 2021, but am wondering if I should wait that long, or follow up now.I have read on here that some people were diagnosed with BE at my age or younger and I didn't even know that could happen! I only ever developed my first reflux symptoms a few weeks prior to my doagnosis.Thanks."
none,"So, Ive been to my doctor recently with shortness of breath and some chest pain (though I do have GERD, so the chest pain could easily be that). It is usually very fleeting and makes me a cough a little bit, but does not last long. Sometimes it comes on randomly, sometimes after eating, sometimes with exercise. I cant pinpoint a clear trigger.Anyway, doc listens to my heart and says it sounds good. I have an ECG for like 2 seconds, and he says its good (for those 2 seconds it listened to anyway). He has also given me a script to organise a Holter Monitor if I want to and I had a chest xray. I have not heard back from him regarding the xray, so I assume nothing scary.Anyway, assuming I get the holter monitor and it is normal. And assuming the chest xray and bloodwork is normal. Considering the ECG (plus the other 2 I have had in the last 2 years) was normal and considering he listened to my heart and said it was normal.This sounds so stupid, but...Can I pretty much rule out heart disease? Or is a stress test necessary ro totally rule it out. I realise this isn't askdocs, but I don't like posting there..."
none,"A few months back I posted here about the importance of gathering evidence. It picked up a little traction and was well received. But I have to say, I am finding it tough to follow my own advice. The advice given to me by a professional.I am currently in the process of having a chest xray, spirometry, blood tests and possibly a holter test. All for what I think is shortness of breath, but coukd be nothing.I was worried it was my heart. Now after doing the exact thing we all know NOT to do, checking Dr Google, I'm worried I have lymphoma.I am now worried I have lymphoma because my doc said I had slightly enlarged lymph nodes on my neck during his quick exam1. I looked it up. Lymphoma listed enlarged lymph nodes, shortness of breath and coughing as symptoms. All of which I have. Now, despite not having night sweats. Despite not having unexplained massive weight loss. Despite not having decreased appetite. Despite not having visibly swollen lymph nodes. Despite having had an abdominal CT mid last year, which showed nothing. Despite having a lumbar MRI last year, which even though it was for my back, picked up nothing else of note.Despite all of these things, add to which I am not yet 25 and in otherwise good health with no family history of lymphoma, I somehow am now fearful I have lymphoma BUT feel too stupid to even bring it up with my doc, because deep down I KNOW that I do not have enough symptoms for a doctor to even immediately consider lymphoma as a cause.In a matter of minutes I went from being anxious about my heart health, to being anxious - once again - about cancer.Just had to vent. Looking for support.Surely when the chest xray and bloods come back normal, this should mean lymphoma is not on the cards...Sorry for any typos. On my phone."
none,"25, male.PPI for acid reflux.No other medications. As far as I know, I am healthy.I have been concerned for a long time that I have had voxal nodules or growths brought on from (a) being the vocalist in a heavy metal band as a teen and (b) being a teacher as an adult.I have never done anything about it, though. I get a sore throat quite quickly when using my voice strenuously, but the last few months have really made me want to get checked out:end of last year I had a globus sensation for a few weeks and a sore throat. That went away, but at the beginning of this year for the last couple weeks I have had a slightly hoarse voice, tickle in the bottom of my throat (that squishy bit above the chest and below the throat), which causes me to dry cough quite constantly each day.It shoukd be noted that I have returned to teaching after the christmas holidays, so my voice is just getting bqck into talking a lot more than usual.I have an appointment with my PCP in two days to discuss, but thought I would ask here. If my suspicions are correct and I have got vocal nodes or even polyps from vocal strain, coikd these have or xould they in the future develop into cancerous growths? Or are these kinds of growths specifically non cancerous?Thanks."
none,"It sounds so silly. But I honestly can't. And I can't tell where my anxiety ends and where a real sumptom begins.For a few years now I occasionally get these brief bouts of shirtness of breath. Like suddenly I am out of breath and it is hard to talk and it makes me need to cough a lot. In 2017 I went to my GP because I mistook it for heart palpitations. I had an ECG, which was normal and that was it. It had happened a few times since, but not often. I have also had another ECG about a year ago for when I was having chest pain. Came out normal and turned out I had GERD and esophagitus. Now I seem to be getting it more often, but it isn't nearly as bad as it was that time I can remember back in 2017.I wouldn't say that I struggle to breathe, nor do I feel chest tightness. I just kind of get this splutter and have a need to cough for a second. And the bottom sort of squishy bit of my throat tickles. Then it is kind of over. I do suspect I have vocal nodes from my job and being in a band when I was younger and wonder if these coukd be the cause.But because of my health anxiety I cant help but worry it is my heart. It makes me scared to eat junk food like McDonalds or pizza because I irrationally think that this fatty meal could send me over the edge.Anybody have anything similar?Cheers."

I have tried adding 10g of psyllium hudk to a glass of water before bed the last two nights and while it does seem to bulk thongs up and make them easier to pass... I am also pooping a lot. I have pretty mild IBS, so I am not used to being in an out throughout the day.

I have looked on Google but cannot find anything in my area that is in my price range.I am a 25 year old guy who has a background in junior tennis. I play occasionally with my dad now, but have little actual experience other than 7 years when I was a kid. Very little has stuck bar the basic mechanics of ground strokes. I am very much a novice, but know how to hit a ball.I am looking for a weekly arrangement and am happy to pay for court hire if a free court is unavailable.

none,"I have been doing well the last 2 or 3 months. I was on holidays over the new ywar and settled into a nice relaxing hokiday rhythm. Sleep in until 10, wqtch Netlfix and read all day, go to bed at 1 or 2am. Then I had to go back to work.And, like always, I struggled to sleep that last night before going back. Didn't worry me. But the more I lay awake, the more I noticed my heart beat. It seemd stronger, more pronounced than usual. I could feel it pound. But, whenever I measured the heart rate, it was fine. Between 60 and 70bpm.This happened the last 4 nights straight. When I go to bed, suddenly I am aware of my heart beat and its keeping me up. Hasn't worried me during the day until now. Now my heart rate is elevated. Between 85 and 100bpm. I know thwy say that anything from 60 to 100 is normal, but this is high for me. The more I think about it, the more I check, the faster it gets and the more aware of it I am. I know deep down that there is a 99.9% chance it is all anxiety and sleep related. But the anxiety is rearing its ugly head and I cannot help but wonder: what if? What if I am on the cusp of a major cardiac episode? What if I have a murmur? Are theae palpitations? Or am I just suddenly more aware of my heart beat than I was before because of anxiety? It's difficult to think about. I have a friend who was experi3ncing heart palpitations. Turned out he had a major heart defect and needed major, open heart surgery and an mechanical valve. I would be lying if I said that didn't prey on my mind.So to summarise: storng, beating heart most notable at night when laying down. Keeps me awake. Heart rate elevated today. Won't seem to go down. Scared. Anxious. Over it."
none,"Male, 25 years old, caucasion. Currently on 10mg per day pariet for reflux. I do have health anxiety, which is important to acknowledge. I am not super worried about this, but it is weird and I'll bring it up with my GP when I see him in a couple days.I have been having troubke sleeping as I am back at work but still in holiday body clock mode. I noticed a few nights ago, the last night before going back to work, that as I was layong awake unable to sleep, my heart beat felt heavier and more pronounced than I had ever noticed before. It was stopping me from sleeping because I couldn't ignore it. I would just about slip off to sleep and then I would feel a massivr thump and be awake again. This has continued for the last 3 nights since.Now, because I do have anxiety, I was using my phone to check my heart rate constantly. Mostly it seemed to be sittong normally around 64-72 bpm. It did jump up to maybe 90 or 95, but I put this down to getting anxious. So this confused me, because it felt as though my heart beat was different or stronger, but my rate was still low for the most part.I also do not really notice this during the day.My suspicion is it is mostly anxiety related, but I wanted to ask: is it usual to feel the heart beat more strongly or more pronounced qhen laying down quietly? I guess due to calm conditions? Or does this sound strange?Thanks."
none,"\*\* *As this is a long story, I will be extra grateful to anybody who reads it all and has feedback. It is unfinished at this stage, and I suspect the current 2700 word count will eventually expand to about 6000. It began as just the hospital scene, which I posted on its own a while back. Thanks to helpful feedback in the comments, I was able to use that as a starting point for this much larger and what I hope to be interesting, personal story.* \*\*It's okay, Lis,” Jordan said, keeping his eyes planted firmly on his wife. We'll figure it out.” What he couldn't tell her was that he didn't believe it himself. His stomach churned at the thought of burdening her with such pain. So, he lied with his eyes; begging her to heed his words.I know,” Lisa said.Just think good thoughts. We'll get there.” Jordan reached out and took his wife's hand, squeezing. They were cold; lonely. Her thumb nails were chewed and uneven, the result of an old, nervous tick rearing its head. All he wanted was to reassure her; make her believe it would all work out. He never intended to be the source of her pain, in fact, it was supposed to be his role to comfort her; to protect her. He was supposed to bring her joy, but lately that seemed to be the one thing he couldn't do.I'm just scared that when I get the test, it'll be bad news.” Lisa looked at Jordan. The creases around the edges of her eyes were deeper than usual and her nose was red. This had become a regular occurrence, but Jordan wasn't desensitized. If anything, the more he saw her cry, the more it broke his heart.What if they say *never*?” she asked. What will we do then?”Jordan's insides screamed. It took everything he had not to throw a dining room chair across the room and into the mirror. He wanted to watch it shatter into millions of pieces and scatter across the room so that he could walk on the broken glass. It seemed like the only thing painful enough to distract him from reality. Staring into Lisa's eyes, he felt his mouth hanging open, unable to speak. Words seemed suddenly unattainable, blurry and just out of reach. Then, the phone rang.Jordan looked down to see his mobile vibrating on the table. The caller ID read: *Dad*. He saw his chance to escape the conversation and gave Lisa an apologetic smile. She nodded, giving him the okay to answer and squeezed his hand before leaving the table and disappearing into the kitchen. Jordan collected the phone, swiped the green button to the left and lifted it to his ear. Hey, *Martin*,” he said, hoping his dad would take the bait.Don't call me that.” His dad's voice was uneven; rough. There was no banter, no jokes. It wasn't right.Sorry, Dad. What's up?”Matey, it's Grandpa.”Jordan furrowed his brow and inhaled before responding. What about him?”He's not okay. Cancer.” For the second time in two minutes, Jordan found himself lost for words. It didn't make any sense, he thought. His dad always used to say his grandpa was *fit as a fiddle made of steel*. The man ate germ meal and steamed broccoli for breakfast, lunch and dinner. *It didn't make sense.*He's having an operation to remove a large tumour from his brain,” his dad continued. We should visit him before he goes in.”Yeah, of course.” Jordan stuttered through his response. When?”Tomorrow. I'll see you and your brother at four o'clock outside the Wesley.”Do you need me to call Kurt?”No. It's done.”Right. See you tomorrow.”Bye, matey.”The phone disconnected and Jordan stood in stunned silence. The world felt quieter; less chaotic. But, much darker. His grandpa was lively and charismatic in his old age; the life of the party. That image immediately began to fade, only to be replaced with hollow stillness.What was that?” Lisa called from the kitchen.That was Dad.” Jordan tried to swallow the lump in his throat, but it only seemed to get larger. Grandpa's sick. You'll have to get the test on your own tomorrow.”Lisa reappeared from the kitchen. Is it serious?”Jordan turned to look at her and nodded slowly.\*\*\*Outside the Wesley Hospital, Jordan watched his brother take a long draw from his cigarette. Clamping it between his fore and middle fingers, he pinched his eyebrows together in what looked like intense concentration, before blowing out the smoke and gazing into the distance. It was funny, Jordan thought, how all smokers seemed to suck on their cigarette in exactly the same way.So, cancer,” Kurt said, that's shit.”Jordan frowned and let out a small chuckle. His brother always had a knack for thoughtless thoughtfulness. It was charming in a way. Reminded Jordan of the beauty to be found in simplicity.Yeah. It's shit,” he agreed.Jordan had always found it difficult to talk with his brother. An ocean of difference separated them, often too expansive to swim and too murky navigate. Kurt had always been into heavy metal and horror movies, while Jordan was more interested in sport and politics. They were brothers, but they'd never really been friends. Of course, it hadn't helped that, growing up, they fought like brothers.Jordan had always been good at poking the bear, like the time he found one of Kurt's cigarette filters on the floor of the living room and, even though he knew exactly what it was, decided it best to pretend otherwise and show it to their mum. Jordan marvelled at his own genius that night, taking great pleasure in his brother's admonishment and indefinite grounding. The look in his mum's eyes had always stuck with him, though, as he was sure it had with Kurt. Looking into them was like being pulled into a black hole, lost forever within an expansive and ever painful nothing. He'd thought it best to make sure those eyes were never directed at him.But, like any self-respecting older brother, Kurt would reciprocate to Jordan's provocation. One time, after Jordan had stolen his Play Station controller, Kurt chased him under the house and guarded the only exit with an enormous stick. Too scared to get close and too stupid to apologise, Jordan had cowered in the corner of the room until their mother had gotten home. Thinking he was finally saved; Jordan screamed for his mother at the top of his lungs. Ironically, it was then that he faced that which he'd feared so much.They were both grounded.A stiff breeze forced Jordan's hands into his jean pockets. Looking at Kurt, he was both jealous and impressed by his brother's ability to ignore the cold. There they were, standing in ten-degree weather, and Kurt was wearing a black tank top and cargo shorts, tapping his foot to an imaginary beat as he smoked his Winny Blue. His nonchalance was awe-inspiring.So, how's up north?” Jordan asked, hoping to break the uncomfortable silence.It's fine,” Kurt said, taking another draw from his cigarette. Hot. Sticky. My air-con's shit.”That sucks.”Oath. Mining work's tough too – two weeks on, two off. I can never quite get settled.”Sorry to hear, man. I'd hate that.” Jordan scrambled for another discussion point. How'd you get down so quick? Dad only called me yesterday afternoon.”He got onto me about ten in the morn' yesterday. I flew down early today. Had lunch in the city.” Kurt took one final draw from his cigarette before dropping it to the cracked pavement and stomping it out. Then, without pause, he pulled the pack from his back pocket and lit another. How about you?” he asked, How's Lisa?”Jordan gave his brother a quick smile, doing his best to mask his apprehension toward the topic. Yeah, she's good. We're good.” Kurt looked at him as if to say, *that was convincing.*Good to hear, mate. Did you know about Grandpa?”Jordan was glad his brother had moved on. Nah. Didn't even know he was sick. You reckon Dad's known for long?”Kurt took his last draw from his cigarette, dropped it to the pavement next to his first, and stamped it out.We can ask him ourselves. Here he is.” He motioned behind Jordan.Their father walked towards them. His posture was slouched, and he had dark circles under his eyes. He looked like he hadn't slept in days. His hollow smile was worn thin and a five o'clock shadow painted his jaw in grey. It looked wrong; incorrect. Martin Alexander was a man of rigid, unwavering routine. Every morning he got up at six, brushed, shaved and showered in that order. He ate the same breakfast every day; one whole orange, sliced in half, one cup of coffee and two slices of wholemeal bread with vegemite. Whenever he left the house, he had to check that all the windows were closed, all the power points turned off and every door was locked. Twice. The man was like a machine. Programmed to perform the same tasks in the same ways every day. Seeing just one of these routines broken made Jordan feel uneasy. Martin Alexander with facial hair didn't look like Martin Alexander; rather he looked like Bizarro Martin. Dark Martin. Martin from another world. Another reality. A reality Jordan didn't want to know about because it was obviously darker than this one.Hello, boys,” Martin said as he approached. The brothers glanced at one another before hugging him.He'll be right, you know,” Martin said.Jordan and Kurt looked at each other and grimaced. Yeah, Dad. We know,” Jordan said, placing his hand on his father's shoulder, and giving it a light squeeze.He's got a lot of life left in him,” Martin continued.That he does,” Kurt said.He'll have the surgery and be-” Martin paused and looked past his children's heads, avoiding eye contact, but refusing to cry. He continued, He'll-”Jordan interjected, Dad. We-”He'll be up and at ‘em again soon. I'll make sure of it.”Jordan watched as his dad tried desperately to control the uncontrollable. He'd always been like that – determined to keep everything in order. Like a marching band. Organised and predictable. Most of the time he was successful, but Jordan sensed that today would slip through his fingers.Dad,” Jordan said. Martin turned to look at his son in the eyes. We know. Let's go in.”\*\*\*The room was white; oppressive; sterile. Jordan hated it. The walls were pristine; not because they'd been prepared for visitors, but because they'd been meticulously cleaned with bleach - or some other nauseating chemical - time and again. He could smell it in the air. Their sheen was a sombre reminder of what happened there week-in and week-out. People went there to die.The sun spilled through the small window and into the dark room, trying desperately to remind everybody the world outside was still bright. Dust danced through the light and, presumably, settled across the room, decorating it in filth. Jordan chuckled to himself. It was ironic, he thought. A place kept so diligently clean was still unable to escape dust.Martin was standing next to him with his head down and his eyes closed. His arms were a straitjacket across his chest, folded so tightly, it looked as though he was struggling to breathe. Kurt was by the window, reading some medical poster that was hung on the wall. It outlined the circulatory system or the lymphatic system or some system. He was still tapping his foot to an imaginary beat.A cough from behind them disturbed the solemn silence, and they all turned in unison to stare at the bathroom door.You okay in there? Martin called; arms still locked. There was no reply. ""Dad?"" He tried again. ""You okay?"" He looked at his sons, frowned, and exhaled.Be right out, mate, Grandpa called. His voice was hollow. Sick. but still full of unrestrained enthusiasm. ""Just dealin' with the toot!""Jordan put his hand to his mouth to stifle a laugh and turned to look at his dad. A smile was haphazardly scrawled across Martin's face and he was slowly shaking his head back and forth. ""That's Dad,"" he said and shrugged.He used to call me Kurtle.” Jordan look at his brother, his eyebrows raised, imploring him to continue. You know, like a turtle.”You loved them as a kid,” Martin said, shifting his weight on the spot.Yeah. Still do. None up north, though.”Not even in the *desert* sand?” Jordan asked, his tone sarcastic and his smile exaggerated.Nah, too dry,: Kurt said, straight faced, before turning back to his poster.Without warning, the bathroom door flew open and a frail eighty-two-year-old walked out in a blue hospital gown. His grey cheeks and thinning hair were juxtaposed against his wild smile and starry eyes.Check it out fellas, they've got me in a *bloody* nappy!” Grandpa shrieked.With no other warning, he yanked up his gown to reveal a large, white adult nappy.Jordan's eyes widened and, unable to contain his laughter, he turned away from his grandpa to look at his dad.Equally amused, but twice as embarrassed, Martin protested, ""*Jesus*, Dad! Put your gown *down*."" His arms unlocked and he waved them in front of him, as if to say *we don't need to see that!*Jordan looked back at his grandpa. Martin Senior couldn't have given two shits, wiggling his hips from side to side in some kind of dance. His eyes were wide and mischievous and the wrinkles on his face creased as he smiled. Even in the face of death, their grandpa was full of life. It pained Jordan to think that he couldn't remember if he'd always been this way; if he'd always been such a kid. He hung his head, unable to recall when he'd last spent meaningful time with his grandpa.He cast his mind back as far as he could reach, but all he was able to pluck from the ocean of memories, were a few sporadic moments in which he'd ignored the man who only wanted to know him, in favour of video games, alcohol, and anything else.Jordan made his way to a chair in the corner of the hospital room and sat down. On the periphery of his vision, his dad struggled with his grandpa, fighting to get his gown down, with Kurt watching from the sidelines offering unhelpful commentary and egging his grandpa on.Jordan exhaled, pushing what remaining life was left in him out into nothingness. He could feel his muscles growing weak and his eyes becoming increasingly heavy as tears welled. The world wrapped its icy tendrils around him, pulling him in for the kill. His head pounded as it played over every moment he'd missed to actually get to know the man standing just a few feet away.Alright, Dad. Now just sit there, will you?”Jordan looked up. His dad had managed to convince his grandpa to sit down. Studying the bed, Jordan noticed a small jug attached to its side about half-filled with yellow liquid; urine. A plastic tube hung loose; disconnected. The catheter was yet another visual reminder that, even though the nappy was funny, and it was good to see him laugh, his grandpa was in a world of pain.Will you stop fussing over me?” his grandpa said. I get enough of that shit here as it is.”Martin looked unimpressed. Dad, this is serious. You need to be careful and look after yourself before the surgery.” Jordan watched his grandpa shoo his dad's concerns away like they were nothing. This, of course, bothered Martin to no end. He did little to hide it.Kurt, mate,” Grandpa began, how's up north?”Kurt began to answer him, but Martin interrupted. Have you thought about accommodation when you come out, Dad?”Jen's set the basement up.”What about care?”I don't need it. I'm *fine.*”Dad, look, you need t-”Dad,” Jordan interjected. Calm down. Leave it be.” He looked directly into Martin's eyes. They were wet and red, ready to burst. *You can't control this*, he thought, trying to telepathically communicate the sentiment to his dad. *Just leave it.*And for a second, he thought he'd been successful in communicating his message as Martin's expression appeared to soften. For a second Jordan thought that maybe his father might accept that he was unable to control just one thing. Then his phone rang, breaking their telepathic connection and breaking Martin free from his calm.Jordan looked at his phone. Lisa was calling. He felt immediately guilty that he'd forgotten where she was. What she was doing. Without him.Sighing, he said, I've gotta take this.”As he left the room, Jordan heard his father's berating continue and he shook his head to himself.Jordan closed the door. He looked in both directions, making sure nobody else was in the hall. Nothing but still silence. He didn't really know why he had to be alone to take this, but for some reason, the notion of a stranger hearing potentially life changing news felt like a violation. Looking down at his phone, he took in a deep breath and answered.Hey, Lis. What's the go?”Nothing.Lis?” He could hear muffled sobbing on the other end of the line and his heart dropped. He tried again. Lisa?”I don't know.” The words spilled out her messily.Jordan softened, So, why the crying?”I've just got a feeling, Jord.” She took a deep breath and phone fell silent once again.Lisa, are you there?”Yes.”What feeling?”Jordan-” She took another breath. -what if we never get pregnant?”\- TO BE CONTINUED -"

none,"So I am not at all a top tier player. I probably sit at the low end of the 'middle tier'. I get more kills than deaths or break even, but I also go negative my fair share. One of the things that really holds me back is my aim. Some days it's on point, most of the time it's mediocre and some days it's atrocious. Because of this, I never plan om even attempting demascus camo. But I did think that platinum for thr ARs and SMGs was worth a shot. However, now that I have tried a few different ARs, I am rethinking this. For example, the RAM-7, while great up close, I hate at mid to long range. I'm also not big on the M13. For those of you who have achieved platinum, my question is this: Based on my skill level I outlined above, wouod you say it's worth going for platinum or will it likely suck the fun out of the game? I'm beginning to think maybe just going for gold in a selection of my favourite weapons is a better idea (I already have gold M4 - who doesn't though -, gold Kilo and am well on the way to gold Famas, AUG and P90).I know this question is very subjective, but I would be interested to hear peoples thoughts. Cheers."
none,"As a preface, I love the game. And I have a love/hate relationship with SBMM. I love that it makes the game challenging and keeps me on my toes. But, I hate that it chooses skill over connection. Last night I had to make a whole new account just to locate a playable match. The connection was so bad on my main account it was unplayable. As soon as I switch to either my girlfriend's account (which she doesn't like me using) or now this new account, it's all good. Now I am concerned that as soon as I play a few decent matches on the new account, the same thing will happen.It's wirth noting that my latency was at 128 and I could not get it any lower...Has this happened to anyone else? Is there a better work around? Is it even SBMM at all?"

No jaw pain, no tired muscles and no headaches.However in the last two weeks or so, my jaw pain - particulalry on the left - has returned. I am still using my splint. Does anybody have any strategies or exercises that worked for them to alleviate the pain a little?Thank you "
none,"Hi all - I have a question.I have been slowly decreasing my Pariet (Rabeprazole) dosage from 20mg/day down to nothing over the last 3 months or so. I have now been off the medication for probably 1 or 2 weeks.I went on the medication due to a diagnosis via endoscopy at the beginning of the year of erosive oesophagitis and evidence of GERD. My symptoms had been indigestion, chest pain/pressure.In the last week or week and a half I have developed a 'globus sensation' that will not go away. I am spending my day clearing my throat and bringing up mucus and coughing. I now have a sore throat, which I put down to irritation caused by the constant throat clearing.My question is that even though I am not getting my previous GERD symptoms, I do know that globus can be a symptom of GERD. Has anybody else experienced this kind of thing? Does amynody have any remedies for globus?I would like to avoid going back onto the PPI as I know long term use can damage kidneys, although probably unlikely. I also want to avoid the doctor because I do suffer from health anxiety and am currently in therapy for this, and going to the doctor kind of sets me back in my progress if that makes sense.Thanks."
none,"Male, 24yo, caucasion, infected shave biopsy site.I have a shave biopsy about a week ago. The site got mildyl infexted so my GP gave me Bactroban Antibiotic cream for it.

Should I continue with it uncovered, or should I be covering it with a band aid?Thanks."
none,"Seeminlgy in the minority, despite the issues with the game, I do enjoy it a lot. Unfortunately for me, I play mostly objective gamemodes (HP, HQ and Dom) and many players in the random lobbies don't play the objective particularly well or willingly. Which is fine. I gwt people wanting to just smash out some streaks and objective gamemodes are easier to do that in. But it does mean less fun for me.None of my mates in the real world play MW and so I don't have a regular set of people to play with and rectify this.So, if anybody else is like me and wishes to (a) play mostly for fun/casually, (b) aren't too wrapped up in k/d, (c) enjoy strategically playing the objective in the gamemodes listed and (d) are fans of Seinfeld as my tag is a reference to the show and would be fun to drop relevant references in game too, then shoot me a message and perhaps we can play some games as a 'clan'!General clan info:At this stage, I am the sole member becuase I just added the tag last night.Casual, not competitiveMust be 18 or over.K/D not super important, but around .85ish or above is ideal.I am in Australia, so I am on usually around 4pm-6pm weekdays and throughout the day on weekends, QLD time.Again, if you are down, send me a message for the tag."
none,"Hey all, I am new to this sub - always amazed how Reddit has a sub for literally anything.Anyway, I was diagnosed with TMJ just over a year ago. Thankfully I never had migrains, but I did have a lot of headaxhes, sometimes for weeks straight, and a lot of jaw soreness.  I began with the usual treatment plan: custom night guard, custom daytime guard (wear for 6mo), 3 collagen injections over a 3 month period and 3 laser treatments over the next 3 months. The night guard took some getting used to, but after a couple of months, I slept fine. My headaches disappeared along with my jaw pain. I felt great. Now, suddenly, after about 9 months of bliss, the last couple days have been uncomfortable. My headaches are not back, thenkfully, but my jaw pain is the worst it has been. Not 100% sure it is the TMJ, but that would make sense. I have been under a lot of stress at work, combined with me suffering from terrible health anxiety, it hasnt been a great couple months.I had two 5mg valium last night as well as wearing my orthodic just to really make sure I was relaxed. The pain seems better this mprning, but not gone.My question is: does anybody, even with a night guard that is supposed to stop the muscles from working, still get sore jaw? Especially if they are stressed? Does it go away after a while?Sorry for theong post, thanks."
none,"The last week or so I have felt a constant 'lump' in the throat sensation, like there is (sorry for the grossness) a lump of phlegm in my throat. As a result I keep voluntarily coughing, bringing up saliva and clearing my throat. Add to this it's been 35C+ days here in Australia - dry heat - and so my now sore and tickling throat makes total sense... if you're rational!Of course to my health anxiety brain, there is something seriously wrong.Anyone else get this sensation? I believe when nothing else is causing it, it is called 'globus sensation'...It almost feela like I have dysphagia sometimes, but it's hard to tell as nowhere tells me what this really feels like. Maybe very occasionally I will get food stuxk in my throat for a mpment, or regurgitate it, but I can always get it back down. Sometimes water goes doqn the 'wrong pipe', but it isn't everyday. Man, anxiety is exhausting.Hopefully it goes away soon!"

My leg pain has been noticeably better, but I have been having diarrhea the last couple of days, which I believe to be unrelated to my IBS (although it could be). I am wondering if I am taking too much magnesium and if this is dangerous? Google would have me believe that, yes, it is too much. But friends and anecdotal evidence would say otherwise.Thank you."

none,"Hi everyone. This will be a long post, but I think it will also be a helpful one for those of you who are struggling to cope or have not yet had access to CBT. I am not a therapist, nor am I attempting to counsel. However, I have learned some strategies in therapy that are slowly helping me, and I thought for those who have not heard these, perhaps they could be of use. I'd like to start by saying that I do not subscribe to this sub. I did for a while, and I found that it actually fed my health anxiety. Constantly seeing posts by people who were seeking reassurance would always put a new and frightening illness on my radar. So now, I occasionally check back when I am in a deep state of anxiety. The key difference, however, between checking then and checking now, is what I'm looking for. When I used to look at the sub, it was because I too was seeking reassurance. I wanted to know what others were struggling with, if my symptoms matched up with other peoples symptoms and if I discovered a new ailment along the way, well then great, I could add another to the long list of things that would kill be before I turned 25 (next April). When I look at this sub now, however, I don't look to the posts; I look to the comments. I am not seeking reassurance, but rather **evidence**. In CBT, my therapist has been working with me on the importance of building evidence, both for AND against the disease I am concerned about at that moment. I give you an example.A snapshot of me right now:**Age:** 24  **Gender:** Male  **Medical History:** Nothing significant  **Family History:** bowel cancer and melanoma (however, these are not relevant to my current state of anxiety)  **Current symptoms:**  \- aching pain in my left leg for the last 6 weeks - am now getting pain in both legs on alternating days  \- muscle twitches (fasciculations) in both legs, primarily above the knee, but all over and in other areas of my body  \- slight weakness in my sore legs and my left arm  **Testing/treatment I have had done regarding these symptoms:**  \- lumbar MRI (clear with minor wear and tear)  \- X-Ray (left leg) (awaiting results)  \- regular physiotherapy visits, treating for referred pain from back  **What I'm afraid of:**  \- ALS/MND/MS  \- Bone cancerFor a couple of weeks I was a MESS. I was having panic attacks that I had ALS/MND. My muscle twitches were going haywire. I couldn't sleep. I was getting tingles down my leg and left arm. Then I started to actually pay attention to my therapist, and some helpful commentors on this sub. Below is what my evidence for and against all of these things looks like:**Evidence that I DO have ALS:**\- I have muscle twitches, which is a symptom of ALS  \- Muscular pain is sometimes a symptom of ALS  \- I feel some minor weakness (but nothing that stops me walking or grasping things) in my sore legs and arm.**Evidence that I DO NOT have ALS:**\- I am 24 years old - most cases of this disease occur in people over 40, and often, closer to 60.  \- I have no family history. While most cases of ALS occur in people with no family history, almost ALL cases in people below 30 or 40 are familial related.  \- Muscle twitches - while there are exceptions as with anything - are usually a later stage symptom of the disease.   \- There is very little medical study into muscle twitches because they are considered to be of little medical significance. In other words, they are SO common and have hundreds of causes (plus hundreds more that doctors likely do not know about), all of which are FAR more likely than ALS, this symptom alone means little to nothing. A quote I saw online, but cannot remember where, said, 'Remember, muscle twitches are common, ALS is not.'  \- The prevalence of ALS is about 1 or 2 in 100, 000. That's only between 10 and 20 in every 1, 000, 000. Or between 100 and 200 in every 20, 000, 000 people. Those numbers are pretty good.  \- Generally before other symptoms, people will experience clinical weakness in their limbs, i.e. unable to walk properly, unable to hold a mug. Not just tripping, minor losses in dexterity or even minor foot dragging/tripping.   \- I have been clumsy my ENTIRE LIFE. It's a running joke between my girlfriend and I about how clumsy I am.  \- the weakness and soreness in my left arm is probably from a tendinitis injury I have struggled with on and off for the last 5 years.**Evidence that I DO have bone cancer:**\- my legs hurt.**Evidence that I DO NOT have bone cancer:**\- I had a lumbar MRI come back clean, meaning nothing in lymphatic system, nothing in my spinal column, no tumours causing referred pain  \- no family history  \- I have had an x-ray and while I do not yet have the results, if they come back negative, that's about as conclusive as you can get.**Conclusion:**All we need to do is look at the evidence. I probably don't have ALS or bone cancer. It's far more likely that I have some mechanical fault in my legs or a muscular issue that will probably resolve with some physiotherapy.True, there are no absolutes in life. True, I COULD have one of these horrible diseases. Nobody on planet Earth can guarantee I or anybody else doesn't. But, the statistical likelihood of me having these ailments is so minuscule that it isn't even worth worrying about. And I know telling a person with health anxiety not to worry about health is like telling a dog not to smell another dog's butt and I'd be lying if I said this was a cure for my anxiety. It isn't. I still have low days and I still have weak moments. But what this has helped  with is coping on a day-to-day basis.I won't tell you not to Google, because I know that won't stop you. But I will say (a) limit the amount you do and (b) if you do Google, don't just search symptoms and match yours to whatever horrible thing comes up. Instead, look for **evidence.** Look for statistics in your age bracket. Look for ties to family history and hereditary links. And most of all, remind yourself that it's okay to get anxious, but it isn't okay to let that anxiety rule over you and ruin your day, week, month or existence. I hope this was helpful for those who had time to read it."

I have prettt mild IBS and it only really hits me in the mornings. I will go two or three times - urgently - every morning unless I am on a strict low fodmap diet. Now, being in the US, there is no way i am following that diet. Bring on the burgers, pizza, lobster rolls, terrible coffee, buffalo wings and everything else that is literally the worst thing for my digestive tract!Because my girlfriend and I aren't rich, we have been staying in budget studio rooms the size of walk-in closets. As such, every morning, she has been subject to my tragic ... alarm. Every morning I emerge from the bathroom, engulfed in an invisible cloud of my own stench. It wafts through the closet-sized hotel room, clinging to the sheets, the chairs, the clothes - everything. Her face turns from one of love and reverie, to one of sheer horror and pain. All I can say is that thank god we are highschool sweethearts and have been together for so long, otherwise I don't know that I would be comfortable with this shituation."

It's great for nostalgia, but not enough people are playing it so the game type choices are very limited. I am very out of the loop with games today.

About 2 months ago, I cut out gluten and dairy to see if it would help, but I didnt really know about caloric intake and so I went from eating probably over 2000 calories a day to about 1300-1600/day. As a result, I lost about 7 kilograms over that period. Now, I actually want to put some weight back on.Now I have figured put my nutrition and am eating fairly healthy. However, for about 2 weeks I have cobsistently been eating 2400 calories or more per day but have not seen an increase on the scales yet.

none,"Hi all, I am 24 yo male. I was diagnosed with grade b erosive esophagitis and GERD in January. I was prescribd 20mg Pariet (rapebrazole) twice per day to heal the esophagitis and stop the reflux. I've been taking the Pariet pretty much since then (except for a month or so when I switched to Nexium, which did not work for me at all and the reflux came back). All was fine, until about a week ago when suddenly I began having reflux/indigestion feelings after every single meal, regardless of how small, healthy or bland. It seems to be getting a little better again, but I'm not back to normal at all.My question for long-time GERD sufferers is this: even while on PPI medication, is it normal to have flare ups for a week or two here and there where the reflux and indigestion is just relentless?I don't know if it's related, but I had a cold leading up to the first day I felt the indigestion, so I was just on the tail end of it when it happened. Couold my body's immunity during that cold or extra congestion cause the extra reflux? I asked my GP, but he didn't seem to have an answer. Thanks."
none,"Hi all, I thought that in light of the recent post about victories and success stories, I would post what has been a monumental step in the right direction for me.Today I met with my GP and completed a mental health plan. He has referred me to a psychologist and I feel relieved! I've been avoiding this for so long now, but finally, I feel like maybe I can see a future without the constant fear and anxiety of disease lingering over my head. I don't know what the next few months hold, but I'm hopeful it's positive things.I will leave off by repeating the worthwhile (if not immediately helpful) advice my GP gave me today (quoted more or less): *It's all about probability. Yes - you could be sick right now, but the likelihood of that being the case is extremely slim. A plane could crash through the ceiling right now and kill us, but the chances are almost non-existent. Get out. Go hiking. Go camping. Find a hobby. Add some spontaneity into your life and try not to be such a panic artist. The more you can give yourself some perspective, the more you'll see that life is pretty good.*I know this advice seems easier said than done - but maybe he has a point? Food for thought - for all of us.Anyway, good luck and good health to all!"

none,"Hi, I'm a 24 yo male.You know how it goes: it starts with a small, niggling symptoms that doesn't go away. Then an inocuous Google search. Before you know it, it's been 2 hours and you've trauled through every possible web page and Google image and have convinced yourself that death is imminent. Over the last 5 years or so I've been convinced of bowel cancer, heart attack, DVT, brain tumour and more. A doctor told me that I've had more testing done on me than fi our average 60 year old. Colonoscopy, various x-rays, blood tests, head MRI, ultrasounds and most recently, an abdominal CT scan. All have come up negative for anything serious. And yet, I can't shake the feeling that I'm sick.My latest is Chronic Pancreatitis. I have never had acute pancreatitis. My abdominal CT scan looked normal - although I do not know if my GP was specifically searching for pancreatic issues when he ordered it. I hqve had blood works taken - although I dont know which ones specifically. All signs point to healthy. I tried cutting gluten and dairy and increasing fiber. This seemed to have tremendous impact for a couple of weeks, but then, things went back down hill. Symptoms returned.And I have real symptoms... I think?For a few years I've had (sorry for some upcoming TMI) loose stools, light or yellowy brown in colour. I never thought anything of it until now. Now in the last few weeks I've had abdominal discomfort, which comes and goes, and just in the last week or so, I have developed constant (but not debilitating) lower left back pain. All symptoms I have found out of Chronic Pancreatitis. Despite the tests. Despite the lack of family history. Despite having never experienced an acute pancreatitis attack. I cant stop Googling. I cant shake the feeling that I am sick and my life is about to change forever. The anxiety has turned up about 5 levels this weekend. I spent the whole day yesterday anxious, Googling and withdrawn. This morning I wake up eith back pain and the worst stools I have had in weeks. Been to the bathroom 3 times in an hour.I don't know what to do to combat this anxiety and I don't know what to do to combat what I've convinced myself is a chronic illness. Im sp stressed at the thought of going back to my GP because I go so often I feel like an idiot."
none,"I want to discuss some issues I've been having with Arrow lately, and also how I feel it can be revived.I wanna start off by mentioning that I loved the first two seasons of this show. Now, I'm not a comic book reader, but I do dig comic book movies and some comic book shows, and this show was kind of something new for me. It was the DareDevil (2014) of 2012. It was dark and gritty, and while it was at times a little cheesy, overall a solid and serious take on this character (again, not that I know what the original comic character is actually like).We had a strong season one followed up by an on par, or possibly stronger season 2, with a dope villain. Yes, Deathstroke could have been utilized a little better, but overall he and the season was strong.Then, season 3 hit and all of a sudden, the show hit a wall. It became cluttered and unfocused. All of a sudden we had 3x more members on Team Arrow, a villain who was barely present and a plot line that wasn't entirely clear. This was the season that I actually stopped watching for a while, stopped caring about the story and what happened to the characters. After a while I picked it back up and we had some cool episodes, but they were - for me - far and in between.Now we have season 4 and it's... disappointing. It's even less focused and its villain is weak. Again, I don't know anything really about Damian Darkh as a character, but Arrow's rendition of him is lackluster to say the least. He's a guy who wants to...uhm...huh. Do stuff? Control Star City? Obviously I know there is more of a plot than that, but it's just so all over the place.So, this is getting kinda long now, so I'll sum up:1. The show is suffering from Spider-Man 3 syndrome. So I feel like it needs to seriously cut down on it's heroes (and preferably not have them miraculously come back to life - have them stay dead). I'm thinking Black Canary/Laurel or Speedy/Thea.2. The show is lacking a strong and focused villain with an interesting plan. We need to see another hands on villain like Deathstroke. We need to feel the danger. Give us a fighter, somebody less bland than Damian Darkh.3. We need some of that season 1/2 darkness. I get it, The Flash has been successful, but that's not what Arrow is or should be.So, if you've managed to make it through my post, please, share your opinions! I'd love to hear if people share mine, or if they think I'm a knob."

none,"Hey there, so I've been wanting a tattoo for a few years, but I haven't wanted to rush into it - make sure I knew what I wanted. I've had this idea stewing for a while now though (it's not entirely original, but it'd be cool to have a different take on it):I want a tree, and as the branches extend outwards they turn into birds flying off either in different directions, or even into a kind of spiral upward. I want it to be a family tree of my immediate family, so a number of the birds will be different colours, each representing my immediate family members. I'm down for a bit of colour as I don't want it too look super Gothic or anything. I haven't got any reference images, so go wild! I would love to see some designs if anybody is willing to give it a go! Dunno if it's relevant, but I plan on getting it done on my upper arm. I'm not a muscly guy, so thatmight give you a sense of size - not sure if that matters though.Hopefully somebody will be down to give it a go! Thanks!"
none,"I have a logi circle HomeKit camera installed on my porch, and the porch also has a hue lightbulb installed. There is a really helpful setting inside HomeKit that will allow me to have the light come on automatically when movement is detected - however - The light turning automatically off after a period of time, causes the motion detector to turn the light back on instantly creating a viscous light on, off loop. Forever.Anyone know how to help get around this? Thanks"
none,"I've suffered with health anxiety for a good three years now and I'm sealing treatment for it now before it gets uncontrollable. One thing I constantly wonder about is if I was a religious person would I still suffer with health anxiety. A long time ago I believed in healing hands 🙌 and even did a class in spiritual healing. Since then I've become a far more science focused person and left all the beliefs behind me, but i wonder if I hadn't - if I thought my hands could really heal. Would I be able to placebo my away out of anxiety? If I believed a god or divine power was watching over me, would I be calmed by their” presence? Id like to know are any of you religious? Does it help?"
none,"I totally agree that the parlor social network is a pool of gross ugly people who have organised to do some truly awful things in the USA and around the world. I believe the service should be more strongly moderated or removed entirely.However...This trend of large tech giants threatening or removing the app biased on the morals” of the tech company has me very concerned. I'm not sure I like the idea of Apple, Google and Amazon dictating what is acceptable and what is not. I understand having rules for all - but my understanding is that Parlor hasn't violated any rules? I agree it should be removed but just because in this case I agree with them doesn't mean what they are doing is right. I'm putting this discussion in the should you be aloud to punch a nazi” camp. Where the answer should be yes” but for the safety and freedoms of all the law says no”. If removing services and crushing smaller apps becomes a trend like ‘canceling' people on Twitter. Eventually we will reach a point where new services can be removed for the smallest infractions or any excuse a tech giant can sell as for the social good”. I agree in this case, but are we opening the door for far more actions like this in the future?Am I wrong to be worried about this? CMV"
none,Context:Wedding was booked for 10/10/2020 early in the year we saw the writing on the wall that travel wasn't going to be possible and lots of our guests were coming from New Zealand to Australia. We decided to move the wedding to 2/10/2021 (American: 10/2/2021) and now I've discovered that's the Melbourne AFL Grand final (Like the Super Bowl for Australians). We can't change the date because everyone is booked out. Any advice on the best way to handle the situation? My future wife and I aren't very sporty and I'd say most of the guests won't care.... but I'm worried it will still have a negative impact on our special day.
none,"Re-watching the episodes, i noticed a peculiar scene where Lucifer mixes up apology gifts for the detective and Eve. He mistakingly sends eve a new photo copier, and the detective a sex doll. After the mixup  The detective asks  surely this [gift] is meant for someone else” to which Lucifer replies no - this is for us to enjoy together”. Originally I considered the idea that he did this intentionally, as some kind of joke but it's clearly a mistake because the present sent to Eve actually says I'm sorry detective”. Clearly Lucifer is trying to cover up the fact that this was not the gift intended to give her and I am interested to know what the reddit thinks. Is this a lie?"

I walk for miles and miles avoiding people whenever I can, listening to as much tech talk podcasts as I can because they seem to be the only thing that doesn't focus on the down sides of life.

I also spent 3 years as a new director in Darwin.I've always believed Australia has racism, like all countries. But for the most part I thought we were doing well, yes there is a gap (and that is not acceptable) but I thought we were doing what we could to make it better. However over the past week with the situation in the US building it has sparked discussions here at home.I'm really struggling with this public conversation. I am willing to admit most of my upbringing was in a middle class, sheltered family in the suburbs. But I did also spend three years working and living in Darwin, in the news. While there I saw some of the unfortunate conditions some of our Australian natives have to live in. I also saw the many community programs, finance support services and opportunity's rightfully awarded to our community's. So now I'm here to listen, I want to know where we are? what are the problems we haven't fixed? Am I wrong in thinking Australia is slowly making progress in the right direction? Or are we going backwards like in the US?"
none,"This is a simple cravings log.I wanted a simple shortcut that would really quickly log every time I feel snacky”. I keep this on my home screen for quick access.The idea is to have the shortcut note the time I feel snacky regardless of the day, so that hopefully in a few weeks I'll be able to recognise the times I get cravings. The way to use this shortcut is to copy the default text into a .JSON dictionary file then simply update the counter of the nearest half hour each time it's run. Then, using the app Charty the second shortcut will convert the data into a usable graph.

I have a daily checklist of tasks I must do each day.  \- take medication   \- brush teeth  .......you get the idea. I want to check those off using things NFC taps, basically if I tap my phone against my toothbrush it checks that item off the checklist. Now I've tried this in a bunch of ways but unfortunately the API ID of the task changes each day so what i'd like to do is have a shortcut search for specific words find the ID of the task with that name then check that task off. why I want to do this? If I do the task without thinking (like at 5AM when I'm half asleep) there is no need to even see the checklist item in my list... because I did it already. But if I self forgot, then the task will still be in the checklist at the end of the day and I can quickly go do it then."

none,"Hey all! I was finally brave enough to talk to my doctor about the PCOS symptoms I've been having. He took me seriously and ordered a complete blood panel and ultrasound. I had my blood test today and I already have my results. Almost everything is normal, except for my DHEA-S and testosterone levels. I cried with relief because that's a sign of PCOS. I feel like I finally have answers. HOWEVER - I stupidly went and googled my DHEA-S levels and discovered that not only are they high... they are EXTREMELY HIGH. like potentially-the-result-of-an-adrenal-tumour high. Now I'm spiralling. Any tips for dealing with health anxiety while you have results and are waiting for your doctor to follow up? I'm not sure how to deal with this. Thanks!"
none,"Hey all! I'm 25F, 5'5”, 250lbsI've been trying over the past five months to lose weight but nothing I'm doing is working. I've been tracking my food, going on walks, and the scale hasn't budged. I thought I may be underestimating calories so lately I've been cutting portions and adding in more intense exercises to my week. Still.... nothing. The scale is still the same but now I am experiencing gassiness/constipation. This has worked for me before and I've lost a significant amount of weight in the past. But not this time. The main change that I can think of is that my doctor put me on low-estrogen birth control for mental health reasons. It's helped me significantly in that regard. I didn't think however, that this could cause this many issues with losing weight. Due to Covid in my area, my doctor is not seeing patients in person. I'm going to call tomorrow to ask for hormone and thyroid tests. I also wonder about PCOS as I do have acne and hair growth on my face. I was hoping for advice as to anything else it could potentially be that I should ask to be tested for? Thank you so much!"

Was looking forward to getting back to it and losing some weight as I am getting married next year. I am not feeling confident and wanting to change. I started at 250 and as of today I am at 246. I am tracking my food, getting in exercise (or as much as I can considering gyms are still closed here because of COVID and the weather has been awful), but the weight is just not coming off. The only major thing that has changed is that I'm on low estrogen birth control now to correct a hormone imbalance, but I don't think that this should be affecting me this much. I'm feeling incredibly discouraged. Any advice to get me through this slump?"
none,"Most of my health anxiety revolves around my chest and heart. My general anxiety seems to enjoy causing chest pain which then triggers my health anxiety. I'm always worried that every pain I feel in my chest is a heart attack. Well, today I went to the eye doctor for a checkup. They have this camera that takes a picture of the back of your eye and they've just started using it on everyone, rather than just high risk people like before. My eye doctor was showing me the pictures and really zoomed in on the veins in my eyes. He pointed at them and went wow! Look how healthy these look! No cholesterol, no plaque! If you had that in your body, I would see it here. But nothing!” What. A. Comfort. I know I'll still have anxious thoughts when I feel chest pain next, but wow did it feel good to know that my chances of a heart attack are lower than my brain made me think they were!"

Today, I've noticed a very sharp pain on my left side. Around the 4th from the bottom rib at the side of my body. It feels like it's from my ribs or just behind it. It is so sharp that it takes my breath away, but it disappears within a few seconds. It's happened about 10-15 times today. I'm Googling even though I know it's bad for me (as I'm sure you can relate) and can't find anything that describes exactly where the pain is. I do realize that this is not a heart issue (which is usually the source of my HA) but my mind is still reeling and I could use some support. Any suggestions for what this could be? It's the fact that I've never experienced this before that has me worried. Thanks!"
none,"Hello! I was supposed to be cruising with NCL on March 15, 2020. On March 12, it was announced that the Canadian government advised against all international travel. We were forced to cancel our cruise that day and take the Future Cruise Credit. Less than 24 hours later, NCL cancelled our cruise and offered refunds to those with bookings still. We have to use our FCC by this March to travel by the end of 2022. With the slow roll out of the vaccines in Canada, plus our own uncertain financial situations, I would love to go on a cruise but going this soon just does not seem like a smart idea for me. Do you think NCL would give us a refund of our FCC? I would definitely cruise with them again but preferably when it's completely safe and when we're in a better financial spot. Would love some advice before contacting them. Thanks!"

I was pretty good with this until I accidentally picked at the mole that was dodgy and a scab formed. Went to the dermatologist again after a week and was just given some cream and told that it wasn't worth biopsy and I'll have a check up in two weeks. Both times the mole was checked by a PA and my HA has me convinced it's a stage 3 melanoma that's been growing downward for a year. It's been really hard for me to focus, consumed by the thought a PA misdiagnosed me twice. How do I not let this rule my life ? Both times they used a dermascope but I'm still anxiousUpdate: it seems like a new dot has appeared in my mole, should I go to the doc immediately?https://imgur.com/gallery/TriZ7Jf"

none,"I'm so tired going on a dating app and chatting with a person who doesn't lift a single finger to continue a conversation. Whenever I try talking about talking something deeper then which office character they are or what their favorite taco flavor is they immediately lose all interest. Everyone just acts like your weird if your seeking something other then a person to brag to their parents about, watch movies, and bone. When did trying to emotionally connect to people become such a foreign concept ? I just want to have one conversation where someone tries to show something deep about themselves or shows genuine interest in who I am below the surface."
none,"Hi all after seeing Fynn, the Fangbearer spoiled I made this edh deck that I think is pretty good but may need some more suggestions.

none,"Hi, I'm a rising sophomore cs major at Northeastern, and over the summer I've been trying to improve on the cs skills I've learned, and dip my toes in the deep complex pool of AI. However, every day I feel paralyzed by the amount of information and resources available to use. For example, I have been to trying to read everything I found intresting on /r/programming and the Hacker news in my free time in attempt to better my understanding of cs. However, by the time I'm done reading it all, I have no time left to do actual programming.

none,"at the end of season five I started to wonder about the faceless men and their concept of no one. If they are so keen on letting go of their original sense of self, does that mean they are all a sort of hive mind, as demonstrated when the girl transformed her figure into that of the man arya knew as jaqan hgar. Also how can they all have no sense of individuality if they all like to transform into one particular face. Doesn't the very act of preferring one face constitute individualism?"

The young mother fought hard. Neighbors heard screams.When Mary Scott missed work the next day — Nov. 20, 1969 — a friend went to her neatly kept City Heights apartment. She found furniture overturned, chairs flipped, an ashtray smashed.Scott was nude on the living room floor, her nightgown ripped off. She had been raped and strangled.It was dark outside when two detectives in suits knocked on the door of her family's Clairemont home, just shy of 51 years ago. Scott's sister Rosalie Sanz, a teenager at the time, said her parents accepted the tragic news and abruptly closed the door on the men.Sanz is now 67. Over the weekend, she received news that left her beyond thrilled”: A suspect was in custody.San Diego police announced Tuesday that they'd arrested a 75-year-old Pennsylvania man on suspicion of murder in Scott's killing. John Sipos was taken into custody Saturday at his home in Schnecksville, not far from Allentown on the eastern side of the state.Sipos remained jailed Tuesday in Pennsylvania's Lehigh County and was awaiting extradition to San Diego County. His attorney, John Waldron, said he is still evaluating how to address the extradition matter and has not yet met Sipos in person. The Pennsylvania-based attorney said the jail's COVID-19 precautions mean that his client — who he said has medical concerns, including diabetes and three previous heart attacks — faces a three-week quarantine.Police say Scott's killer left behind DNA evidence. That, coupled with forensic genealogy, helped lead them to Sipos.Forensic genealogy, or genetic genealogy, has become a go-to method for frustrated cold-case detectives since 2018, when investigators used it to identify the Golden State Killer.Genealogists try to match crime-scene DNA to relatives of the unknown perpetrator using publicly accessible DNA databases. A hit helps them create family trees in hopes of putting a name to the mystery DNA.San Diego police have had success with the sleuthing method before: In March 2019, detectives announced that they had solved the 1979 killing of Barbara Becker, a La Jolla woman slain during a midday burglary gone awry. Her young sons came home from school and found her body. In the Becker case, the suspect died in the mid-1990s.Police did not disclose many details about the Scott case, but Sanz said she was told that in 1969, Sipos was living in San Diego and had recently gotten out of the Navy when Scott was killed.This guy got to live 51 years free and easy,” Sanz said, and she got those 51 years taken from her.”In the mid-1960s, Scott married at 17 and had two girls. Within a few years, she had separated from her husband, a Navy sailor from Louisiana.The San Diego native worked as a cocktail waitress and later as a go-go dancer at Star and Garter, a club three blocks from her bottom-floor apartment on 39th Street near University Avenue. Finding child care was difficult, so she eventually left her young girls with her husband's family.Scott's youngest daughter, Donna M. Wyble, is now 55. She has one memory of her mother: being in a small bed in the apartment and seeing a cardboard fireplace, presents and a Christmas tree.Wyble's older sister, Christine, died in 1993 in a car crash. She was 25 and the mother of two boys.Wyble said news of an arrest in her mother's killing left her totally in shock.”It's unreal, because it's so many years that we wanted this solved,” said Wyble, who still lives in Louisiana. I wish my sister was here to see it.”Scott was the oldest of six siblings. Sanz was the baby of the family — Scott always called her Pumpkin” — and is the only surviving sibling. Their parents have died.Everyone loved her,” Sanz said of her slain sister. She was very sweet and big-hearted and kind of naïve for the world she was living in.”Sanz said she had been reading stories about how DNA and genealogy could help catch killers, and around the 50th anniversary of her sister's death, she reached out to a friend in law enforcement to help get her sister's folder to the top of the cold-case pile.It's good for families not to give up,” Sanz said.Figueroa writes for the San Diego Union-Tribune.Updates:6:57 PM, Oct. 27, 2020: This story was updated with comment from defense attorney John Waldron."

none,"I was diagnosed with CFS/ME back in 2008. All of the onset of my illnesses can be traced back to the same timeline, really within a month. I have (Im sure Ill forget some) CFS/ME, Fibromyalgia, Hashimotos, Hypothyroidism, IBS, Psoriatic Arthritis, PCOS, POTS/OI, Complex Sleep Apnea, and I had a heart attack in 2013. Ive spent ten years trying to figure out whats causing what because they all overlap so much. Then last year I started to have odd symptoms in my feet. I talked to my regular doctor about the pains and how cold and hot they felt, and he wanted to see if it went away on its own. So this continued until April of this year when I had enough and went to see a foot doctor (who was amazing, and showed what part of the pain was fibro and how to deal with that, and there was bursitis too, but that the pain I was talking about wasnt either of those things and sounded like nerve pain), my Rheumy who said it sounded like nerve pain, so I went to see a neurologist. I walked in, and told her the pain, how it was symmetrical, how its mainly two toes, the same ones on both feet, and how it seemed electrical in nature. And was immediately told it was long nerve neuropathy. As we treated that, and I investigate the condition to know how to manage it better, and reading here, I came across Small Fiber Neuropathy (SFN). SFN is different nerves that go all over your body and trigger all sorts of things. And I have all the segments in play with mine. It seems it explains most if not all of the odd things that didnt quite fit with the others. So I talked with her about SFN when I next went to see her. She agreed its very likely. I explained how I have a bunch of diagnosis's that typically doctors just dont believe or ignore (being a woman and having CFS can trigger so much ignorance) and that having a black and white diagnosis with objective tests would go a long way to keeping doctors from ignoring me. So we did the test for SFN. Its three small punch biopsies (3 mm) done in specific places (have to be measured out and identified) and then the punched tissue goes to special labs for the test where they count the nerve fibers. Had to get insurance auth for the test and the special out of network lab they used. But they paid. And today I got my results. Yup, have clear SFN in all three places (thigh, calf, near ankle). But the surprising part is that even with the symptoms being worse and working up my legs over time, is that its not actually starting in my feet. My results showed the thigh is the worst, then the calf the next worst, and the ankle better. So that sucks. I prefer to have diagnosis so I do go looking for answers. When we have so few answers, it helps me to have something concrete to look at and understand why this is all happening to me. But it still sucks. It really does. Im tired. So tired of it all. However, I just wanted to put that out there. I kinda feel that everything is connected. That the lack of energy being produced in the mitochondria is affecting all the systems in the body. That they arent fully functioning and replenishing systems and acting the way they should. Thats why it crosses so many systems and triggers other conditions to be extreme. Its just my opinion. But I feel that others may have the neuropathies I do and not realize it or have doctors that ignore you too. Im lucky to have this doctor. She was really great."
none,"If you are thinking of going through a divorce and/or custody case with someone abusive or already in the middle of it, check out our sister sub, /r/NarcAbuseAndDivorce. There you will find folks specifically going through the same kinds of experiences you may have or will be in the future. There is also more resources specific to the divorce and custody issues there for you. Sometimes it just helps to be with people going through these things as you. So, be sure to check it out!"
none,"We have been working towards updating the sub a bit and I was trying to ensure we have flair for everyone that fits the bill for their posts. So I started to see if what we had covered each situation by adding it to posts for a couple of days. I did add more flair options doing this. We also have had, on several occasions, posts that are graphic and detailed that can trigger folks. This is an abuse sub and sometimes we do need to convey specifics, or process them ourselves which means discussing them in our posts. So we want to be sure folks that have anything violent or graphic flaired to ensure everyone has a good experience when visiting the subs. However, as I started to check out flairs, I noticed folks using flair on their own more frequently. So, I was wondering, what do you all think about it? Flair? Yea? Nay? Need more options? Suggestions? Take this opportunity to let us know!! Tell us what you think! EDIT: Sorting by flair or searching by flair can be helpful to find specific topics you want to see too! Click on the flair to sort that way."
none,"We have had a few complaints about posts being graphic for violence, animal abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse, etc without flairs to warn readers. Given that we are all here from abuse, we want to give a heads up especially when our posts, which often need to convey information about abuse, is harsh, graphic, violent, etc. There are many flairs for options, and if you cant find one that fits well, please let us know. We will put new ones in. Thanks for making this sub great, supportive, and a resource for others going through this horrible experience. You guys are great!"
none,"Right now, I dont have any ability to pull a usertag and to tag a user in either new or old reddit. I also do not have the full listing in the header of my subs, or the karma listing next to my username. This is happening in both old and new. I know there is a flair issue which hasnt been a big problem in my subs, but right now, this seems to be happening and has been going on since I logged in about 5 hours ago. I dont see any mention of this and was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this? I logged out, reloaded the page, dumped my cache, etc but its still doing this."
none,"I have about two thirds of my traffic both for uniques and pageviews missing for 8/13. Is there an ongoing issue? I didnt see any posts here about it or anything on modnews to list it as identified and being worked on today.EDIT: Dont know why I didnt think to check earlier, but the same thing is happening on all three subs I moderate."
none,"I got this notice in my email about the @MEAction USA doing this educational contact with doctors in the US where they send you postcards that are designed by folks like us. We hand write responses and address them and mail them out. It seems communications with hand written messages get read more often then commercially produced ones. So if you have the energy to hand write names and messages, please consider helping out. You can determine how many you want sent to you and they can send you a list of providers or you can get your own names and addresses to send them to in your area.

none,"So over the weekend I had someone in my sub ask about why /r/raisedbynarcississts cant be accessed. They were getting a message that they couldnt view the community. Now I get one of our subscribers saying they are getting a message that says ""'You cannot view the community at this time. Please contact the moderators for further information'."" when they try to get to our community. Anyone know why this is happening?EDIT: The subscriber that submitted it to me just sent back this ""It only seems to happen when I use mobile, and it's when I try to access the sub from my favorite subs list. Not sure what version of Reddit I'm using. I'm assuming the new one?"". And my sub is /r/NarcissisticAbuse."
none,"We inherited an automod set up to post a automatic comment on each post and sticky it to the top with the basic rules and links to resources for each post. I would like to personalize it by grabbing the username and say, ""Hi [USERNAME], welcome to [SUBNAME]"". How do I add that to the existing script?"
none,"There is a new show coming in the future to TNT/TBS called Chasing the Cure Live. I happened to catch the commercial for it. They are looking for submissions on undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, or uncured medical mysteries. I didnt know if anyone wanted to submit their CFS/ME or other conditions to the site for consideration. [HERE](https://www.chasingthecurelive.com/) is the link if you want to check it out."
none,"My NexHusband was my second husband, and was clinically diagnosed in my presence with NPD. He wasnt the father to my sons. The tl;dr is that I left him in 2014, divorce was final in 2015, and he died of a heroin overdose in 2018. So its been over a year since he died. My first husband, my sons Dad, is bipolar. Something neither of us knew until about 15 years after our divorce. I have worked really hard to maintain a relationship with him for the kids and he has been a good father. So last night I was invited by my first husband for a BBQ at his house. I get to see the boys Sister who is almost 15 (how dare these kids grow up so fast! But at least I get to buy girl stuff!) and my exes wife and her family (who are a lot of fun and I really like, and is the only family my Ex has left alive anymore). We had a good time. But later in the evening my Ex took me aside and told me he felt he should tell me about a dream he had because it really upset him. He told me that my Nex came to him in a dream the other night. In the dream, he was beating on their front door screaming for me. That he wanted me and nothing was going to stop him from getting me. That I belonged to him. He told me it shook him up. So it didnt bother me at the time. I really dont have much left over issues with the Nex. Those that I do tend to get better when I write it out. It kinda takes any power out of the words when I do that. It makes things easier for me. I felt intense relief when he died. I felt safe. I felt my kids were safe. I have not grieved and still have no issues feeling badly or sad about his death. I really dont feel much more then that about it at all. But hearing about this dream kinda shook me up a bit. And its been rolling around in my mind. Im not sure what to make of it. Im having a hard time processing it, tbh. Anyone else have a problem like that? I dont suffer from disturbing dreams or anything, I never remember my dreams. But this is really bothering me and I cant shake it or put my finger on it exactly to really, I dunno, digest it and process it."
none,We created this sub as a sister sub to /r/NarcissisticAbuse. We found that there were a large portion of posts there dealing with divorcing an abuser and custody issues with an abuser. Having a sub to focus just on these heart wrenching life events for support specifically from other folks that have gone through this or are also going through it will hopefully help! We welcome you to this new community! Let the healing begin!
none,"If we remove a post for cause you will receive a message from the moderators explaining what rule was broken at that time. We do have some filters in place to protect the sub from certain things, and that means you may get these messages from the automoderator telling you that it was removed. At that time, all that means is that we need to manually review the post. It does not mean you are a rule breaker. Many of the auto posts removed are pushed out live back to the community, often before even notice they had been removed. If not, and there is a rule broken, you will get the communication from us explaining why it was removed then. Messaging the moderators does not move this process along faster, and in fact will slow it down. We generally review the filters first and often to keep the posts moving. So if you have a post removed like this, dont worry. We will get to it as soon as one of us is available, which we try to be available as often as we can. We value your posts and want the community to be able to help with insight, support, and just to be there when you need it. This is a wonderful community and we thank each and every one of you for your contribution."
none,"We enrolled the sub some time ago, and now I cant see any actions in modmail. It flashes when I click there, I see glimpses of the messages, then they blink out. I can see ""New"" mail, ""In progress"" as having a message with a count. The shield is highlighted, but I cant seem to get the messages. I have full permissions in the sub, so I dont know why this is happening or how to correct it. I did try going through the mod support center and the other messages and cant seem to find any with this issue. Any ideas?"
none,"Please help the community by providing the resources including links to prominent blogs/vlogs, books, and other helpful resources (not self promotion or small without a large following from over time) that have been helpful to you in your path to healing from Narcissistic Abuse. Tell us a bit about why you recommend it and how it helped you. **NOTE: Please label any Sam Vankin and HG Tudor with them having diagnosed NPD and ASPD as a warning.** "
none,"Just got diagnosed today with my first really new diagnosis since 2013. It turns out that I have Long Nerve Neuropathy. I saw a neurologist today about odd pain that started in my feet about a year ago. With CFS/ME, Fibro, Psoriatic Arthritis, Hashimotos, Complex Sleep Apnea, Vitamin D and B deficiency (not from malabsorbtion), RLS, and I know I am forgeting a few here, I went throug the regular doctors in the past year to see what was causing it cause it was weird. Everyone ruled the basics out as a specific point of causation. So off to the Neurologist I went. New to this area about 4 years ago, havent seen one since my move. And I have to tell you, she was amazing. Nice, was interested in a number of things about my CFS like not being able to see when I woke up, to the new study about the heat in the brains (she actually has read and kept up on the lastest stuff, I was shocked), and the fact that when I am tired, I watch dubbed documentaries and shows because I cant process what I hear well. But when I described the pain I was having in my feet which started about a year ago, has gotten worse and is moving up my legs now, she had an immediate answer. And damn. It fits all the weird things that I thought were CFS. Like the odd crashing blood sugar out of no where (not diabetic), the POTS while Im just sitting down like normal, etc. Its Long Nerve Neuropathy, under the umbrella of the Peripheral Neurpathy ([NIH Stuff](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-neuropathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352061) and Im affected in all three main areas (Sensory, Motor, Autonomic nerves) which blows. Its like CFS/Fibro/Arthritis and all the other autoimmune crap is often there when you develop this neurpathy. So thats a bit of a bummer. It doesnt get better and there is no real good treatment (Im already doing Gabapentin for Fibro) or repair. I did get referred for Med Marijuana for my Fibro and Psoriatic Arthritis just yesterday. Guess we can figure Im a shoo in with this nasty like hitchhiker. I really did like this Neurologist. She was thoughtful, she listened, and she knows the new stuff!! She keeps up on the studies! She knows its real. So thats really good. Getting a diagnosis doesnt mean I just now have it, its probably been working for some time on me. So I really appreciated her time and talking to me like a normal person and explaining it all to me. Even why I can get a needle and not even feel or register any sensation or pressure, or it can feel like someone is stabbing me in my eyes. This stuff does that with hypersensitivity like Fibro and CFS does too. So I just thought I would share. Ive had this stuff since 2008's diagnosis. Just thought it may help to know something else that folks need to look out for. Happy Thursday I guess."
none,"So, I have CFS/ME, Fibro and Psoriatic Arthritis (among many other conditions) but have refused to take RX pain meds. One parent is a oxy popping addict that doctor surfs, their parent is an life long alcoholic, and since there is no cure or other means of pain relief on the horizon, my doctor wants me to get on the wacky tobacy, cheeba cheeba, to ride the 420 express. I dont want to feel high, I just want the pain to be lessened without getting more exhausted then I already am and have been for over a decade now. My question is, has anyone been using it for that purpose here, and how well does it work for you? I have a spot in my back shoulder near my spine that has been a massive lump that is excruciatingly painful for over 20 years now. Sometimes its better, others worse. Im hoping that spot, which is at a normal fibro location, will get better as will some of the every day draining pain as well as help the insomnia and sleeping issues I have. I have not partaken before (I know, I know, Im 46) and am not sure what to expect. Any suggestions?"
none,"Right now, Reddit has a very high filter going through things and it grabs posts which then have to be manually reviewed by us moderators and pushed live to the community. As you may know, moderators do not work for Reddit, we volunteer our time and energy and we may not have one of us available at all times. We do check our filters very regularly once we are available and will push it out as soon as we can. If a post was removed for a cause by us, you will receive a message specifically telling you why it was removed when we actually remove it. So if you encounter this problem with messages of [removed] or [removed automoderator], its just the system filtering. Please be patient with the system and dont message the moderators or submit duplicates of your post thinking it just didnt show up. We most commonly do the filters first before dealing with mod mail. We dont know the process that the site uses for filtering out spam, and it changes regularly. Long time users are getting filtered, as well as new users, or low volume users, we dont know the rhyme or reason at play. So please be patient. We promise we will address the filtered posts as soon as possible. We are sorry for any delay you have. We value your posts and activity here on our sub, and just how wonderful this community really is. "
none,"I am so thankful to have found this sub. It's been one year and although I'm not where I want to be, I am so close. Thank you to everyone for your posts, comments and advice. I don't know where I'd be now if I hadn't of researched his behaviour on the internet. (If you have to google your partners behaviour btw, it's probably toxic) During this time I've managed to move out of my narcs flat and into a different place. Although I did actually break up with him, I did let the no contact fall. 4 months since the move and I'm still seeing him and talking everyday. For him it's like everything is fine. What am I doing! And that was the worst decision - I should've have been stronger and listened to all of you. Now I'm in the midst of a hoover and the pull is extremely powerful. Being a covert, he is so smart with what he is doing and it makes me genuinely quite foggy. I have tried to remind myself of all the damage he has done. But for some reason I am clinging to him. I don't even know what for, and what I really love about him at this point. I just wanted to say thank you. I owe so much to this forum and the team behind it. I know I will keep fighting."
none,"I cannot escape him. He has quite literally ruined my life. I think I might even move cities. But then I guess he really won, I guess I really am crazy. Why did I have to chose him. Someone I work with. Feeling super hopeless right now."
none,I'm really at a point where I don't even know what the heck I'm doing anymore. What is this serving me? What am I holding on to? All I have are really traumatic times and rarely any good memories. The gaslighting was enough. I ended up being boundaryless and sticking around is basically saying I'm fine with that? Help me out. I'm at a loose end. I've tried everything. Even re programming my subconscious and hypnosis.
none,"I recommend making two lists. One side of all the things you wanted in a relationship when you were younger / now. The other side all the things they have done to hurt you or prove that he (or she) cannot provide you that.Slowly, this will help you see it for what it really is. We will get there. We can break it. I'm so glad to be part of this support system because this is also a vital step."
none,"I've been trying to leave my narc partner - but we work together and my colleague phones him right in front of me with flirty comments and remarks each day. I'm struggling because I love my job so much, I just wish I hadn't have found (what I thought was love) in the workplace!!!! I didn't know he was a narcissist when I met him in all honesty but the past year and a half has shown me a lot and dealt me with some absolute crap from him. I haven't fully cut off yet but this is making it a whole lot harder. My colleagues in general think he's the absolute gods gift and so handsome, nice and charming. There's not much I can do because they absolutely have to communicate as well... sorry for the rant."
none,"I can't help but think and wonder whether it's worth a try again. This phase” he's been nice to me and it's so warming knowing that he wants me always so he says. I have amnesia from all the abuse he's put me through. All I want to do is go back to him.  I'm questioning so hard on whether he even is a narcissist. Here I am again, coming to this sub to lean on strangers."
none,"Still been trying to get away, but the guilt just takes over. I feel so guilty that he is fighting for this relationship, I feel so awful knowing that he will question himself and his worth once I tell him I'm not coming back. I feel like I've put him through torture making him wait for an answer. He wants that bit of hope from me, the reassurance. Hopefully we can sort it out though, babe?” I get this message too often. How is it I forget about all the shitty things he's done to me? And I see the most beautiful person in front of me? I need to remember this is just a lie. Ugh."
none,"In the midst of a break up with my narc boyfriend. I left, moved out but I'm still seeing and talking all day and meeting most days. I feel like I don't know how to cope without him. What makes this trauma bond worse is that we work together. I'm stuck on trying to break off from him. I'm reliant on him. I feel so unhealthy myself. I struggle to know what to do if I can't speak with him. The comfort with him is like no other even if it is unsafe. I guess all I've known is unsafe. The childhood wounds must be healed, too."
none,"Don't do what I've done. I escaped, left, packed all my things and moved. But I kept in contact with him. Now I've been spending so much time and messaging him it's like we are almost back together. How the hell did I let this happen. I don't know how to even break it off again because now I'm a real bitch for leading him on! The trauma bond is so intense and I wished with everything I have I didn't respond or see him at all. Run, block, delete, and run again!!!! Helpppp!!!"
none,I actually feel like I might need professional help. I've been in limbo with my narc ex for about a month. I did actually break up with him but somehow he has managed to invalidate this break up and manipulate me into trying” when in fact I KNOW I have to cut all ties as soon as possible. What am I holding on for? I've never felt so depressed in my life. I'm left with so many mental scars. I'm even thinking it could be ptsd? He has no idea the damage he has done. Do they even know what they are doing? Guys I'm really struggling and I don't know what to do or where to go from here. Fighting off these horrible thoughts.
none,"Has anyone else experienced negging from their narcissist? I get called so many strange names all day long and laughed at. For example weird names about my head or unpleasant weird (not funny) characters names? But if I am dressed nice it go out I can see the pain in their eyes to see me like that - as if they hate me? And I can barely get a looking nice” comment out of him. Negging: (derived from the verb neg, meaning ""negative feedback"") is an act of emotional manipulation whereby a person makes a deliberate backhanded compliment or otherwise flirtatious remark to another person to undermine their confidence and increase their need of the manipulator's approval."
none,"I'm so sick of these push and pull feelings of I love him, no I can't love him. I hate that addiction I have to him. A text comes through and I'm excited. I get to see him I'm excited. I don't know how I can pull myself out and away. I wanna cry. I want him. But I shouldn't want him. He just tries to destroy me. I can't stop crying and I wish that this would just stop. What the hell do I do."
none,"Hi everyone. It's been 4 weeks since I left my narcs apartment with the majority of my things and broke up”. Since then I have not kept the no contact rule and have ended up speaking every day, hour, and seeing each other a few times a week. Somehow I have managed to get myself in this mess. He has twisted the situation and I have not been strong enough to say simply, no. He thinks we are heading in the right direction and that we are still together in a relationship. I absolutely feel so devastated because I'm in and out of these emotions and it's absolutely so incredibly painful. I want to love him, I want him to love me. I'm questioning absolutely everything at the moment. I don't know what the is right, what is reality!!!! Now I've essentially led him on into a false sense because I know deep down I can't be with him. It's like I'm going to have to break off all over. He's tried to win me over. Tell me he can change and that we can work through it. Im so sorry to come here but I do just need some support and guidance. Thank you. Stay safe. (I haven't gone back to his apartment during these times, had any physical touch etc. Just a kiss and hug.)"
none,I need to close the door. Close the book. Slam it and run!!!! How can I just let go for good? Felt impossible to leave but i did it. The hardest parts done 😣 I'm addicted to this asshole!?!
none,"I broke up with my narc boyfriend around 2 weeks ago. Unfortunately I haven't been no contact. I have been speaking to him everyday and seeing him a few times a week to be honest. I know I can't see the future with him. But I almost feel like I'm the one leading him on here? I've already done the hard parts of leaving, moving out - but when I broke up with him I told him it was it. He has somehow manipulated the situation into telling me it isn't over, and that he's not asking for a second chance because these issues are about us BOTH? Well I can tell you now they aren't. This is so weird. I'm literally addicted but I know how unhealthy and abusive he is and has been to me! I want to cut him off for good!"
none,"Has anyone else felt this worry? When I tell him that it's for real over I know he's going to be so broken and I'm actually really worried about what he might do. Even to himself. Like go off the rails, drugs? Even hurt himself? It holds me back because I want to be here for him. But I have to save myself and listen to my gut."
none,"Hey guys I left my (suspected narc bf) on Friday last week. Since then I have seen him once and have been in contact with him a lot this week. He is talking to me as if we aren't broke up but I had definitely told him on Friday I'm out. When I saw him on Monday this week as I left he said I don't see this as a break up” I told him I'm unhappy and I don't trust him as I was leaving and he was in absolute bits. He has told me I can look at his phone whenever I want or have his passwords and he wants to try everything possible to try make this relationship work. He also gets involved with drugs when with friends and I just don't think it's sensible (in my personal opinion) and he also states he will stop doing all of that.Now I'm thinking: CAN THEY ACTUALLY CHANGE? Is he ACTUALLY a narcissist? He basically said to me the reason he has been acting different and out of line is due to work, stress and lockdown. He said that because I haven't posted him on social media that's why he can be a dick and accuse me of weird things. He thinks I'm hiding him, on my phone a lot, posting selfie's or pictures for attention and asking for attention. So did he just blame me for the reason I'm unhappy??? Baring in mind he does not post me on his social media at all."
none,"I left him on Friday. By Monday I've already met up with him! What am I doing? He's given me gifts, tears, the words I long to hear and more. Because this is the first time we have had a proper fall out / break up he just wants us to give it a go. Communicate more and try. I'm honestly wondering if he's even a narcissist at this point? Help help help"
none,Hey everyone - it's been 3 days since I left my narc bf and moved pretty much everything possible out. I'm having the worst time thinking that I was too harsh to just call it quits after my lack of communication”. I just want to go back and take that pain away for me and him. He wants me to come back and believes it is worth a try. He even suggested couples counselling. I'm just asking for any advice or support you may have? I don't know how to not love him anymore...
none,"I left my partner yesterday who I believed was toxic and a narc but I can't help think what have I done!? Im questioning whether he is abusive at all, I'm missing him already. It hurts so much."
none,I have just moved pretty much all my things out and broke up with him. This feel like the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. I've spent hours on this sub and posted several times and so grateful for your comments and support. How can I go no contact? I'm struggling already and he is convinced we will get back together. I absolutely love this man with all my heart despite the pain he's put me through.
none,"I have never felt so emotionally unstable in my life. This is like nothing I've ever experienced before. I can't even recognise myself in the mirror at this point. I really do not feel like me anymore. I'm so sorry to whoever has had to feel like this too. So many lows, confusing states! I have 0 happy memories with this person. What the hell am I doing here?"
none,"I struggle with this the most because I feel the pain of the others more than me. Regardless of if they have treated me bad and how toxic it may have been, which is what I'm going through now. Let me know how you have coped with this before!"
none," by text, followed by a conversation in person?  in person, out of the blue?  a we need to talk moment? I've been gearing things up and getting my things into place ready for the big day. He's decided to put his house up for sale and wants to upgrade (with in mind that I am coming too - just not joining on a mortgage etc. I've said NO!) I feel awful in a way because he sees” this future with me and getting a bigger house. Thing is... I'm not falling for it really. I'm done with being a maid around here as it is. I'm done with being bullied the second I'm awake. Any advice, welcome! Thank you as always. (I have been moving things out very slowly, and sneakily! And I'm all set up to go somewhere safe and happy)"
none,So after my realisation that the person I am with I cannot trust and have been through a lot of emotional abuse with. I'm currently in a weird stage right now? It's one where he's being nicer than usual. And he wants to re locate and buy a new / bigger place. He keeps pestering me to be in it with him. I don't feel confident at all about this nor do I want to go through with it!!!! Is this my lucky escape? How can I just tell him I don't want to do this? I'm afraid I've been quiet for so so long now and he will be so pissed at how long I've kept quiet for.
none,"HiI have been trying to really get in touch with spirituality. I am becoming very In tune with my intuition. But I'm having a really difficult time in my life and I'm wondering if anyone can offer me some guidance, or advise? Sorry if this is not allowed. Sending you all whatever you need. X"
none,Seriously it's been about 8 months since I realised quite how toxic my relationship is. I'm really struggling on how I can leave this. I know I HAVE to!!! Especially during Covid I have found this almost impossible. I don't seem to have any strength. I think he is aware that somethings up with me so has been playing extra nice recently. It's making me guilty despite everything he's done. I'm forever asking for help and advice and I just feel at breaking point. I wish someone could do this for me. I'm not strong enough.
none,"I'm curious to see whether there are any couples or what your relationships / friendships etc are like in these two types of personalities? I've just found that I am a ENJF, hi!"
none,"This is something I need to stop saying. Does anyone else feel this?I am constantly in a state of confusion about everything. I'll wake up, and think it's ok, today he is fine...” then each day goes by. I've become numb and tolerant of the disrespect and abuse at this point.I want to just leave but I stop everyday."
none,You keep pushing my boundaries. You keep testing my faith. You keep me being a shell of myself. You put me down every day. You tell me you're joking. You tell me you care. But all you do is hurt me. I need to get out of here.
none,"Hi everyone.My narc bf keeps screaming, singing or directly speaking right into my ear canal really loudly. I've told him many times he is hurting me. It gives me such an ear ache and can even cause me hearing problems in the future potentially? I've just directly told him to stop doing it because I was on the verge of tears with how much it just hurt me. All he would say is yeah stop going on I've said sorry” 😢"
none,I want my life back. I want my friends back. I want my sanity back. I want me back. I don't want this life. Why am I hanging around? It's not serving a purpose for me. None of even my basic needs are being met. I'm hurt emotionally or physically (...it was a joke / it was an accident) every single day. I see the happiness it brings him to hurt me. He is so evil. He's got me stuck.
none,"Sometimes it's sweet, sometimes it's sour"
none,Any words. Any advice. I can't do it anymore. This is not the life for me.
none,Well here we go again... my heart fell in my mouth and the gut wrench came after. There's a bigger story to this but she was the one he supposedly left for me over a year ago. Today's the day I tell him quite how disrespectful he is to me. Today's the day I say how I really feel. And if I am called crazy again I am out. Asking for any strength and courage to get me through this!  So scared to even bring it up
none,"Well this has got to be one of the worst ones yet. I ask him to go for a walk with me in the day all the time and he doesn't.  He will only walk with me at night, whilst no ones around.  I ask him to come food shopping with me and he will take a step back so that it looks like we aren't together? The only reason I am think this is - because he is talking or getting supply from somewhere else!!! I haven't felt shit about myself like this before but I really do now"
none,"By acting not phased or unbothered about doing things for him, like a don't care / don't want to attitude I am noticing a huuuuuge shift. He wants everything from me - blood sweat and tears! It's a constant need for attention, affection and acts of service - isn't it? I went out today for a walk with a girl friend and it was as if I had done something seriously wrong. I was such a bad person to leave him for an hour. I came back and he was telling how he was stressed and thinking of not being here” or ending it” because of work and life - which is something I'm hearing more often. I try to be as supportive as possible but can only do and say so much for him. I'm becoming a shell."
none,I am too. I send you real love. The love you deserve. I get it now. This isn't love. I received a teddy with his face printed on it... Better than flowers though isn't it” it's always going to be about him. He doesn't see anyone but him. This might be a positive right here because I woke up thinking I don't love him. Almost there 🤞🏼 Give yourself the love you try to give others. Do something for yourself today.
none,"So every time I think about breaking free from my narc I just feel like I physically can't. Did anyone else feel or feels like this too? I feel like I'm going slightly insane now - living in two minds and two lives. I don't feel like my own feelings are enough to break up despite everything he has mentally abused me about (gaslighting, lying) I feel like I have to find something else in order for me to free myself. How can I love someone but hate them too?"
none,Hi At the beginning of our relationship we would have good intimacy often. Now I'm finding that he will say something like let's have sex tonight” as if I am holding back. But then when it comes to it he will fall asleep or pretend like he forgot. It's quite hurtful and I'm wondering if anyone else has encountered this kind of thing?Thanks
none,After having suspicions before there was shady stuff and conversations / Snapchat's going on. I didn't leave then and for what reason? I will never know. They are never going to not seek other attention. But that's nothing to do with you. You are always more than enough. I keep feeling like I need to check his phone to find a reason to leave because I know it'll be there. But I know it'll only hurt more. And then what I'll be stuck in another cycle.
none,"For a second before he wakes up I think about how much I love him and I convince myself that this is a good relationship. Then he wakes up and it begins. The bullying, the devaluing and the disrespecting of my boundaries no matter how small. I'm starting to wonder how I'm ever going to leave because I've been saying it for over 6 months now."
none,Why don't you just leave”You'll be so much happier without him”He doesn't even do the bare minimum”And I know he's hurt me. I know he's lied. But I'm trying to understand why. I won't ever be enough for him because that's how he makes me feel. I just need to find the strength.
none,Does anyone else notice their partners follow back girls/guys they obviously don't know on socials? I find it insulting personally. But maybe I'm too sensitive! I'm about to approach it but can't wait for the comments to come out about how I'm crazy or too sensitive.
none,So it's his birthday. What better way to wind me up so much that I then apparently ruin his day. Nothing you ever do is good enough. I have nothing left!!!!
none,Potential Trigger Warning ⚠️Hi guys - I wanted to put trigger warning just incase because I'd like to share what has happened today in hope of some advice...This morning my partner woke up and he wasn't feeling very well (I believe he has been on a come down as he may have drugs two days ago) and he was complaining about feeling poorly. He grabbed me by the neck with not a lot of force but there was force and shook me saying how unwell he is and his throat/nose is hurting. I felt so small and I really genuinely felt scared. It made me think and vision what else he would and could do to me. Is this abusive behaviour? Or am I being sensitive? I wouldn't do this to my partner or friends even as a joke.

none,"...no I've just been telling you no when I don't want to run around after you all day, or listen to you bullying me and putting me down. You really don't like me do you” ...no again, I've been trying to communicate to you when I don't like something and I am no longer sacrificing my happiness over yours. I hope this is moving me forward to the finish line."
none,Everyday I am in two minds and for the majority of the day now he just pisses me off and I hate to say that but it's true. I can see so so clearly how he tries to control me for the benefit of him and how he puts me down. Then I just feel sad for him and feel love for him when he plays the victim after I've not responded to his condescending comments towards me. He wants so much out of me all of the time and I'm exhausted. To the point where I think my mental health is about to decline. And when I say I don't want to do one of those 100 tasks for him a day he proceeds to say how much he does for me... I took the bins out” or I drove us to the shop and back”  I'm tiredI'm almost done (so I keep telling myself...)
none,Probably for 2-3 months. I am already drained of everything I have. Now it feels impossible to get out. Live together AND work at home together. The more I realise and understand about my narc the harder it is to feel love towards them.
none,"I feel so sad. A little story time. Prior to the relationship I'm in now (with a narc) I was in a relationship with someone whom I had a house, dog and life with. There were issues in this relationship and in hindsight I feel so sad because we could've probably fixed them. And I believe after me leaving he would've. Instead I walked away from it all. I was blinded by a colleague in work, who I confided in and got close to. He gave me the attention I fell for it. (Definitely a love bomb moment) A year later I am in this relationship with someone who holds narcissist behaviours and I'm realising that I am in a MUCH worse situation. We still work together. How could I have been so stupid to have fallen for this. I feel weak. I hate to compare to a previous relationship but I really am feeling so sad about it. I am treated so bad in comparison. I do not live in regret because I am a believer that life is teaching me these lessons. I just wish I wasn't so naive and stupid. X"
none,"Does or did your narc partner require attention all the time? I am constantly hounded for it. Even to the smallest of things. I'll be on my phone replying to emails and he will insist I scratch him his back for him or something along the lines. He always wants me to sit with him and watch films, tv. He hates me tidying around the apartment because I'm not spending time with him (even though he never does anything around the place like cleaning or cooking etc - it's exhausting). He always asks me what am I up to when on my phone as if he suspects I'm doing something I shouldn't be which I'm not. Every day it's dragging me down more and more. He wants me to give him a head rub, a back massage, and just generally like pamper him constantly... he says it like give me the attention I deserve” If I don't give him the attention. I will get shouted at and made to feel like the worst person in the world. He will pinch me or play fight” me and think it's funny. Right now he is literally insulting me about the size of my head” or something immature and mean in a form of a song because I'm not giving him my full attention. I'm starting to believe it's a control thing and not a needy thing. I'm sorry to go on, to moan again and again but I'm truly drained. This place helps me express myself."
none,"Hi everyone, hope you have been having a restful period. I have been locked down due to Covid with my narc bf after moving in (far too quickly) since about March. It's been a rollercoaster. But even with all the bad that's been happening... currently we seem to be getting on ok. Despite the fact he's been happily lying to me about all sorts the past year. He seems to be being less of a jerk. He spent so much on me for Xmas I wasn't expecting it. I got a nice card that said thanks for putting up with me this year” and we spent Xmas at his parents. Where actually... he was a jerk to them. I just wanna know if others go through a relatively nice period? Does it hang around long?"
none,"My bf (27m) acts really weird around his phone. He turns off his notifications so they don't pop up on his screen. We've been together about a year. I'm pretty much non existent on any of his social media too, just a side note I guess. I've asked him before because I've seen him Snapchat multiple (+6 other girls) and he just said that they are friends. I feel so stupid to have believed that months ago. How could they be friends if I've never heard of them? I believe I have some trust issues with him but he does not reassure me in anyway or make me feel comfortable in this relationship. There's been so many lies about things like drug use, steroid use, etc. I just don't know what to do. I think I'm trauma bonded. Help!"
none,I wish that you didn't lie to me. I wish that you were as lovely as everyone thinks. I wish you didn't put me down at every opportunity. I wish you would support me like I do you. I wish this wasn't toxic. I wish I wasn't happy being this uncomfortable. I wish I could trust you.
none,"Hi everyone, I'm struggling as I am in a toxic relationship. And maybe I hold some toxic tendencies too (being codependent. I'm not sure that's toxic or not too be honest) I'm asking for help and advice on how I can break through this? I don't think this relationship is sustainable for my mental health or happiness. The issue is that the person I am with has many narcissistic tendencies. This almost feels like an addiction - like I can't get away no matter how bad it gets. Thank you"
none,I feel so confused and up and down in this relationship with my narc. I am understanding now that this is totally a trauma bond too. I'm terrified. One part of me feels so content to just stay and settle in this sadness and another part of screaming at me to leave. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what the right thing is. I'm afraid if I leave I'll do the wrong thing and feel worse.
none,Meant to feel excited and happy for Christmas coming up. But I'm just dreading how he will ruin it. He always brings up how last year I spent it somewhere else and how it ruined his day. Sending you all the best wishes. Stay strong!
none,"I'm curious to see and hear your experiences with  narcissists attitudes. For example: my narc partner is extremely obsessed with expensive things, expects £1000s spent on him over bdays/xmasses, acts entitled and better than me or others, is generally super negative, insults all of my friends and family, insults me in a roundabout way, expects special treatment etc... the list really goes on. I also read that a narcissists blaming you of something is the closest thing to a confession” meaning they are confessing to whatever they are blaming you for. I always get blamed for things like sending naked pics” and it honestly baffles me. I have no idea why he would believe that. Now I'm starting to believe it's his confessions. Anyway, let me know your thoughts if you want...Always grateful to share and talk with you all. X"
none,He just lies to me about everything. I always feel like I need evidence. I'm so near done. Sorry for the rant.
none,"Hi everyone, I've began to say things like, you are always insulting me these aren't jokes”, NO and stop talking to me like that”. He isn't happy that I am seeing myself in a better light than him. He isn't happy that I have some self love and respect. Thinking about how I can escape. I understand it is never good timing. Now being Xmas too isn't great. I'm always trying to find more things that add to my list for validation. I'm thinking a new year, and a fresh start could be a great opportunity to leave. I hate that I have to work with him - it makes it so difficult and I'm so so scared of how he will paint me out to be to the office. Worst thing is, I believe he's lying and taking class a drugs behind my back. I confronted him again and he just went mad at me telling me how it's the most disrespectful thing anyone has ever said and that I am gone” in the head. I ended up fucking apologising. I didn't stand my ground. I've let it go. ANOTHER THING GO!!!! Either way if I'm right or wrong. I feel like I'm going crazy :( Appreciate everyone's comments. Sorry to moan. But thank you for allowing me to space. It feels lonely."
none,"Hey guys, I'm slowly but surely getting closer to leaving. I keep telling myself that. My mind is made up. I can NOT change them. It will only get worse. All my boundaries have been foreseen. All my fears have probably happened. I'm basically super paranoid waiting and preparing myself for the next thing that's going to upset me. Recently I've been thinking what if he's on dating apps? Like desperately trying to find a reason to leave. I've even thought about downloading apps like tinder(dunno how to use it) to check if he is active on there. I just sound so insane. This isn't right for me to be thinking these things! I've started to note all the nasty little comments. I get name called all sorts from childish immature comments like fat head” or he will make songs up about me that go like everyone thinks you stink like shit, but I don't” like what is that? Hope ur all good. X"
none,"Does anyone else keep having moments of being gaslighted and lied to (and you are pretty sure about it too, like you know in your gut) by your partner but you just can't find the strength to leave and they really convince you it's you not them. I just can't seem to say no, I don't believe you or trust you so I'm off. How can I go from here? If I bring it all up I'll be called all sorts. I just want to say I don't trust you and I can't be with you but I'm just suffering and settling!!!"
none,Hi everyone I am trying to come up with the courage to leave my narc bf. The issue is that we also work together in the same department. I feel like this is going to be harder than anything. They all see him so charming and wonderful in the office and as if I am the lucky one to have him. No one will ever understand the abuse and hurt he has caused me. Any advice on how I can make this easier? Sending you all love x
none,"I was going about my morning at the gym and I posted  a progress picture of myself in the mirror today on insta. I got picked up from the gym my narc bf and I told him just to let you know I've put a picture on my story” sort of a pre warning before he sees it and says something rude to me, and his response was... WHY are you doing that! Why are you trying to get boys attention!!?” And I was like well obviously that's not the case I'm just happy with my progress and wanted to share with my friends. He is the type to follow lots of girls back that are younger and post much more explicit content. When I saw him view my story I could see the look of disgust on his face. It totally broke me.  What even? He never compliments me or says anything nice."
none,"So my boyfriend has said repeatedly now that he no longer has a personality because of me. He says that I don't allow him to have a personality or laugh” when he is openly just insulting me or putting me down. When I call him out on what I would call dysfunctional behaviour (doing drugs, lying, putting others down or disrespecting) he always pulls this card. It really upsets me and I don't want to change anyone. That's not my purpose."
none,Yeah... sure she was. I was so oblivious to it. How could I have been so naive. I am living and in a relationship with someone who holds intense narcissistic behaviours. I've been lied to and gaslit on many occasion. But why have I just swept it under the rug each time? I hate the way I'm called crazy or get those listen to yourself!!!!” comments. Why is it always turned around on me? Like I'm the bad guy!?! I would hate to know what else I don't know about. How can I break away from this? I'm living a total lie and it's so hard.
none,"So this is my first post. Hi. I've been with a guy for about a year now. In this time I've realised that I am most definitely dealing with what seems to be a narcissist. The beginning was all lovely, so intense and connected on another level” so it seemed.As time has gone on I've realised that ALL of my boundaries have been overstepped and I am constantly being lied to. I barely know his friends. I feel like a joke. I'm non existent on his social media and he turns off his notifications on his phone so I can't see them pop up by chance. He claims that he does a lot for me when in fact I really don't feel the same. The bare basics are being met. Recently I've had a gut feeling that he has been taking drugs behind my back. I am not stupid... When you know you know. I confronted him about this and he went CRAZY at me. He has a history of using drugs and we've had those conversations before. We actually work in the same place so he may be worried about if I share this (which i wouldn't obvs) also not ideal. I don't really know where I'm going with this I'm always acting like everything's fine towards him but in my head I'm like ahhhh gooooo but I know it's gonna kill me. I'm worried he's using drugs and is in denial and if I leave then it could get worse? Any guidance, advice and help is welcome. I just need some courage. Codependent problems too you could say. Toxic enough? 🙄[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/k44fc2)"

none,"I have a party of 6, and they've just been invited to a Human Sorcerer King's banquet in honour of Oberon the ArchFey. Stylistically, we're set in fairly typical late middle-age-Europe. This dinner is almost like a peace treaty between the Elves and the Humans, tensions are high, and there's a lot of racial discrimination on both sides. Half-elves have typically been looked down on in both societies, and views are only now slowly beginning to change as peace and mutually beneficial trade are looking more likely. The party have been asked to find more appropriate attire” for the event, and we spent nearly an hour in-session at a tailor & dressmakers detailing exactly how they wanted their clothes to look. Each of them had hugely specific requests, trying to reflect their character's feelings towards the aristocracy and the Kings they'll be surrounded by at an event they don't really want to attend, but are required to as grudging emissaries (of sorts) between the two Kingdoms. Brandon, the Half-Elf Warlock. Male, 21. Blue eyes, medium length dirty blonde hair, Elven ears but generally takes after his human mother. His familiar is an Imp who is usually invisible. He has a very distinctive Chrystal shard necklace. Oberon doesn't know he's Brandon's father, or that after he spurned her, Brandon's mother died impoverished leaving Brandon to fend for himself. Brandon grew up around racist humans, but *hates* Oberon more than the humans that mistreated him over the years. The tailor is Brandon's long lost grandfather, who also doesn't know his identity, but believes Brandon is looking into the disappearance of his daughter, so feels indebted to him. The tailor would go to extra effort to make his suit something spectacular. He requested something very clearly predominantly human styled, as a bit of a middle finger to Oberon. But a few extremely high-end Elven flourishes, and with extremely high quality fabrics”. Tarquin, the Half-Elf Rogue. He's attending this event in disguise, posing as a military man. Oberon wrongly banished Tarquin's whole family from the FeyWild when he was only a boy, putting his father out of business and driving him to suicide. Tarquin also absolutely hates Oberon. He's Male, 22, with short-medium wavy strawberry blonde hair and hazel/green eyes. He's the charismatic, flirtatious one of the group. He has an tawny owl familiar, and the owl is abnormally small. He will be trying to smuggle a poisoned dagger into the event, probably using Mage Hand. He wants his suit to give the appearance of human military stylings, but purposefully lacking any human medals/honours, and in their place - Fey adornments/stylings. He will also be wearing a fitted mask with built in darkvision lenses that covers from mid-forehead to the tip of his nose, in bronze/gold leather. It has peaks that have just the hints of being like devil horns. This is because he's nervous about being recognised, but he's passing it off as being part of his uniform. Vesryn, a high-elf who has eschewed typical vanity and wealth for the life of a Ranger. He's tall, slim, and technically around 150, but looks about 30, with long, straight black/brown hair and blue eyes. He is also technically distantly related to Oberon. He purposefully only wears low-value gemstone jewellery that is exquisitely crafted, (most notably, a Jade ring) and common fashions that are incredibly well made. Oberon runs a slave trade of Goliaths in the gem mines of the FeyWild, and this, amongst many others, is the reason that Vesryn has rejected his roots. He's asked the tailor to point out which design is their most popular, off the peg Elven styled suit, but then asked for it to be tailor made with their finest fabrics, buttons and adornments. He wants to look like he's wearing the exact same suit as at least a few of the other aristocrats there, only better. He'll likely be wearing his boots of elvenkind, and would want the suit to match as much as possible. He has a Flying Sword that he's also going to try and smuggle in, that is a Sword of Dragon Slaying - which will have clear dragon-theming to it. Willow is the only female of the group. She's a human Circle of the Moon Druid who also happens to be a Were-Spider. Willow is the youngest at 19, brunette, green-eyed, and was extremely innocent/naive - having been brought up alone in the woods with her elderly adoptive Druid mother - prior to joining the party. Now she has somewhat of an edge to her, with the bad behaviour of the group rubbing off. She has a very distinctive Unicorn-Pegasus tattoo on her forearm that she will make no efforts to hide. This will be her first foray into anything even remotely aristocratic in terms of an event, and she will likely be nervous and wanting to overcompensate for that in both the formality of her manner and her clothing. She's opted for a flowing formal chiffon gown in a forest green, but with an overlayer of clear net fabric embroidered with coppery coloured vines, foliage and leaves, complemented by beaded flowers and blossoms. She doesn't want it to look overly Elven or Human - but rather something that would be very fashion-forward for the crowd, to reflect that she isn't really of either culture. She wants small, barely noticeable spider motifs incorporated throughout if possible, and the dressmakers have said they will see what they can do. She's also asked if there could be an accompanying cloak that looks to be made of lots and lots of autumnal coloured silk leaves, with a matching bag, it would both complete the look and potentially allow her to smuggle in her component pouch for spellcasting and perhaps even her Grey Bag of Tricks. If not, she will bring along a sentient badger from her Grey Bag of Tricks and pretend it is a familiar. Brint, the Human/WereWolf Fighter. He's early forties, short dark haired, brown eyes, usually with a permanent 5 O'clock shadow. He has a scar on his forehead that just cuts into an eyebrow. He's ex-King's Watch but was fired when his lycanthropy came to light, despite him being one of the purest, kindest men imaginable and having never ever succumbed to violent urges during a full moon. He's wearing a second-hand aristocrats suit that the party stole from a corpse, because he doesn't want the party to have to spend money on him having fine clothes for an event he disdains as much as this one. He doesn't particularly hate either king, but disrespects the aristocracy that forced his unwarranted termination out of fear. It's a fine suit, human styled, but probably won't fit perfectly and might have some well-repaired but evident marks/damage. Lastly, we have Vidar. Vidar is a Goliath Fighter who narrowly escaped a lifetime in Oberon's slave-mines, and spent his time prior to joining the party helping other Goliaths escape that fate. He is surly, antisocial and unsure about the rest of the party, though they are beginning to grow on him. He is enormous, heavily set, muscly, and over 7ft tall, with very closely cropped dark hair and dark, almost black eyes. He has a number of scars running horizontally on either side of his neck, as well as many smaller clearly visible on his skull given how short his hair is. He also has a Pegasus tattoo, and whilst it's largely hidden by clothes, the wing-tip feathers are visible on his neck, as though highlighting the scars there. He's asked for the plainest, most featureless, black suit imaginable. No frills, no adornments, almost invisible hems, all the same fabric, and buttons that blend in as much as possible. Again, it will look nothing like the typical human or Elven suits whatsoever, being so lacking in colour or intricacy, but that's the point. He's different and he wants to look like he's embracing it, rather than trying to fit in. He *despises* Oberon, and Oberon despises him. Any questions, let me know! Would love to see what anyone could come up with. This feels like it's going to be a pretty key scene for the party so I'd love to have a memento of it."

A creature that drinks a dose of this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease – a miniscule slaad egg. A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity,gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process. If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated. This item contains enough poison for 3 doses.87.

Poison Canister: This item resembles an iron cylinder attached to a leathery sack capable of being filled with air. While holding this item, you may spend an action to squeeze the sack to release a 15-foot cone of poisonous gas in front of you. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Once used, this item may not be used again for another 1d8 hours.90. Violet Fungus Stalk: (Ingredient for craftable potion) When you drink this potion, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with the disease gut rot.

Behir Lightning Sack: This large, but surprisingly light leathery sack is located at the back of the behir'scavernous mouth, and is roughly the size of a picnic basket. Inside is a mixture of chemicals, fluids and enzymes that when exposed to the open air, erupts in a destructive crackle of lightning. While extremely dangerous, alchemists and weaponsmiths alike will crawl over themselves to obtain some of this powerful energy. Use: The lightning sack can be thrown by itself up to a range of 20 feet. If thrown, the lightning sack will explode on impact, dealing 4d10 lightning damage to all creatures in a 10 foot radius, or half that on a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.94. Heart of Hruggek - The most fearsome of bugbears carry with them the blessing of their god Hruggekwhich allows them to surge past any danger and debilitations. If you are willing to indulge in your own inner savage, you too can take this blessing by consuming the bugbear's heart, but beware of any side effects. Use: You may spend an action to consume this heart. If you do so, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned, or put to sleep for the next hour. Once this effect wears off, you must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion as the adrenaline filled organ passes through your system.95. Orc Blood (3 vials) :  Drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs. Use: When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of exhaustion.96. Quickling Blood (vial) - Quickling blood remains in motion even after it is drained from its body. Thinnerthan the blood of any other mortal creature, a quickling's blood is loaded with adrenaline and other enzymes that when drunk by a humanoid, slows their perception of time and gives them enhanced reflexes. The crash after the effect has worn off can be rather harsh however. Use: You may spend your action to drink this blood. If you do so, you gain an extra reaction per round on top of your usual amount. This benefit lasts for 1 hour, after which you suffer one level of exhaustion.97. Roc's Feather - The feather of a roc contains magical properties that make it capable of lifting a creature as large as the roc. It is however difficult to find a sample that retains this property after being removed from the roc's body. Use: While holding this item, you may cast the jump spell on yourself at will. This spell ends if you stop holding the feather.98. Sphinx Pelt, cursed: The wearer of any garments crafted using this Sphinx Pelt is cursed, until such time as they have the Remove Curse spell cast upon them. Whilst not an attunement item, the clothing cannot be removed until the curse is liften. The curse swaps a players Charisma and Intelligence stats.99. Opal Ring of Escape. You become ambidextrous. Any checks made to escape bindings are made at advantage. Curse: When the ring is put on, one of the character's limbs no longer has any bones. It flops around uselessly until the bones have successfully regrown in 1d4 days. Players have disadvantage when casting any spell with a somatic component, or on any attack rolls that require both hands. Players cannot dual wield, fire a bow or simultaneously hold a shield and a weapon.100. Belt of Friendship. This belt has a decorative buckle that will alter to reflect something that would appeal to those you come across, seemingly indicating that you have something in common and encouraging them to take an instant liking to you. Your charisma gains +2 whilst you wear this belt. Curse: This curse makes the player compelled to hug all characters they come across, even if it would be inappropriate or awkward. Belt cannot be removed without the use of a Remove Curse spell."

none,"My party are about to hit a dungeon in which I've popped a gate to Hell and a few Cambion. My Warlock PC has just taken Hold Person as a spell. Now, I know that the MM has Cambion as Fiends. But they are *technically* half fiend half human, right? I'm just anticipating the inevitable backlash of my Warlock wasting one of his spell slots on a non-humanoid that looks humanoid and is half human and me having to rule that it did nothing. At the moment I'm tending towards the idea of the slot not being wasted” just to prevent a heated debate, but I'm also curious as to what general consensus is on half-human monsters (eg half Ogre) and humanoid”-ism."
none,"I love my party. If you're a Canoe-loving member of the Famous Five, stop reading. I love my party because they notice everything, and it makes DM'ing for them a whole heap more fun, because no amount of preparation can actually prepare me for their level of engagement. I recently designed a map, showed it to one of my party, and was told ""Topologically, this river confuses me. It has no source. Does this mean that the whole continent tilts westward? Is there lore around the source of that river?""Of course there isn't. But now there is. Thanks for the side quest idea. (Quickly googles, and decides that a series of Geyser Decanters of Endless Water have been mysteriously placed in the source of the river. WHY?!)Another one; I was having some guards accompany my Party from their Inn to a dinner at a local Noble's home. In order to expedite the journey, because they'd taken longer than expected doing something else, I rushed them through the various gates. As I described the gates, I specified that the handles to lift and lower the portcullis were all on the exterior walls. My party questioned this deeply and it still didn't resonate with me, until they reached the innermost compound and said to each other... ""This fortress is a total crapshoot! It's purely visual! It's just to impress the locals, there's no real defence. We can get in and out easily!"". Ah crap. My bad. Hang on... Did any of the players take a good look at the guards? No? Fantastic. Because *retcon* they're all wearing magic armbands that are the only things that actually activate the handles that operate the portcullis. If they try to move the handles themselves, they won't be able to. They're trapped inside the walls until they figure this, or some other solution, out.Any other instances where you've experienced this? It's my favourite and most entertaining aspect of gameplay, bar none. Being a shit-at details-but-acceptable-at-problem-solving DM has definitely been the highlight of my journey thus far."

none,"Hi All! I'm DMing a dungeon dive next weekend, and there's a room in which I'm going to place a Timer Trap. It's something i've seen described in comments for a while and have been looking for an excuse to throw in to an adventure. At the moment, as far as descriptions go, I've got:Stepping into the area where this trap is set will cause all of the entries and exits to the room to become magically barred. Simultaneously, a 1ft tall glowing hourglass will appear in the centre of the room, immediately above a pedestal with a lever on it, as an ethereal voice begins a countdown from 30. 

Nothing will budge the magic bars to exit. Pulling the lever sets the timer back to 30. The only thing that will stop the ‘trap' is for the timer to run down to zero without the lever being pulled, at which point the hourglass will disappear along with the bars and the party can leave with no ill effects.However, I'm curious as to whether I ought to set DCs for the characters to spot it in advance, or ""figure it out"" (i.e. have me give them the answer) - as opposed to letting them rely purely on their own nouse to solve it. Thoughts?"
none,"I've just finished up designing a system of secret tunnels in a sewer that is an offshoot of a dungeon cell. I'm sending my PCs to a dinner where I'd planned to have them captured, put in said cell, and hopefully discover the secret exit into the system of secret tunnels.  It occurred to me that if I ambush them at the dinner, they're potentially going on a heavy duty dungeon dive with less than stellar health/spell slots. I know they're planning to do recon ahead of going to the dinner, so I'm going to massively point out the aboveground entry points to the sewers so they can choose to ""investigate"" them and get themselves into the tunnels that way, and then choose whether to attend the dinner afterwards, or even come out into the Dungeon of the house and sneak in that way.I have a sort-of back-up plan for how to get them into the Dungeon if I have to ambush them, and then they somehow overpower the ambush (tell them there's a captive they'd want to see down there already, then have the captive somehow draw attention to the hidden entrance to the tunnels).What I was wondering was whether there's any strong magic items/effects that a regular noble might be able to use in order to have the ambush almost be guaranteed to succeed without doing them a lot of harm, if it goes that way? Rather than them battling it out against a hoard of guards/baddies and then going into the dungeon with massively reduced HP and spell slots right before they're going on a big dungeon dive. They're going to be super suspicious, so poisons in drinks isn't going to work. It would need to be something really out of the box.Like I said, I have options, I just want to make sure I can get them into these tunnels in as close to perfect condition as possible if they ignore the hooks during recon."
none,"Hi guys! Me and my party are playing over zoom, with me using screen share for showing visuals like magic items, posters, maps etc. When it comes to battles, I've been investigating a few virtual tabletops, but they're just all way too digital and way too complicated for our game. None of my players want the game to be entirely digital or want to control the character token themselves or upload all their stats and manage them online or roll digital dice or want to have to pay for software. I'm with them, I just don't like it. They want to be able to see the map in front of them, describe where they want to move, then have me move their token. That, and fog of war, are literally all I need from a virtual tabletop. The ability to share my screen, show my map, and move a token around on top of it. If I could do it with a decent enough camera angle, I'd literally physically play out a map with miniatures, but I don't think they'd get enough detail from me videoing a printed map/model. I've tried Roll20 and it is just way way waaaay over engineered for what I need, and I couldn't find a reasonable way to do it without trying to get the whole team to buy in fully to the complete VT experience, which they won't do. For perspective, currently I'm just using photoshop, with each PC token as a layer, and moving them around whilst doing screen share. This is fine, but I have to be careful about them seeing the layers for the hidden bad guys that haven't entered the fray yet, etc. The main problem I have now is that there's no way to easily do Fog of War/unexplored terrain using this method, and we're about to hit a bunch of subterranean tunnels. Is there a really really super simple virtual tabletop that I can just upload maps and tokens to, with automatic fog of war? That's mostly all I need. If I could have multiple tokens for a shapeshifting moon Druid that would also be great, but not a requirement."

none,"On my first ever campaign. I've only done a 1 shot as a player thus far. I've poured HOURS of work into writing, reading, watching Critical Role and hanging out here. I've followed a couple of guides to put together my own campaign storyline (a rough plan for probably 12-20 adventure chapters, with key, consistent NPCs & BBEGs & Villains, the religion, maps, prophecies etc and a couple of extra races, magic items and monsters are my own, maybe loosely based on recognisable concepts but with a little spin) and have tweaked some standard tropes to fit my little universe. I've got somewhere in the range of 80 x A4 pages of backstory for the 300 or so years leading up to the arrival of my PCs on the scene, so that I could have a really clear idea in my head of all the motivations and histories of the NPCs I would be throwing at them. My logic is that if I know these characters and their motives and stories inside out, I'll feel more confident knowing how my they would react or behave. I've not written anything beyond the PCs meeting, but I have maybe 8 core NPCs, some of which are Villains/secret BBEGs, who all have plans of their own that will be chugging away in the background of whatever the party are doing. I'm super excited to be doing this, have loved every second of it so far, and really want to make it a great experience for the party - all of whom are also playing a full campaign for the first time. So I am hoping to prevail upon the much much more experienced players and DMs of Reddit to ask... what extra things can I do/add that will make this campaign amazing for my players?I have a Human (Moon) Druid with Wild Shape, a Half-Elf Fiend-Pact Warlock, a Half-Elf Rogue that is a bit of a Locke Lamora and a High Elf Ranger with plans to become a dragon tracker/hunter. Is there anything class/race related that I could do that is super fun that I might not know about? Things I could plan for later in the campaign rather than learning it as I go? (Eg does something happen with their classes at particular levels that I should plan for, like sudden strengths/weaknesses?). Are there specific magic items I can gift to particular characters that work incredibly well with their race/class? Has anyone played a particular kind of adventure that was just AMAZING? I'm starting with a murder mystery, have ideas for a heist, some dungeon diving, some dragon hunting, some intrigue and infiltration, some diplomacy missions, all sorts - all of which I will design around whatever the PCs are doing. But did you ever play an adventure that just blew you away with fun that I can work in? Maybe a one-shot where a Circus comes to town or a one-day festival or something? I just want to make this campaign amazing, and maybe crowd-source some genius level inspiration from you good folks."
none,"Hi all! I'm starting my first ever campaign this weekend, and I'm DMing it. I've got one potential scene for my 4x Level 2 characters that will see them coming upon an enemy camp where the total number of hostiles is going to be pretty substantial, but also hidden from the party. I.e. some will be in tents, some will be on patrols/watches out of immediate sight. In the event that my party rolls badly on any investigation/perception checks (or barrel in like a load of lunatics) and as such don't have a clear idea of exactly how many hostiles they are (and it's going to be TPK territory if they are dumb enough to try and attack head on), how would I handle rolling for initiative and instigating attacks when a large number of hostiles are unknown to the party? I've looked at page 194-195 of the Players Guide about unseen attackers, but it seems to mostly focus on when when the players themselves are hidden. Not when an unexpected enemy suddenly jumps out of the treeline. My plan if they do go for an attack is to just have them all grappled into submission and then imprisoned, but I'm just wondering how to actually play the lead up to that scenario in terms of storytelling vs. rollable actions. Would I just say, as you go to attack, you're surrounded by 12 extra guys you didn't see? Or would I play the whole thing out, do the Initiative Rolls for all the unseen combatants and then intro them into the order of attack with the benefit of surprise? Or place all of the unseen combatants automatically get higher initiative rolls and the benefit of surprise?[Edit: For Clarity, I don't want my guys to be able to overpower this group. It's purposefully set up to be waaaay too much for them to handle, but to teach them the lesson early-doors that they need to be careful jumping into attacks, and setting this particular band of extremely well trained mercenaries as a force to be reckoned with at a later point in the campaign. My question is more about how I handle the encounter if the PCs choose to actually attack this camp rather than going in calmly and asking questions, or stealthing in and interrogating a single person, or assessing that it is beyond their capabilities and abandoning it altogether.Would people recommend negating any attempts at attack altogether by having the party immediately immobilised before even bothering to roll for initiative, or let them try to attack and then having them quickly overpowered and imprisoned. I don't want it to seem too prescriptive, so I feel like I ought to let them roll for initiative and maybe even take/serve some damage in their attempts, but there's no way they ought to be actually winning this battle, if it turns into one. So then my question becomes, how do I actually run that logistically, if they haven't bothered to properly investigate the fact that there are more Mercenaries in and around the camp than they can actually see. I'm tending towards letting them roll for initiative, get in one round of surprise attacks on the people that they've identified, before promptly having the party be surprised from behind by the guys they hadn't spotted."
none,"Hi folks! I have some pre-made gridded maps that I'd done in photoshop and was just going to print out and use miniatures, but now that our game has moved online, is there a tool I can use to just upload my gridded maps and then the tool allows me to move them around the map online? Otherwise I'm just going to full screen photoshop and screen share me moving around tokens as transparent layers."

Once in beast form, the player can make a Call to the Wild” which will bring any same-genus animals to the battle by the start of the next turn. DM will play their actions as though they're NPCs on the side of the party and a dX (halp!) damage roll will determine the number of creatures that arrive. Links? Copypasta? Thoughts? Opinions?

Basically I'm looking for a magical item (I'll have it in amulet form but that's an easy reskin) that has the power to alert (only alert, not protect) the wearer when any form of deception magic is in their presence. I.e. the amulet will spin/vibrate/warm or something similar if someone or something in its presence is using a spell that is intended to deceive the wearer. Eg the current owner is terrified of being spied on, and uses it to alert him to invisible people in the room. Does any such/similar item exist? If not, does anyone have any advice/help they can give me to home brew it? TIA!"

none,"[EDIT] TLDR: I was whining. OMFG Version 0.33.0 I am hyperactively excited.___Bit of rage, yes, I realise. But it genuinely seems like every time something pops up that *finally* replaces the hole left by the 3 step glitch, Niantic shut it down.First, after days of frustration, some of us were able to rekindle some enjoyment in tracking 'Mon by taking a cheeky gander at PokeVision or a similar tracker. Then these were shut down. Then we discovered IV's, and the ability to do something more analytical than grind for candy came into play. Some genius guys out there create a tool that is able to rank and rate our Pokemon so that we can be more selective about what we evolve, hang on to and show off. The guys over at PoGo Profiles give us a handy manager tool so that we can see this all in one go - giving us a fab overview of all kinds of things that not only come in useful, but give us more of a reason to pick the game up, play and catch fodder.Not only that, it allows us to compare our 'Mon against our friends and compete with all other users on a global Gym ranking system, again, finding a way to make battling and training in Gyms worthwhile despite the glaring pointlessness of it the rest of the time. PoGo Profiles is so successful (read: Necessary to make the game fun again) that it has to shut down while the guys (who communicate!) desperately try to fix it up and make it scalable. So in the meantime I head over to PokeAdvisor for a similar IV rating service, until I can go back to PoGo Profiles. I'm able to use it for a grand total of 48 hours before Niantic shuts THAT down.WHY ARE THEY SHUTTING THESE SERVICES DOWN? Why aren't they going to these bright, entrepreneurial members of the community and saying ""Wow, guys, you've really hit on something there that resonates with players. How about we use some of these enormous stacks of cash that we're earning on a daily basis from in-game PokeBall purchases (lol, yeah, it's a ""glitch"" that Pokemon are now harder to catch! Wink wink)* - how about we take some of that money and buy your idea/hire you to come and work it into the game? People obviously seem to like it, and maybe it'll keep the masses happy whilst we put out all these other fires...""I swear to pikachu, this is beginning to drive me absolutely crazy. I've been mildly frustrated, I've walked KMs trying to track rare 'mon, I've  spent money buying in-game things to try and add an element of fun back into the game or to even make it playable (pokeballs, ffs). But now I am absolutely raging. Niantic, please stop waiting for us to find a reason to keep playing, and then snatching it away from us.[Edit]Just saying, guys, I'm aware that obviously third party sites contribute to the server loads that were originally impacting the likelihood of crashes. However, 1) Server issues seem to have been dramatically resolved despite the extra load of these sites and 2) Closing them down is one thing. Taking away functionality - externally provided or otherwise - that is getting resoundingly positive feedback from the community is another. Particularly when they're doing so without a) communicating what they could have done to prevent the closure (e.g. Take off the IV calculator but you can keep X features) b) stating that they're going to work it in to later updates on a timeline of X or c) utilising the resources provided to them in either the form of the tech itself or the people developing it... Well. I just think it could have been handled better. I know they're communicating a lot better than they have been, and I'm not ignoring that - but there's still more they could be doing on the community outreach front given that as [Lari-Fari](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4wp3r8/why_do_niantic_keep_banning_things_that_make_this/d68tcyp) pointed out below - the proportion of fans using these services are most likely the ones that are prepared to sink more money and effort into the game.[Edit 2]*A few people have now mentioned that the flee rate is of a greater significance to them than the number of balls they're wasting. I was basing this on personal experience; It seems that I'm flinging a lot more balls that whilst on target, are jumped over or batted away in the last split-second, or jumped out of altogether... Meaning I'm spamming up to 10 balls at a 'Mon that then runs away anyway, and ending up having to buy more. However it seems others are experiencing the flee rates before the pokeball wastage becomes an issue. Fair enough guys. Whatever problems this glitch is causing, we can all agree it's 100% annoying, whether it's a money-maker for Niantic or not. They've certainly made a few $ out of me since it started.& Minor text fixes."

none,"I was just wondering if anyone knew the purpose or conclusions to be drawn from a series of personality tests I recently undertook. As a group, we were not informed as to the purpose of conclusions to be taken from our behaviour in these tests, and I'm curious if anyone knows what these tests are/are for;1) We were asked to sort ourselves into age order without talking. What would be the relevance of having self-identified as being close in age to people vastly older/younger than yourself?2) We were asked to follow a series of verbal instructions, whilst watching counter actions. I.e. The leader would say ""touch your nose"" (and touch his nose), ""Touch your ear"" and touch his ear, ""raise your arm"" and raise his arm, then ""touch your nose"" and touch his EAR. What does it mean if you follow visual cues rather than verbal, and vice-versa?3) We were sorted into groups, and asked to decide which person in the group had the ""best secret"". Then decide who was going to tell that secret; the secret owner or someone else. That secret would then be presented by the group to another person, who would have to discern which member of the group the secret belonged to. Anyone know the relevance of a) who puts forward the ""best secret"", b) who verbalises the secret and c) whether they successfully ""fool"" the person trying to discern the person the secret belongs to?4) Giving a group the task of evicting one group member, for no pre-defined reason. What would be the relevance of a) being evicted unwillingly or b) someone volunteering to be evicted or c) being a person that decides/defines the reasons for evicting another (when technically, no ""reason"" exists).5) Having a group stand in a circle and create a story, one word at a time, by each adding one word to a sentence that has to be correctly remembered. E.g. Person 1: TherePerson 2: There oncePerson 3: There once wasetc.What would be the relevance of a) Being good/bad at this and b) ones' choice of wordI'm just really curious as to what I was being tested for, and I don't imagine I'll ever be told either the purpose or the results."

The one you emotionally and physicly abused and lied too.  So glad I never went past being your fiance, sad to say I'm glad you miscarried my baby. So glad I didn't allow you to isolate me from my friends and family so I could be thrown out in another town far away, while you ran off with some wife beater. I hope your life ends up being a living hell."

none,"Okay long story short, 4 years of lying and infidelity, 4 years of emotional and sometimes physical abuse. She ran off with the guy she was cheating with, they now have a kid together and another one on the way. So she got to work on me and hurt me, that's fine I chose to stay through that. We have mutual friends on social media so sometimes I unfortunatly get updates. Instead of rebounding to make people jelous or turning into a monster who does the same to every one else I get involved with, I took a step back. I've read books and done allot of soul searching, I put my life back together and worked on self love and everything else a decent person should. Just wanna know when I will finally heal and have zero care or energy for that person. When will or if I'll ever be like I was, before that person hurt and betrayed me."

none,"I spoke to a friend who happens to be a high priestess in her path, particularly on a work directed at my own body. She gave me a caution to about intent and what could happen if the intention was wrong, being as busy as she is, she left it on a vague note.   What are some of the dangers? And what are some precautions I could take, that would help me out with this experiment? The only idea I've come up with is being very specific with my petition, is that a good place to start?

All of you can say what you want, but I've never been hard to reach, I've never been too far away. I'm too crazy because I talk different, and I listen to different music, I wear different clothes and I have different values. That's fine you guys were never there to teach me your ways or your culture, you guys weren't there for graduations or swearing in ceremonies, you guys weren't there for triumph and heartbreak, you guys were never there. But I get it, it's my fault because I'm crazy .I'm crazy but somehow I can hold jobs and places to live somehow I can put myself through classes and get certifications, somehow I can live my life without hurting other people, somehow when you guys were at your lowest low when Papa died I forgave everything and showed up, I forgave everything and gave everyone another chance. Guess I was crazy for doing that. It's cool"

How would you feel about it if you had to think about it in a jail cell for the rest of your life? What if you accidently got the wrong guy? How would you feel about it, if you accidently shot someone's child or just some random person uninvolved in what you had going on?  If it's about money or machismo or even a woman it doesn't require a weapon to figure things out. Whoever you are, your an asshole for killing that man today.

none,"Hello dear friends, I invite you to sit and listen as I tell true stories. This year alone has been the worst year ever, and not on a macro level. I give a fuck about most people these days, been hurt enough trying to be kind. After I caught my fiance cheating on me last year, litterally the day after Thanksgiving, My truck caught fire along the fuel rail. It burned but not that bad. I bought all the damn parts, and everyone who said yeah I'll help you out not dice no show. The two mechanics I hired to do the job, they pretty much decided to not do the job, they decided to leave it half finished even though I paid them. Getting rides to work and sometimes having to wait 6 hours after I clock out to find a ride home. At this wonderfuk toxic work place, I get bit by a dog and he tears out a piece of my calves. I get a tetanis shot and then I get to hurt my back, to the point where I couldnt lift a damn thing. I work through all of that still show up still kick ass, still get unappreciated and underpaid. I meet this woman on the internet who is amazing, and according to her In the sunshine of her day, and we fit like a hand in a glove. She tells her older kids about me, she's 45, after that she calls things off.I lose my job, The day after I lost my job my grandfather died. I needed to get a ride to the rental car place. My Mom who is unemployed and my brother who was off, couldn't give me a ride. I had to pay an aquaintence to take me down to the rental place. Meanwhile My other living relatives were being funny on the phone and I overheard one of them say I was full of shit. I kept my peace I'm not the one who spent 18 years of my life treating me like a stranger. Everything after 18 I'll own. I race down there hoping to see my grandfather before he passed, got the call midway he's gone. I drive to that house and I do everything I can to be supportive, no drama everything's fine My grandfather wasn't even cold yet, and people were  trying to get cars cloths jewelry. Mind you apparently I'm the begger, Distasteful. We do the funeral and I leave. I go back to my broken truck and my ""loving"" family, a month later it's family dinner except I didn't get invited. The next month it's family dinner holiday edition, I couldn't make it. Not only could I not make it, I had to take my dog into the vet and put her down. I said screw it I'll ride a bike thirteen mike's into town everyday so I can look for work and commute if I find work. I search for a suitable bike, I find one I pay for it, but wait there's more......this bastard had a wonderful new scheme where they steal your bike before you even get it, so I got jacked. Now today Im on Facebook and I'm scrolling through and My grandma pops up in people I may know. Irs not enough people were absent and drama starting. They had to go the extra mile to give me some of that heartache.Tommorrow is Yom Kippur. I forgive G-d for this year. I forgive my family for never letting me down, when it comes to letting me down, I forgive my employers for their mistreatment. I forgive the dickheads who made that stupid virus, I forgive the mechanics and the bike thieves. Most important of all I forgive myself, I forgive myself for holding on to hope and hoping to love and be loved, I forgive myself for forgiving all those people, I ask that G-d takes all this pain and heartache that I feel right now I ask that G-d will take all this tikkun nefesh I worked through, and never hurt anyone like I got hurt ever again."

I buy her flowers every friday she starts a fight, because aparently I was covering somthing up, I stop she asks me to do it again, I do it again but its never good enough because she had to ask me. I buy three bouqets on her birthday she ghosts me. This has happened with a few things. She found someone else who claimed months, she told me 2 weeks. As I drove up there to fight this guy. I guess I was the only non cholo fake ass gangster she had ever been with. I guess it suprised her and him when I actually pulled up. He stayed outside, She came and met me. She wanted to hug me. I told her to go to hell, I told her the new guy could come outside. After all this Im still hurting my heart still wants her. Its like my hearts mantra come back baby come back.

none,"So to me its pretty obvious I have AGP, In my public life Im a very masculine person with a few masculine hobbies.  In my head and in my private life Im a very conflicted person.  Usually my conflict waxes and wanes, I get a girlfriend I dont wanna hear anything about agp,  of course after the endorphins wear off boom its back. When it comes back Im consumed, I spend allot of my focus on things like wdge heals and curves and etc, etc, etc,  then as we all know I do the ol five knuckle shuffle and boom for awhile the feelings go away.  So here is my Question it regards treatment. What are my options? Psychotherapy wonderful, Ive been to gender therapists twice. The first time I stopped because I left the country, The second time I got a girlfriend and stopped, because I realized wait a minute Im a manHormones Ive done the black market thing, it honestly made me feel at peace,  id melt that birth control under my toungue and then I was relaxed calm confident. Of course I stopped that because im a man. So okay now I know Im a man but my sexual targeting mechanism has been inverted to point towards me,  I climb the mountain and experiance the little death,  and It goes away for awhile but than it comes back....... Okay fast forward down the road Ive fought throughout my days but im old the kids are grown and Im alone. Do I wanna be that person that transistions after his youth or is there an effective way to treat agp where I dont have to take hormones?,  and if there isn't an effective way to do it without hormones than why the hell should I wait ?"

none,"I left my sons father 2 months ago as he was extremely abusive. I'm a single mom, with no money (because of him), I was a stay at home mother- I'm literally rebuilding my life from the ground up. I have no other choice but to stay with my mother and she is extremely narcissistic and toxic. Every time I stand up for myself or express myself I'm sick in the head” or mentally ill”. She's even called me a pathetic mother, after the horror I went through with my sons father and leaving BY MYSELF. How do I get through this? I have no friends because my ex drove them all away. I only have her. She makes me so depressed to the point where I have suicidal thoughts. I'm interviewing for jobs and trying to find childcare. I just don't even know where to go from here I feel so depressed and lost."
none,"It's infuriating. This person abused me emotionally, financially, and towards the end physically. He would come home drunk in the middle of the night, scream, throw furniture, call me names and intimidate me. The last time he did this, about 2 months ago, I called the police, and the next day I broke our lease and left without a warning. Last night out of the blue he contacted me saying he was in a new relationship (which is actually a lie-his family member told me he isn't seeing anyone) and to stay the fuck out of his life” and that I had my chance to be with him and I ruined it. We have a son together and not once since we left has he asked about him. My question is, do these people truly believe that they are this amazing prize and us victims lost” them? Or is it all an act? I can't tell if he's saying that because he believes it or if he just wants me to."
none,"After joining Reddit and reading more about narcs I think she may be one and that may be why we have such a turbulent relationship. All throughout my young teen years she would comment on my weight and then blame me for being sensitive. Or tell me I should look more like my friends”. As an adult, I've noticed her more aggressive side. A few months ago she went into a rage at me, screaming at the top of her lungs, saying fuck you, get the fuck out of my house, etc. after I left and didn't speak to her for a month, she takes no responsibility and just blames me for hurting her because I didn't talk to her. She called me a pathetic mother” (I'm a new mom) and when I told her how much that hurt me she said well you've said a lot of hurtful things to me too”. She blames all of our arguments on me 100% and says there's absolutely nothing wrong with her”. I've battled depression for years and she calls me sick in the head” when referring to my depression. Does this seem like narcissistic traits of a parent?"
none,Everything just hurts. I can't stop crying. He was my only friend (despite the constant emotional and financial abuse). I'm so lonely now. I left with our son and he hasn't tried to reach out. Not even to see how our son was doing. I miss the part of him I loved. I'm so tempted to reach out but I know I can't. A part of me is scared to death to hear from him. I'm so sad I don't know how to cope anymore
none,"I left my nex 2 months ago. During our relationship he turned me into someone who lies to everyone. He turned me into someone who cried everyday and questioned every intuition I had. He turned me into someone who begs and apologized when I didn't do anything wrong.  He turned me into an angry, sad, vengeful person. I left him, but I'm still very much dealing with the aftermath. I'm so angry at everyone. I'm always sad. I'm paranoid. I'm broken.Any advice or words of encouragement helps. I feel like I will never be normal again."
none,"I noticed with my narc that he would always say how he was terrified of being cheated on because every girlfriend he has been with has cheated on him.. but during our relationship he cheated on me, and he cheated on each ex before me. I spoke to both women and they each had some horribly traumatic stories about how he cheated. Do people like this cheat for their entire life?"
none,One time a few months into our relationship he randomly said to me that he thinks he's crazy” and that he has extremely low self esteem” when I pressed him about this further he changed the subject and never brought it up again. Is it possible this was a moment of self awareness?
none,Or do they start to believe that we actually are?
none,Today I was doing some reflecting and I remembered one incident that really upset me. He had been chatting on the phone with a girl we had both worked with (he knew her much better than me) and when he told me about the phone call he said I think I have feelings for her ” and when I freaked out and got upset he said I meant as a friend?? Relax” was I overreacting or was that him trying to hurt me on purpose?
none,"We're just both toxic and aren't meant for each other” I can't wait until I find a girl who can give me a normal relationship” You're the abusive one” My nex said these things to me all the while abusing me physically, emotionally, and financially throughout our whole relationship. Have you experienced this as well? I know I'm not toxic but I sometimes fell into his way of behaving, I think as a way to survive. He would call me fat, ugly, worthless and if I called him an idiot back, I was the mean/abusive one."

none,"Why is it so hard to face the reality of who these people really are? I find myself wondering how the sweet, funny, caring person I loved could also be so malicious, dishonest, and honestly just straight up evil. I struggle with the idea that maybe he'll treat the next girl better and that maybe he just loved to torment me because of who I am. I struggle to accept that the man who is the father of my son would terrorize me and once I left, didn't even bother to ask how his son was doing.  But he was able to harass and threaten me. I guess I'm just venting, today's been a tough day. Thanks for reading."
none,"I left 2 months ago. My sons [8mo] father [26m] has always been emotionally abusive to me. Called me ugly, worthless, easily replaceable, every degrading term you can think of. He would empty our joint bank account when he was mad at me. His drinking started to become an all day every day event. One night he came home drunk and high, screaming and throwing things. He broke down the bathroom door. He never hit” me or hurt our son, but would grab me hard enough to leave bruises. He put sharp objects under my tires. He would talk to our son and say son, isn't your mommy fucking crazy?” I ended up calling the cops the one night and an investigation with social services was opened. I was scared to death so the next day while he was at work, I left. I moved 3 states away and he doesn't know where we are. We are currently no contact and I changed my number. My question is, even though he was awful to me, did I do the right thing for my son? Is it possible that these types of men can be good fathers? I want my son to have a father, but at what cost. He has another child with a different woman that he has never met, and now I feel like I made a mistake letting him be a part of my sons life at all."

none,"And if so, in what ways? Emotional/physical?"
none,"I left my narc ex about 2 months ago. We've been no contact. He has a history of restraining orders and stalking his exes (something I recently learned) I feel like everyday I'm just waiting for him to randomly show up and scare me or even try to hurt me. Or even just contact me, which also scares me because he can be threatening. We have a son together so I think it's extremely unlikely that he'll stay away forever. I moved 3 states away but he's made threats before saying I know where you live”. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I just wish he would stay away forever."
none,"My now ex partner [26m] and I [26f] lived together and have a baby. On Mother's Day he came home drunk and high on adderall in the middle of the night and started screaming and throwing things. He then left the house (because I called the police) and got into a bar fight, breaking a beer glass over someone's head. He's always been emotionally abusive at times (calling me fat, worthless, unattractive, easily replaceable), will threaten to leave me for someone else, empties our bank account when he's mad, calls me lazy if I don't want to have sex with him.. if I had stayed, would things have escalated to him hitting me? He's grabbed me to the point of bruising but he's never hit. He's downloaded texting apps in order to harass me, and he's even used them to text himself to make it look like he was texting a girl. And showed me, saying look, I have other girls if you don't start behaving”. He broke the door down when I was in the bathroom with his phone. He's not even sorry, saying it's all my fault and I was wrong for calling the police. After the incident on Mother's Day, I was crying all the next day and he said what's your problem? I'm going to buy you flowers right now. You need to relax”. The police recommended I get out of the relationship based on his record of having a 2 restraining orders against him (both from the same woman). I've been gone for a few weeks staying with my parents. I'm a stay at home mom and in a really tough spot. I wish he would get help but I need to protect my son. Please no rude comments.. unless you've been in this situation you don't know how hard it is. I realize this is probably an easy question to answer- but he's made me doubt a lot of things, including my own intuition."

And showed me, saying look, I have other girls if you don't start behaving”. He broke the door down when I was in the bathroom with his phone. He's not even sorry, saying it's all my fault and I was wrong for calling the police. After the incident on Mother's Day, I was crying all the next day and he said what's your problem? I'm going to buy you flowers right now. You need to relax”. The police recommended I get out of the relationship based on his record of having a restraining order against him. I've been gone for a few weeks staying with my parents. I'm a stay at home mom and in a really tough spot. I wish he would get help but I need to protect my son. TIA."
none,"Such as their occasional kind words/actions, their claim to love and care for you/their children, etc."
none,"Right before I left my ex, I had a few days of him absolutely terrorizing me. Coming home drunk, calling me names, throwing furniture, breaking down the door because I had his phone. At one point he locked me out of our house and I went into absolute panic because our son was inside with him and he was in a rage. Although he hadn't hit me (yet) his behavior was extremely erratic and I ended up leaving before he started abusing me that way. I keep having nightmares of him locking me out and feeling that panic in the dream. It feels so real. Has anyone else experienced this? It's been awful."
none,"Not trying to apologize to me, or even ask how his son is doing. Nope. He's made 2 Instagram accounts now trying to add me, I'm assuming to snoop on me and see pictures of me and our son. I left 2 months ago and the last time we spoke he lied to me about having a new girlfriend. Isnt this weird? Like at least have a little dignity and send me a message, not just try to spy on me."
none,"I left him 2 months ago. He hasn't even tried to reach out to see how his son is. He was terrible at the end.. came home drunk, yelled at me, threw furniture, said I'm not woman enough for him” and that he was going to leave me for a Latino girl because a Latino girl could satisfy him in the ways that I can't”. He blames me for calling the cops and says that I ruined the relationship. He offered to be roommates” so that I can show him that I can be a good girlfriend again”.. how can I even miss someone like this? I feel crazy. I feel sad for our son. Do you think people like this ever change and treat the next partner better?"
none,"Just wondering because I've read that narc abusers never apologize”, but I would think that they have to sometimes in order to keep up their appearance..For example, my narc ex would apologize like this- I'm so sorry I just don't even want to be alive anymore because I can't live without you” and then days or weeks later he would do the exact thing he was originally sorry” for."
none,"I'm just genuinely curious- my ex who is a serious narc abuser lost me and our son about 2 months ago. He's had 2 other serious relationships that ended badly, the same as us. He has another child with an ex he has no relationship with because of his abusive ways. I just always hear that these people never change because they benefit” from abusing partners, but at what point would someone realize wow, I have 2 kids I have no relationship with because of how I behave, maybe I should take responsibility for things..”?"
none,"The last night we were together before I left him (2 months ago) he came home in the middle of the night drunk and high. His friend dropped him off at home and I was trying to go outside to speak to the friend about what had happened and what drugs he did. As I was trying to walk out the door, my ex got in front of me and was physically restraining me from going to speak with his friend. I was trying to push past him but he was blocking me from getting out of the door. He's not a big guy but definitely bigger and stronger than me. I was clearly just worried/concerned. Is this considered physical abuse? Just doing some reflecting and I was curious. Thanks"
none,"Or, are they capable of having a normal, healthy, loving relationship?"
none,I don't get it.
none,When will the self blame end? When will I stop blaming myself for calling the cops and accept the fact that his actions caused the hardship? When will I stop believing his words of we hurt each other” and accept that he is the one hurting me. When will I forgive myself for calling him an idiot that one time when he's called me every name in the book? When will it get better? I can't handle the blame anymore
none,"I left my abusive ex about 2 months ago. I left with our son and we haven't said a word to each other since. Yesterday I received a follow request from an Instagram profile that had clearly just been created, as it had no followers or photos. The username was his name and my sons name. I quickly blocked and reported the account. He was extremely abusive and scary and I know he has a history of stalking other exes. Should I be concerned? Why would he be doing that? I made it really clear that he should never contact me again"
none,"I'm seeing a therapist but it seems like a slow process. I've NEVER been the type of person to get angry or overreact but since experiencing the trauma of an abusive relationship I definitely have a short fuse. I've been acting really mean towards people at times. I feel terrible, like maybe I'm an abusive person just like my ex. Has anyone else experienced this? Any insight helps. Thanks"
none,"I left him with our son [7mo] about 2 months ago. I haven't heard a word from him at all, not even about our son or wanting to see him/asking how he's doing. Is this something that they do? I know he's furious that I left and that I now see him for who he truly is.. but wouldn't any decent man check in with how his son is doing? Regardless of how much he hates the child's mother? Or is he unable to separate his feelings of hatred? Any insight helps. I'm hurt over the whole relationship but I'm especially hurt that my sons father seems to not care about him at all."
none,"I left him about 6 weeks ago, and he has never reached out. Not even to ask about his son. He hurt me, I don't understand how I ended up being hated by him. He said that everything is my fault because I called the cops and that I would have to pay all the bills so he could get a lawyer for the assault charge. I left one day while he was at work with our son and the bare essentials. With no warning to him at all. How can he just move on? Not even care about his son? How can I miss someone who hurt me in every way imaginable? Why does he hate me, when I didn't do anything wrong? I guess I'm mostly just venting"
none,"Whether it was starting an argument, coercing me/ bullying me for sex, or just being loud because he was drunk, almost every night I was awake with him multiple hours. Anyone else experience this? Is it another common behavior of abusers? TIA"
none,"And, when they've grabbed so hard that they leave a bruise, and have attempted to break down a door. Is it really possible that an abuser like this can do all those things and still never hit someone, because to him, THAT one thing makes him abusive, but not the other stuff?"
none,"I don't even know why exactly, he hadn't hit me- yet. But things were escalating. He went from only verbal abuse to emotional and financial. It also got to the point where he broke down a locked door to the room I was in and coming home drunk throwing stuff. His drinking got worse and worse and I believe he started using cocaine. Things were escalating to where he would bruise my arms and legs from grabbing me and I was calling the cops on him. He would leave the house before the cops got there and then harass me over text all night. Am I crazy to think that people like this have the potential to seriously harm their partners? Side note: my son and I are away and safe. Just doing some reflecting. TIA "
none,"Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. I left my abuser a month ago and I still think about how it seems like I'm the only person in his life that he treated like garbage. He was always so sweet to his mom, his sister, or any other woman that he would interact with. To them, he's a totally normal nice guy. But when it was just him and I, he was totally different. Called me terrible things, gaslighted, would attempt to break down the door if I ever locked myself in a room (even the bathroom) threw objects, was financially controlling, among many other things. Side note: I know that he was this way with his other exes. But why can he be so nice and loving to women/people who aren't his partner? His family literally doesn't believe anything I have told them about his behavior or what his exes have told them. They think we're all crazy and that he's a good guy."
none,Someone who is trying to break down a locked door to get into the room you're in
none,"Looking back on my extremely abusive and turbulent relationship, there were a few times that he [26m] couldn't find something like his shoes or his hat and would be all annoyed that he would be late for work. I genuinely had no idea where they were and helped him look with no luck. When he got home from work he went upstairs and found them, each time, right on the floor in our bedroom. there's NO way they were there. He then would say how could you have missed them, they were right here ” but I swear there's no way I could have missed them from where he said they were. Is it possible that he hid them on purpose? Why would someone do that? That's the only thing I can think of because it doesn't make any sense."
none,"I left my abusive ex about a month ago. I've been doing some reflecting and one incident I cannot forgive myself for. One night, my ex was verbally and emotionally abusing me with very hurtful words and I finally snapped. I punched his leg and yelled at him to shut up. Right after I did it I was horrified. I've never hit anyone in my life. Right after I did it, he started saying look, you're the abusive one, not me” and wait until my family hears how you abuse me”. I was crying and so apologetic I felt terrible. He never accepted my apology and from that night on I was deemed an abuser in his eyes.Side note: when I hit him, it was not a very hard hit at all. Didn't leave a mark and it definitely didn't scare him. ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT IT WAS VERY WRONG. Any insight helps. TIA"
none,"I've already broken up with him for a lot of reasons, he was very abusive emotionally and verbally. Looking back on our relationship, there were 2 times that I told him I was afraid of him because of his erratic behavior and his history of having a restraining order against him.. and his response was extreme anger and blocking me. Is this weird? Why would someone act that way to such a concern? We have a son together so even though I left him I expect him to pop back in at some point. TIA."
none,"Just left my ex about a month ago and we haven't spoken since, I had been doing well until today I've been crying all day. He was TERRIBLE to me, some people even describe him as evil. Called me the worst names imaginable. Used our son against me in arguments. Would come home drunk and trash the house. Would verbally abuse me if I didn't have sex with him. Started to be physically intimidating and lied constantly. He was the gaslighting champ. But even with all that, there was a time when this person was my best friend. The person who seemed to care the most, in between the bad times. Am I crazy? I'm not trying to sound stupid or naive. I know this person is no good. I loved him so much and I tried so hard. I don't know how I'm gonna get through this."
none,"Just got a case closed out on my family, my sons father was the perpetrator for household violence (don't worry, we left him 😊) and the closing letter stated that the services recommended were substance abuse treatment and domestic violence treatment. Just wondering if that's the same thing as batterers intervention. Thanks!"
none,"My abusive ex [26m] has a history of using texting apps to harass me. We broke up a month ago. The other day I got some SMS messages from someone claiming to be Nadia”  his new girlfriend” telling me that they're happy and not to bother to reach out to him ever again. I happen to be friends with his other ex, and she told me that he used to do that to her, and Nadia was a made up person to make her upset. When I call the number, it rings a bunch and then says this voicemail box is not set up yet”. And when I searched the number online it says it's a landline. Could this be from a texting app? I'm so annoyed with these games.."
none,"Left my [26f] abusive ex [26m] a month ago. He was extremely abusive emotionally, financially, verbally and had just started to become physical. I left one day while he was at work, changed my number, and we haven't spoken since. I know he's FURIOUS at me, as one of our mutual friends told me he said that he'll never f-ing talk to me again”. I moved 3 states away to be with my family. He hasn't even tried to find out how our son [7mo] is doing. He seems to have completely moved on and doesn't even care about the hell he put me and his son through. Am I crazy for feeling sad? I'm glad to be away from him but at the same time I can't understand why it was so easy for him to lose his family. Almost like my son and I weren't good enough for him. I cannot imagine going an entire month and not even trying to ask about my son..Side note: I am happy he's out of our life, I know it's for the best. It just feels like a slap in the face and I can't help but wonder why.."
none,"In the last few weeks, after leaving my very abusive ex (emotionally, psychologically, financially, physically) I'm starting to forget the details of certain things he said and did to me.. how can this be? Am I crazy? It's like the memories are fading with each day, no matter how hard I try to remember I can only vaguely remember instances. I remember he called me terrible things like crazy, whore, fat, worthless, etc. but I can't remember the specific situations. What's going on?"
none,"Is this a normal thing to think about? He abused his last girl friend too, and the one before that. Emotionally, financially, physically. Called all of us terrible names. Cheated. Gaslighted. Stalked and harassed. The emotional abuse was the worst part for me personally. Called me the worst names possible and would tell me there's a million other girls who are prettier and better. Called me fat right after I had his child. I ran his business, got us our house, paid the bills, took care of our son. He basically did nothing and yet he criticized everything I did. He went to rehab a year ago, where he participated in therapy for 5 hours a day. Even that didn't help anything. Is there even a chance that someone like this could move on to another woman and treat her the way I longed him to treat me for so long? Might be a silly question, idk. TIA."
none,"I don't know why I'm sad.. he's terrible, he put me through so much. Emotionally, psychologically.. constant sexual manipulation and physical intimidation. Today he contacted me just to tell me that he found someone new and that she's better. (Although, I think it's a bluff- he sent a photo of himself with a girl from at least 5 years ago. He was much younger in the picture.) He didn't even ask how our son [7mo] is doing. He didn't even acknowledge his existence. He just contacted me solely to hurt me. I changed my phone number so he contacted me through email.Why am I sad if I know he's terrible? Any insight helps. Thanks."
none,"I just left my abusive ex a month ago. I left without warning and we haven't said a word to each other since. Although, I know he is VERY mad. I feel that the only way I'm going to get closure is if I send him a letter through email telling him how much he hurt me emotionally and psychologically. I now live 3 states away so he doesn't have access to me anymore. Is this a good idea? I'm trying really hard to move on, I just have so much on my mind that I want to get out."
none,"Long story short, I just left my VERY abusive ex [26m] a month ago. He abused me one night, the cops came and arrested him, and the next day I left with my son, giving him no warning. We haven't said a word to each other since, which is very out of character. Whenever we've had an argument, broken up, or taken a break, he contacts me almost to the point of harassing me. But not this time. it's been complete radio silence. I should mention that I changed my number and deleted social media, but he's gone so far as to contact me through PayPal in the past. He's pretty crafty. I'd like to move on with my life and not be afraid of when he will reach out, but I feel like if I let my guard down it may hit me harder if/when he does. My son and I are safe and in a good environment now, but I'm definitely suffering from some PTSD. I'm TERRIFIED to hear from him. It's his son too, I should probably mention. I'm Just trying to figure out what I should expect in the coming months. I'm constantly stressed and anxious. TIA."
none,"After leaving an extremely abusive relationship (emotionally, financially, physically) I'm doing a little reflecting and I noticed one thing that I didnt think abusers did.. but every time I did anything wrong or we were arguing he would threaten to end the relationship and find someone better and more beautiful”. He would say I'm so done with you” and you lost me” or you lost what every woman would kill to have”. Do abusers do this often? Is it a control tactic? I don't hear of abusers doing this often, I thought most of them feared a breakup. Any insight helps. "
none,"I just recently left my ex and I've been doing some unpacking of the relationship. He was abusive emotionally and financially. But I recall on more than one occasion, in the middle of the night, he would ask for sexual favors and I would say no, maybe tomorrow, it's late and I'm trying to sleep. On one occasion he said I'm sorry, do you go to work everyday or do you sit on your ass at home all day? (I'm a stay at home mom) Why the fuck would you be tired?” The other time he said why do you have to be so fucking lazy” and he went and slept on the couch. This seems  not normal to me? It really hurt my feelings and both times I cried the rest of the night."
none,"Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy and that I abused my recent ex [26m] just as he abused me. One night when he was torturing me emotionally and psychologically, I went at him and hit his leg and yelled at him to shut up. He told me that I was the abusive one and that I don't deserve him. I was horrified at what I had done, I've never hit anyone. I literally just felt like a caged animal who had to fight back. It was the worst feeling. He abused me emotionally, financially, and towards the end he used physical intimidation. Is it possible that I was abusive to him too? I thought abuse was about power and control.. and both people can't have P&C. Any insight helps"
none,"I just recently left my sons father, about a month ago. He was abusive emotionally, financially, and had recently become physically as well. When I left, I was scared he would hurt us so I left while he was at work one day and came to stay with my parents. I changed my number. We haven't said a word to each other since, he basically just came home to us gone. I can't help but wonder if he misses us. Is that bad? I hate that I think that way. It's strange, usually in an argument he blows up my phone, usually on social media. But it's been complete radio silence. Although I imagine it won't last because I have our son. It's a lot to process. Please don't be mean this has all been really difficult for me. TIA."
none,"I left my sons father [26m] about a month ago. Doing some reflecting and I never considered financial abuse was present as I was more focused on the other stuff, but.. we had a joint bank account and he would always keep only 200-300 dollars in it. Whenever we would argue he would completely empty the account. I got a nice chunk of a tax return and as a result he made me pay for EVERYTHING besides our rent. He even wanted me to pay that too but I refused. I'm a stay at home mom, something we both decided was best, and I wanted to put that money into savings. Instead I was forced to pay for all our date nights, groceries, utilities, baby stuff, etc. he makes about 6k a month and I never saw any of that money. I have no clue where it went. TIA."
none,"Hi, this is my first time dealing with CPS. My sons father became physically abusive for the first time a month ago and I left right away. He had always been somewhat verbally abusive to me behind closed doors but never to our son [7mo]. The police called CPS and a case was opened. Even though I left immediately, after the first physical incident, and I've gone to therapy just as they asked, my social worker seems to think that I've done something wrong or that I'm being suspicious because I simply asked for an update on when our case would be closed. I moved away from my sons father and I'm living with my family, exactly how she asked me to. When I asked about the update on the case she responded is there a reason why you're in a rush to get this closed?” Like.. no? This is incredibly stressful for me? Is that not obvious? I wasn't the offending parent so it just seems weird that she would treat me this way."
none,"I just left my ex who was very abusive in every way. Towards the end, especially when I was more resentful and wanting my dignity back, I started lashing out at him more when he was being abusive. He would call me a name and I would just lose it and cuss him out. Then he would call me abusive. Am I abusive? I've never been like that, I've never tried to do anything to hurt anyone like that, but at the end I felt so powerless I would do anything to gain power back. It's a terribly confusing feeling."
none,"Just left my abusive ex [26m] about a month ago. The last incident that made me leave was the night before Mother's Day (my first Mother's Day) he came home drunk and started screaming and throwing furniture. I called the cops and they made him leave. He then went to the bar and harassed me through text all night. The next day he came home and instead of apologizing he demanded to look through my phone (for what reason I have no idea?) we fought over my phone and he ended up breaking it. He left again, harassed me over text again saying he was going to hangout with another girl and that I lost him”. I had enough. I was done. While he was away from the house I broke our lease (it was only in my name), I hired a moving coming to take all our stuff and donate it, and I left the state with our son. We haven't said a word to each other since. Do people like this ever feel remorse? This was a nightmare for me. I cried all day on my first Mother's Day, dealt with cops, child services. Etc. his family thinks I'm a monster for leaving the way I did. They enable and justify his abuse. any insight helps. Thank you"

Often when he was drunk) his family would stand up for him and enable his behavior, often telling me that I'm just as much to blame or he's just blowing off steam” When I left, I filed a restraining order against him and I texted all of them that they were no longer welcome in my or my sons life and to never reach out to me again. Was this a good idea? Im not trying to punish his family, they didn't abuse me. I'm trying to protect my son and I feel that any relationship with my exes family would inevitably lead back to him.

He didn't hit me, but he came home drunk and high and started throwing things full force, such as the baby swing. I called the cops and he fled. This incident led to me being scared he would come home and hurt me, child services got involved, and I ended up breaking our lease and moving away with no notice to him. Child services told me it would be best to stay away from him looking at his record. It's all very shocking. But he blamed me for all of it. Said it was my fault for calling the police and that he deserves better than me. How do you recover from something like this? Do people like this ever feel remorse? TIA."
none,"A few weeks ago I left my sons father, a very abusive man who put me through hell. I had to pack up an entire apartment and leave in a day, go to the courthouse for a restraining order, and then drive 5 hours to stay with this friend for a few days. All with my 6 month old son. I was completely traumatized and in shock over what happened, and during my stay this friend constantly mom shamed me. She treated me like I was stupid for not knowing what Gripe water was. She told me in a snobby way that I should sanitize his bottles every day and do it with a special thing she owns. She told me I needed to bathe and change my son more often and said, after I told her I felt like a bad mom, maybe you should do better” would you continue to be friends with her? I try to forget about it but I can't stop feeling angry. I had just been beaten down by my sons dad and it felt like she was doing the same thing. Side note: I ran everything she told me I was doing wrong over with the pediatrician. He said I was doing everything completely fine."
none,"My ex boyfriend would throw things with a lot of force when he was mad at me. Things as small as a cup of febreze bottle, or as big as a baby swing. But he never hit” me, per say.

Just doing some reflecting and trying to process. TIA"
none,"Just recently left my ex because he was verbally, emotionally, and financially abusive. Towards the end he used physical violence towards objects to intimidate me but never actually hit me. He was notorious for gaslighting and a pathological liar. He would go out to the bar and get in bar fights. He has drinking and drug problems. His previous girlfriend had restraining orders against him. The girlfriend before that has similar stories with him. My question is, do people like this ever change? We have a son together but I need to do what is best for my son. I've never experienced anyone like this so I really have no idea how people like this turn out. Thanks"
none,"My son was born in Florida, and when he was 3 months old I took him to NC to be with his father. His father ended up being very abusive in every way. I moved back to Florida to be with my parents when LO was 5 months old. He is not on the BC and has texted me saying he doesn't want to raise him. Now all of a sudden I hear he's going to try to pursue custody or visitation. LO is 7 months old. What are the odds he could be successful? He has another child he has no relationship with, a criminal record, restraining orders, debt, a history of violence and stalking. No money. I am desperate to keep my son away from him. He is a bad guy and will bring nothing of value to his life. TIA."

There were 2 incidents where he was calling me names and degrading me so bad I would punch his arm or leg and yell at him to stop calling me those names. I felt terrible after. I've never been like that.. I just kind of snapped after being called terrible things for so long.  It was never a punch that left a mark but a punch nonetheless. After I did it, he would say i beat” him and continue to degrade me. I would cry for hours because I felt so bad for hitting him. He made me feeling like everything was my fault.

He then left the house (because I called the police) and got into a bar fight, breaking a beer glass over someone's head. He's always been emotionally abusive at times (calling me fat, worthless, unattractive), will threaten to leave me for someone else, keeps money from me, calls me lazy if I don't want to have sex with him.. but this is the first time he's done anything like this. Will things escalate to him hitting me? He's grabbed me to the point of bruising but he's never hit. He's not even sorry, saying it's all my fault and I was wrong for calling the police. The police recommended I get out of the relationship based on his record of having a restraining order against him. I'm a stay at home mom and in a really tough spot. TIA."
none,When they finally left the room without really hurting you and you are just on pins and needles waiting for them to bust open the door.
none,"When I'm on the app, I can't see my May Glam Bag X under the past bag glam bag” feature. I can see past glam bags or glam bag plus going back to January 2020. Does anyone know why they would make this feature unavailable to Glam Bag X members?"
none,Did anyone else order this? I can't remember if it was a flash sale or shopper offer. It said it came with a free bonus item. Just curious what the bonus item is since mine was missing.
none,Does anyone know anything about the Sophia & Mabelle primer being offered in $3 add ons?  Or the brand in general?  I don't see the primer on their website but Ipsy says its a full sized $16 value item.
none,"My favorite perfume is long discontinued and the last time I tried to order a dead stock bottle on eBay for stupid money, it had gone off.  From what I can find, the top notes were pervasive and were pomegranate, lemon, green leaves, and black pepper.  Middle was less pervasive but floral - violet, orchid, magnolia, rose, freesia, and ginger flower.  Base notes were woody, sandalwood, musk, cedar, and also Iris.  The scent was overall light and fresh from the top notes, but had a lot of throw which I attribute to the middle notes and sexy which I attribute to the base.  Maybe I am grasping at straws here but can anyone recommend an indie that might hit these attributes?  Or even a combo that I could layer to find the balance?"
none,Has anyone tried the Hollywood or Bollywood setting powders and if so how are they? Also am I crazy or did they used to make a product designed to increase the life and/or throw of your perfume? I don't see it on the site now. Are there similar products available elsewhere?
none,Has anyone tried this? Is it good?
none,"Location - Georgia. I was driving on a public street that has a large live oak canopy extending out over the road. A limb fell and damaged the roof of my car. Luckily no broken glass or injuries, although a few seconds could have made a big difference. As it is, just a dent and scratches. Does the county who owns the trees have any responsibility for the damage to the car? If so what should be my next steps. I took pictures of the down limbs and filed a police report to document the incident. There was no storm or wind, so I assume the limbs that fell were dead and in need of trimming back. Thanks in advance for any advice."
none,"I just used the code Peelback for early access which began at 11:30 EST.  It includes a $75 professional home peel kit for $45.  I am not getting it, but hopefully someone else needs this and can enjoy it.  I am not sure if the code will work if you didn't get the email with the early access shopping link,"
none,"For years I was reluctant to buy the original Too Faced Chocolate Bar palette because Temptalia rated the two shades I liked most: Candied Violet and Black Forest Truffle, with an F and C+ respectively.  Her complaint about candied violet was it was too sheer. I found the palette new and sealed in box at TJ Maxx recently for $19.99 so I took a chance. I love candied violet! The subtle purple on the lid makes my hazel eyes look 3 shades greener. Does anyone else have a favorite product that other people review poorly?"
none,Has anyone ever spent time in a particular house or other location that made you particularly witchy? Where your powers felt stronger? Did it have to do with the location or the people who were there with you? Curious!
none,"I am early 50s & have an old friend who I love and respect. She moved around a lot (hubs is a coast guard pilot) and had 1 daughter who is around 20/21. The girl went to college on a swimming scholarship. She called me out of the blue today (repeatedly) and when I finally picked up, she proposed a virtual cutco demo that she's already being paid for because it's a training” in which I don't have to buy anything. If it was someone my age, I would have shut them down in a heartbeat but I can't be mean to someone's daughter (I have kids of my own a similar age). I agreed to watch her demo tomorrow. What do I say if it's a hard sell, not being in the market for knives?"
none,"Has anyone tried this palette? I've been intrigued by the black primer changing the shadow color, but not sure if it's more of a gimmick."
none,"Ipsy just added an 1800 point Real Her I Feel Beautiful palette to the points redemption part of the site.  Not for me, but I know a lot of people have been waiting on some new items on the points page."
none,"I am considering going to every other month on plus. If I do this now, I would get July and my next plus would be September. What is the last date I can make this choice if I don't want the August bag? Do I have until July 31 or would it have to be done sooner? Also considering adding regular glam bag. If I want it to start in August, what date do I need to add it by being that don't want a regular bag  in July (since I'm already getting a plus bag)? Is this best done under another account or the same one, assuming I want the same profile to apply?"
none,How often do they update the products available for points? Do members get a notification when they do?
none,I bought a used book on EBay recently and it reeks of smoke. Like it was salvaged from a house fire. I can't even be in the same room with it much less read it. I sell on eBay too and don't want to be an asshole and leave negative feedback or even demand my money back since it was only $5. Should I let the seller know? They are a high volume top rated” seller with literally millions of feedback but hundreds are negative.
none,"I am 53 and besides hereditary dark undereye circles, I don't really have major skin issues. I don't typically need or wear full coverage except concealer. Hydrating concealers like It cosmetics bye bye undereye set with a little powder work better for me than other formulas. I was thinking of buying the perfecting skin tint and concealer duo but curious if anyone has experience with these products over age 40. Most of the ads look like it's geared to younger people."
none,"I signed up for Allure May 19 and was assured by CS that I would get May's box as my first box, to ship in early June. I have not received the box yet or any sort of shipping notice. I can't find anywhere in my account with shipping info. Is this normal? When do they typically ship during the month?"
none,"So just before covid, I went in a thrift store in a nearby town (upscale coastal retirement). Found a Nora Fleming dotted Swiss sandwich tray that came with a glass front case filled with seasonal ornaments that you can insert in the tray and change out depending on the occasion. The whole thing was $25 for tray, 11 ornaments, and case. I had no plans to flip it. It seemed cute but not over the top. I had already used it 1-2 times before it occurred it me to look up the value. So wow, several of the ornaments are discontinued and expensive!  I only look at sold” prices on eBay and this set, if parceled out as singles is worth around $1300. With the ornaments being worth $100-$400 each for the more rare ones and $15-50 for the other and the tray and case selling well as stand alones. Torn here because I was just buying for me!"
none,"Hi all! So, I am intrigued with the skin tint concept. I'm 53 but don't need much coverage except dark circles and normally only wear powder except for under eyes. I tried IT cosmetics but the bb cream was too much coverage for all over. Their bye bye undereye hydrating concealer is pretty good for me but I'm always looking for something better. Any ideas how glossier might work on more mature skin? Also in the concealer, they are currently out of the shades that fall between lightest and medium and I think I'm in between. I could wait for a restock. I would love a glowy natural look that also hid my circles! I would love honest feedback on how it might work for me."
none,"So mid-May I was really over my no buy and no shopping thanks to quarantine. I signed back up for Ipsy thinking I was getting a May bag but I guess it was sold out. When the June spoilers came out, I decided to do plus for the month but I couldn't find how to do it on the site. Emailed CS and the said I could switch but couldn't get both - so if I switched to plus it would cancel out the regular glam bag. I've been pretty excited for my plus but just looked and it looks like I have a regular on its way too. Just based on the Ipsy app. This is a glam bag In addition to plus not instead of it. That I didn't make a choice for and got told was cancelled. I haven't looked to see how I got charged. Can someone tell me if I have two on the way and if so If it's possible to cancel the regular?"
none,"I have (had) an employee who had previously been working for me for many years. My son is disabled and he gets a waiver from Medicaid that creates a budget from which I can pay employees to watch him or work with him. The payroll side is overseen by a third party fiscal management company who handles the taxes, payroll, etc however, I am still technically the employer. She lost her car in January to repossession and hasn't worked since. She just started back with a borrowed car. However, she would have been furloughed during quarantine if she were in fact working at that point. What are my responsibilities and obligations here? If she's owed something for unemployment, how can I help her get it? This is a long term dedicated employee who got in a bad situation so I want to do my best by her but don't want to lie or do anything illegal."
none,"Is it normal when first taking naltrexone, for it to make you feel more normal, or more like yourself, even when drinking? Is that part of the process? To feel clarity when you should actually just be slurry and drunk?"
none,I haven't had an Ipsy sub since long ago (way before the plus and Ultimate choices). I was a little surprised that I signed up may 3 but my first bag won't be til June. I have a few questions. Is there a way to change your membership between levels (such as from glam bag to plus) if you do it by a certain date of the month? Do you normally tweak your profile based on spoilers? Like if there's a shadow palette coming up I don't like and I change the eyeshadow category to rarely” does that help? What is the normal timing of spoilers versus when you have to change it by? I had mixed results with my bags before but I also didn't work very hard at changing up my profile. Hoping for some tips to get better results this time!
none,"This kit came up today and contains the Balm In the Balm of your Hand Volume 2, along with 8 other products. The box is $34.99 and the palette retailed for $32 (on sale right now for $16). I have this palette and like it a lot! It's a good go-to palette for everyday looks and also if you travel and want eyeshadow, blush, highlight all in one palette. I use mine at least 4-5 times a week. I would buy this for a backup but I almost never pan a palette! The other stuff looks like decent basics - thrive mascara, mellow liner, Farah brush set, Ciate primer, Ofra blush, Smashbox lipstick, buxom gloss, and Milani setting spray. It seems like it would be a great kit and great price for someone whose just getting into makeup and needs the basics."
none,"I wasn't sure if links to sales are allowed. There's a link on My Subscription Addiction's home page. For $60 this box is a good deal. I got it a while back and I have really enjoyed the Erno Lazlo toner and Diff sunnies. The purse is vegan leather, which I know some people don't like,  but it appears very well made. I haven't used it so not sure how well it holds up but I have loved everything else!"
none,"My nex is constantly turning around to stare at hot younger girls, saying how this one or that one wanted to date him, how he saw some hot chick with a dog while he was running. I have started coming home from my walks with stories - hot young dad with no shirt running with double stroller, hot dude doing TRX on the playground, etc. Is it bad to use their own tactics?"
none,I got multiple texts confirming a hair appointment. Arrived today to a sign that the retail was open but no salon services will be performed til further notice. If they can send a confirmation text why can't they send one canceling the service or a notice that the salon part had closed?
none,"Does it give anyone here anxiety, agitation, food aversion, or insomnia? I'm having a little bit of all, hoping it will level out soon. I'm also having added anxiety as everyone is with corona scare and 2 kids in medical field, so maybe it's that."
none,"Hi Everyone, Today is going to be my first day on NAL.  I went through MDProactive this morning, as someone on this page recommended, and the prescription is already waiting.  I have not been able to get far with any local doctor to get a prescription and have been struggling for a while, so I am very grateful to have found this place.  The prescription is for 28 pills and I was told to take 1/2 for the first 4 days an hour before drinking and then 1 per day, so the prescription covers 30 days.  I am supposed to follow up within 2-4 weeks.  My question is, do most people stay on the prescription long term?  Is there a certain threshold that indicates whether to continue or stop after the initial month?  I appreciate any feedback."
none,"I have a condition called profound anemia and had success with IV iron infusions to treat it. My insurance paid for the first few and then I got a different policy and it was going to be several thousand dollars for two remaining IVs. I told them no” since it wasn't life or death and walked away. A few weeks later they called me on the phone and presented a patient assistance” offer from the drug company for $400 per infusion (2 were needed). I agreed to $800 total and assumed there would be some additional office visit fee. So after the second IV I got a bill for over $1600 - kind of double what was expected based on the call. Are doctors offices allowed to call and present a price for a procedure and lie, like a bait and switch? Am I liable for double what I agreed to? There was no contract or anything in writing? Edited to say: Georgia"
none,"I started dating a woman a number of months ago. During our first month of dating and getting to know each other we griped about our ex's. Her ex I guess was a diagnosed narc, in describing mine she says mine also was probably a narc and might be the reason I have some tendencies such as apologizing all the time.Fast forward a few months and especially tonight. If I dont do exactly what she wants or I tell her something she doesnt want to hear (non relationship related) she goes off. Tonight she wanted me to come over just for sex after the kids are asleep and then leave. I'm tired and dont feel like driving across the city for a quicky in the middle of the night so I say let's just wait till the weekend. This upsets her and now she says just cancel everything this weekend if I cant come by and that I'm playing games.Thoughts?"

I see many posts about some jacked up families. It seems these would be PIMH (hypocrite) They dont know why they believe what they believe, tend to follow blindly and brow beat, control or manipulate others around them. These are not the ""nice"" friends that most feel for. These are the originators of horror stories."
none,I'm new here so sorry if this has been posted before.This time of year when there's a ton of pollen in the air. I let me starter and doughs do their work outside uncovered. I'm no scientist but my goal is to capture the pollen in the dough. When consumed it acts as a sort of allergy vaccine/inoculation. Since I've been doing this my allergy symptoms have been greatly reduced and some years nonexistent.
none,Anyone know of hunting feists bred in the upper great lakes region?

none,I don't know if you would consider us proper homesteaders. We just have a large urban double lot. We have 4 apple trees (each different varieties) and a pear tree. Would this be sufficient for a family of 4? I know there are variables but I'm just looking for average or what others are doing.  I'm thinking of planting more but dont want an over abundance.
none,I don't think it's as bad now as it was in the 90s and early '00s because of the internet. What are some of the stories that were given that you now realize are fake or extremely improbable?

none,Took a half dozen geese last November just before deer season. I didnt want to take up freezer space so I put them in a larger cooler with salt and enough water to cover.Just opened this morning for the first time. No smell what so ever. I soaked one in clean water to draw some of the salt out and am smoking it now. I plan on then vacuum sealing the breasts and quarters coated in rough ground pepper and some coriander.

none,I'm admittedly bored...When shooting and sighting in your Mosin should you have the bayonet?I've read that they were designed to always have the bayonet attached and shot accordingly.
none,I'm a bit of a Russophile. I havent shot a Mosin in about 10 years. Really appreciated the history of it. My buddy at the time offered it to me for free. I turned it down because I thought it was too expensive of a gift. Didnt know how cheap they were at the time.This morning I'm picking one up. The guy is asking $280. Has sling and bayonet. Stock doesnt look terrible. Anything I should really look for in the barbell and or receiver?
none,Growing up in the world with a fairly rough side of the family I am so tired of all the dysfunctional families in JW. I believe in the Bible but its telling that JW's don't have the peace it talks about. Instead most marriages (including mine) and the resulting children are jacked. I rarely see anyone actually apply what the Bible teaches and apply it appropriately. Oh....and I grew up with a white supremacist that went to federal prison.....but have seen more actual racism in JW's.
none,"Jehovah's Witnesses two witness rule is much maligned. Because of the two witness rule (De 19:15) perpetrators have gone unpunished, victims have been left broken and disenfranchised. But what if the allegation is false and is then weaponized putting innocent people in the crosshairs of their rivals? You end up with a 21st century version of the Salem Witch hysteria. Elders are not trained investigators. At most they are considered ""spiritual shepherds"". Their sole job is to try to determine repentance and if you can remain in their ""club"". Its a scary thought that *windowwasher Bill* and *plumber Mike* and *school bus diver Gus* will decide the fate of your activity in a club based on one statement without any additional evidence. If someone is being abused get the professionals involved. The ones that have been trained for years and have the experience. Who cares about membership in a club? If an act is criminal go to the cops, go to the hospital. Let these professionals do their job. After their job is done and they have collected evidence and charges are pressed and theirs a conviction then let the elders do their thing. Your first step is not to go to the elders, its to go to the authorities! Elders first step if someone comes to them  should be to direct that person and support that person in going to the authorities. If you really press for a judicial committee to be formed on nothing more than a statement that can't be substantiated you're setting yourself up or your loved one for disappointed. Predators need to be more than removed from a congregation...they need to be removed from society....call the cops...put them in jail. Even with that....remember....its a court system...not a justice system."

none,"He began associating with Charles Taze Russell's Bible Students group about 1910. In 1935 Moyle, his wife and son left their home in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin and moved into the Brooklyn, New York headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to serve as its legal counsel, heading its newly formed Legal Department.July 21, 1939, Moyle wrote an open letter of resignation to Rutherford, protesting over conditions at ""Bethel"", the Watch Tower Society's Brooklyn headquarters, including what he described as ill treatment of workers, discrimination by Rutherford, the use and encouragement of ""filthy and vulgar language"" and a ""glorification"" of alcohol. Moyle said that Rutherford had ""many many homes, to wit, Bethel, Staten Island, California"" and deplored ""the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and your personal attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren"".Moyle had been handling the famous Minersville School District v. Gobitis case, and had won at the trial court level as well as at the appellate level. However, after Moyle's removal from the case, the Minersville School District appealed the Gobitis case to the Supreme Court. Rutherford himself argued the case before the Supreme Court in 1940, and the Court ruled against Jehovah's Witnesses by a vote of 8-1. This ruling triggered a nationwide wave of violence against Jehovah's Witnesses that lasted for the next several months. Three years later the Supreme Court overruled this decision in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943), argued by Moyle's successor, Hayden Covington.Libel lawsuitAlthough Moyle had advised his resignation would take effect on September 1, the Watch Tower board dismissed him immediately and he returned to his home congregation in Wisconsin. On October 15, 1939 the directors responded in the pages of The Watchtower, stating that ""every paragraph of that letter is false, filled with lies, and is a wicked slander and a libel"". The article compared his actions with those of Judas Iscariot."

none,"It has always amazed me that they dont do background checks when a guy is appointed. They simply ask you if there's anything that would prevent you from accepting the responsibility. A pedo or fraudster of course says ""no"". They're not terribly expensive and would help give people piece of mind. No other place would place people in such sensitive. situations without a background check and also have them do them every 4 years."

Reminds me of the 80/90s when the NFL had some much needed competition.Not quite sure why they chose cities that are already in the NFL market.

I know of many elders including some in my own family that continue to have regular association with their DF'd kids, faded kids and one even with an apostate son. Just shows how serious they are about their own rules.(btw....the one that talks to his apostate son would foam at the mouth if someone had a beard)"

none,Just found this group.My grandma (deceased) grew up a Mormon in Tooele but left when she married my grandpa and moved to WI. Anywho....a few years ago our family came across the Ohana Adventure vlog. Its a wholesome silly family friendly vlog. Eventually I realized that theyre LDS and would incorporate some of their activities into their vlog.Havent watched in a few years after they moved and ditched their dog.My question is: Is this family indicative of the average LDS family?
none,So what are you degenerate heathens doing for the Super Bowl?
none,"One thing I havent had a problem with as much as others here is shunning. I did not grow up a JW. Most of my family are atheist or agnostic. However we did have standards. If you continued to screw up as an adult and potentially influence other family you were effectively shunned. When my father left my mother, my paternal grandfather didn't talk to my father for a few years. Even after they began talking again my grandfather never looked at my father the same again. This helped me to understand the gravity of marriage and loyalty. My mothers sister (my aunt) has been wild since she was a teen. My grandparents would help her time and time again. Finally....they were through. Everyone cut off communication with her and let her live her life. She was damaging the family. My grandparents are long dead but we still hope she starts to act right but she will need to do it on her own.Her daughter (my cousin) emancipated herself when she was 15 and has been successful ever since. However.....in order to be shunned by my family you really have to royally screw up and demonstrate that you're not planning on correcting yourself. Its more than a 1 time screw up like many JC's are."

She's had the opportunity to sit in on some pretty high level executive (mostly women) decision meetings. After that my mother in law went on a rant that you cant trust people, its not smart, they'll molest her...on and on....just to put a negative spin on it. Well this Friday she starts a program at the local university. It runs 12 weeks. I'm more excited to give her additional exposure careers and learning paths. My mother in law (who I really do adore) doesnt know yet. Kind of looking forward to the crazy conversations that will happen once she finds out."
none,An elder friend of mine that has a son that was PIMO but at the time no one knew. The son lived on the other coast so the way they would bond is by sharing funny YouTube videos.Eventually he found those Super Pioneer videos. It tickled the elder to death. After book study he would have select ones gather around and laugh at these. Eventually he found out it wasnt Bethelites having fun but apostates. And more and morr apostate videos would show up in his suggestions. Not too many are still in that was in the service group.

none,"Contrary to how most feel both in and out of the org, I feel cliques are good. Cliques are the natural group formations that humans form based on various similarities.Many complain about fake friends and at the same time complain about cliques. To me personally that idea is contradictory. Fake friends are those that pretend to be friends even though you have little to no mutual interests, desires or goals. Cliques to me seem to be more sincere. Might not be the post popular idea but its what I see. If you haven't found your clique yet....keep looking. Heck...even this subreddit is a glorified version of a click and within it subcliques.Hope everyone has a great and successful day! 😀"

none,"I didnt grow up as a JW. I was baptized in my 20s. Tattoos, smoking, drugs, sex, working OT never really were that big of a deal. Sure Ive done them all but it wasn't that big of a deal. Never understood why some who leave seem to go off the deep end.This might be a good post for other. Learn from others mistakes.What are some of the things you did when you left for the sole sake of doing them that you no regret or are embarrassed?"
none,I began studying in early 2003. Not too long after a childhood friend's mother passed away that was a long time witness and I was able to get her bond volumes going back to the late 50s. I really enjoyed reading the older and current WT and Awakes. Most of the articles I thought were interesting and decently researched. And yes....I saw that they were mostly written to support another idea. Even with that there were articles of general interest that didnt have really anytbing to do with doctrine. 2 WT at 32 pages and 2 Awakes at 32 pages gave me 128 pages of information monthly. Then the chopping came and now down to a 16 page mag every other month and a monthly 32 page study edition for only 40 pages monthly. Of those 40 pages the articles are much less thorough or robust or interesting. Even the study articles dont seem as founded as before. Was there some turnover in the writing department about 10 years ago or something?
none,"I went to two consultations today, the first one I definitely wasn't feeling, the second one I left with a really good feeling. I have another consultation on Thursday and one on Friday. Just curious how many others went through before settling on their therapists. I don't want to immediately choose this one I liked, but the consultation fees are rough when coming out of pocket."

none,"Honestly, I was just feeling lazy, and since I had them done for me last year I figured I'd do the same this year. Then I remembered I'm not working, I got bills, and 140 bucks is a lot of money for something I can do for free. So I took a couple hours out my day, spilled my coffee; and did my taxes. I feel productive. Let me have this."
none,"Whenever we went out to eat, as soon as my food came, my ex would immediately try to get some of my food. Most of the time she wouldn't even ask. I remember once right after I ordered she said I'm getting some of that”. At first it was cute, but when I realized it happened literally every single time we went out, even after she knew it irritated me, it hit me that this was all about power. It's something so small, something you think is just a quirk of their personality that you don't give it a second thought in the beginning. Only for the truth to broadside your years later."
none,"We were together ten years. This is our first birthday apart. I lived for her birthday. I looked forward to it more than most holidays. To be here and not send her a long note for her birthday is so so hard. I've been debating breaking no contact, being filled with anxiety for the last week. When I realized the other day that being anxiety filled was the exact way I used to always feel around her on a normal day, I told myself I can't break no contact, for my own sake. It's hard, but at the end of the day, when I go to bed tonight, I can hopefully look back at today as another milestone in my healing. Just venting."
none,"A literal weight lifted from my shoulders watching those oaths be taken. Humanity, competence, adults, science, truth, are all back in control of America. It's a good day."
none,"Bring on the hate, but Salem's Lot didn't do it for me, granted I've never been the biggest fan of the vampire genre. So when I started reading Night Shift last week and was engrossed by both these stories (granted JL isn't a vampire story) I was pretty surprised. One For the Road especially. Damn, that's such a great, creepy story. Actually made me want to go back and give Salem's Lot another try."
none,Toy soldiers exacting revenge...honestly didn't see that coming from King. Great story.
none,"I've spend  almost a couple years of healing and being single, enjoying my life and finding myself again. It's been very refreshing to become independent and improve myself in many ways. Like many of us on here I've done my fair share of learning about the abuse and identifying all the red flags. A month ago I met someone on a dating app and it's so refreshing to meet someone who seems normal. She complements me randomly, does many cute things that keep me on my toes, and is very.. nice. It is such a shock to me that everything is so calm and goes the way it should.  I'm still expecting for her to randomly get mad at me or start calling me names, stonewalling, making me feel bad about myself and the list goes on and on just like I've been used to. But she doesn't. Every single day gets better and better and it brings me to tears. Only this time happy ones. She knows small pieces about the abuse I've experienced and is fully excepting and willing to help me get thru the rare triggers I still have and is determined to get past the huge wall I have that I think will never come down. She makes me happy and feel better about myself. She won't let me beat myself up, and lifts me higher. I don't have to overthink or doubt anything when it comes to her. I am completely content in my own mind. It's only been a month and I am still on high alert but it is so refreshing. I still have a hard time feeling anything at all in general, not just romantic stuff so I still have work to process through with myself and she only makes it easier."

none,"I've been trying to motivate myself to start working out for a while. I've always struggled to gain weight. I'm fairly skinny, and don't have much muscle and I'm looking to bulk up and gain muscle. It's a bit overwhelming with all the options online especially not knowing terminology and about machines. I'm looking to hit the gym and honestly I don't mind going all in and doing what it takes. Not looking to be completely ripped but I want to gain weight and have a solid form."

I don't have any interest really in getting to know anyone and it feels meh. And then I just block them a day later cuz im tired and bored of talking and feel bothered. Anyone else relate? I feel lonely at the same time and want to get back into it but I always gravitate to wanting to keep doing my thing solo. Also I feel like I'll never tear this wall down. I've always been so open before, but I know when I get back into the talking stage old memories, insecurities, worries, jealousy, will flood back in from my nex and I'll get triggered which hasn't happened in forever.

none,"First of all let me say I don't think my nex knew where I worked before today. At least not to my knowledge I'm in a very good place. I'm at a point where my nex is not even on my radar anymore. This Christmas is gonna be different, I won't be in tears and unexplainable pain.  I was at work today just like any normal day. Didn't even have it on my mind and all of a sudden this customer asks me a question. I turn and realize it's my nexs mom. I immediately get an adrenaline rush and my heart is pounding out of my chest. She probably thought I've seen a ghost.  (My name) Is that you” she says to me. I passed her along to a coworker because I wasn't sure if a trigger would start. She eventually disappeared and later when I spotted her at checkout, there she was, My nex. She never noticed me probably because her mom told her and she has this thing where she can't do anything embarrassing  in front of her mom.  Thankfully my Nex never made direct contact with me. I know I would've had the strength to tell her to fuck off tho.  I was in my head for the next hour thinking about what I may have said to her and had an intrusive thought of blowing up on her and her mom and saying all the nasty shit she's done to me and about me being in therapy for the last 9 months cause of her.  I eventually went on break and treated myself. What I do to calm down or stop getting in my head. All is well. I know tomorrow is gonna feel amazing and I'll truly be able to enjoy Christmas this year. Merry Christmas to you all."
none,"I've boosted a couple times and I've gotten plenty of likes, 10 or so according to the notifications from the app. And when I go to check them none of the are there. I've even got emails that I received a match and message yet it doesn't show up. Anyone know what's going on? Is this related to a ban?  Makes boosting pointless because I don't see the likes. Also should mention sometimes the invisible likes do appear in the feed since I matched a like I couldn't see."
none,"My nex stonewalled me and gave me the silent treatment plenty of times. She mostly did this whenever she upset me as a leverage to make me even more upset and wouldnt answer for days.  But of course near the end of the relationship whenever I asked for space she couldn't resist and would start texting me Random tiktoks, memes, or just nonsense pictures  not even relating to what she did to warrant me needing space. Almost like she was checking in to make sure she still knew my every move"
none,"I put the flair to try to prevent this from triggering anyone if in case it's  deemed too sensitive because I know it was for meI don't really get this feeling anymore but whenever something I saw,heard, thought about the abuse or whenever I had indirect contact with my nex, you almost feel like you  you leave your body and you're completely in your feelings, or the lack of them, and not even aware of your surroundings. You're completely gone”. This is something I have worked on in therapy and was one of my bigger issues to work through.  I have figured out and processed that this is  most likely due to all the trauma that has been inflicted."
none,"You have to remind yourself that this isn't a normal person. I think we all never expected that there are such cruel people capable of crippling the genuine kind hearted people in this world. You did everything you could. You gave it your all. It is not okay to be treated like shit. To be gaslighted, and to be blamed, told that you don't matter, have your feelings invalidated and shutdown, to feel like your going crazy in your head. You're not crazy. You do matter.  Kindness and compassion are not something we should beg for.  You're so brave and strong for being able to get through this. You're trying so hard and I promise you it gets better. It may not happen right away I promise one day  you'll be in such a better place. Sometimes in such a situation where everything is broken it may not seem like it, but that's what I said too and I'm in such a better place and I know you will be too.  You deserve to be happy, You are worth everything, and a person that truly understands you're worth and treats you right will be NOTHING like what you've been put through.   So when you're in those moments where you start missing them, or start having thought just remind yourself of everything you have been through and all the work you have done since leaving. Keep pushing forward.  I am so proud of you.  We are here for you."
none,"Back story, I was in a relationship with my nex for 5 months, been no contact for 10 months. Despite the fact that her life was a secret from me, so was her guy best friend who turned out (of course) to be her new supply? Or perhaps he was better than me.   Towards the end of our relationship their contact grew exponentially  as she would stonewall me and not talk to me for days upon end until I found out she hung out” with him very frequently behind my back. Lied about it. It was very obvious that she was with him and id been cheated on especially cause I have so much suspicion plus he's the one that told her to break up with me. Anyway, coincidentally I have a friend and he is friends with my nexs brother so even though she's been out of my life there's still that connection. My friend and my nex are practically strangers to each other.  I've specifically told my friend to never mention or say a word or doings of my nex. Tonight I was talking to my friend told me he saw the cheaters car outside nexs house. I stopped him right there but it was too late as my feelings took me back and I felt that horrible sad feeling that brings me back to all the meltdowns. All the abuse. Etc.   He apologized it slipped and he wasn't thinking and I know it was an accident. But it just sucks. I'm almost a year no contact with my nex and I've worked so hard thru therapy and self validation, things like this subreddit have helped so much. But little things like this information still trigger and it just sucks.  Why does this still happen?"
none,"Has anyone found that when you meet a person and they are incredibly nice” to you, you get sad  almost makes you wanna cry and it kind of makes you want to stay away from that person?  In my case whenever I meet a girl that I get attracted to it makes me doubt the authenticity of this person immediately. And by incredibly nice” I mean you take normal behavior and human decency as an extreme gratitude"
none,"Frequent lurker here,Little back story, I was trapped in a relationship for 5 months until she cheated on me and broke up with me.  I've been no contact with her since early February and been in therapy since March.  All these posts on here really helped me and this subreddit really helped me understand what was happening to me and was the beginning of my escape and recovery.  Almost every post of peoples descriptions of their nex  fits my nex's character.  The first few months were awful as I tried to undo all the abuse and things she planted in my mind about myself.  5 months no contact, I can finally live without thinking about her every day. I'm still in a rough place tho as my therapist told me I need to talk about examples or things my nex did to me in order to fully let go. ( don't know if that will help) which is incredibly hard to do because I can't remember anything.   Just the way she made me feel. Anyway, she texted me tonight saying  hi a song came on that reminded me of you so I decided to text you  I hope  you're doing ok and that you're happy❤️”I'm struggling so hard because I forgot I unblocked her to see if she'd ever text me and I forgot about that.  I want so badly to tell her I'm not okay, I've been in therapy for the last five months and let her know why she did to me."
none,"First time I'm finally feeling like I can somehat journal because the pain has been so bad I can't even think it. I don't wanna go back to that memory. Because of you I judge myself. I question everything I do wondering if I'm ever good enough.   I constantly believe I'm not worthy of love and no one will ever want me.      It is now a little over 3 months since our breakup. Tomorrow marks 2 months of no contact.  Since then I have been trying to pick myself back up. Doing everything I can. I'm used to pain but nothing like you caused me. It's crippled me farther then I thought possible.   I have had many down swings in sadness. Each day is different and could be worse.  A month ago was the worst mental state I have ever been in. I can't even begin to describe the pain I was in that day. Nothing I did could get rid of the excruciating pain I felt inside.   I wanted it to go away so bad.   I gave you everything. Absolutely everything. Treated you with respect and kindness, and gave you all my love.   I treasured you more than anything in my life. You became my only source of happiness, yet you inflicted so much pain onto me constantly.  What more did I have to give? I used to think I was the one that was wrong. I know I treated you right. But you have skewed my mind. Because of you I don't want to let go. I can't take compliments or support. When people are nice to me it feels wrong and weird.  You trained me to believe your degrading words is what I deserved. That I deserved to be treated so horribly when I gave you everything. I'm afraid to love. I'm afraid to  let up even a bit. Everything I do now I have this huge wall up. I don't know if I will ever be able to love someone as much as I did you. Because now I see loving someone as much as I did associated with getting emotionally abused. There's many days I sit and wonder what you are up to. What you are doing, if you are thinking about me? Do I cross your mind? Anything? Because of your trauma bond you created I have this longing for more even tho you trapped, abused, and used me as your punching bag.   I KNOW I can never go back!!!  You make me believe that I'll never find someone as good” as you. Someone as pretty”. Let me tell you, you are very very ugly. The ugliest person I know."
none,"I(21M) was in a very emotionally abusive relationship  with my(18)F Ex. It took so long to cut her out of my life.  Right now I am struggling very hard to go through life normally.  I haven't had contact with her for a few weeks now. I don't think I miss her, in fact I want nothing to do with her.   I'm very hurt still over all the pain she caused to the point where I can't even talk about it. Here is a list i made  a while ago with some of the stuff she's done to me ( this is just the brink of what she's done)  but  how I feel is so damaging. This is the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life. It is so hard to get through everyday. I just have a huge cloud of sadness every second.   I am looking for advice on how to get better and cope. Tried to talk to her about her day her friends etc. and she wouldn't tell me anything Continuously tried to ask her about her day and things going on.   she wouldn't let me see her Instagram over the entire course of her relationship with you made me feel like she was hiding something or cheating on me. Never let me meet any of her friends. ( worthless, doesn't want me a part of her life) Has hundreds of nudes of her self on her phone which makes me feel like she sells them online or she sending them to people. Wouldn't show or send any of those nudes to me.  Everything is always sketchyWhenever we were together she was always texting other guys she wouldn't text me back sometimes until 4 to 5 hours later and that was very common for every response ( unworthy, boring)She will always get excited to see you guys at work never excited to see me. Always would have to hear about how she's always flirting with the guys at work never does that with meAlways have to hear about guys touching her at work and she doesn't do anything to stop itAsked her to not hang out with somebody that liked her and then she made me feel guilty about itMade me feel like everything was always my fault when I never did anything wrongI gave her everything she ever wanted to gave me nothingWhenever I came to see her at work she would get ashamed or get mad at me and then text me later that I ruined it and I put her in a really bad mood. Didn't really talk about me much that anyone kept us a secret. Didn't seem proud that I was hers she never bragged about me or both or about me to anyone. Talked bad about me to her parents and her friends and never fixed it. Wanted me to lie to her parents and make her seem like he was perfect and it was all my fault. Made me feel really bad all the time. Made me believe that I really was pushing severely to get her to have sex with me. Made me melt down in my room countless amount of times if I had to put a number on it I probably spent 2 weeks total being sad over her . I have never shed so many tears in my life but because of her.  never supported me on things and even made fun of me when I was upset. Laughs at me when I cry. Doesn't want to talk through things in the  and immediately dips out after she says what she wants to say . always would do things like give her rides whenever she asked her do her favors or go out of my way to drive back to her house after I drove home because she was scared and she never could do a single thing for me ever. Never was willing to compromise on anything and is told me countless amount of times she will never change anything about her. Never genuinely meant any apology. I still to this day spent countless hours hoping that one day things are gonna get better and the bottom line is they will never change. Never took into consideration how I felt about anything did things anyway even though I didn't like themDidn't care how I felt about anythingEverything always had to be her way. Told me she didn't give a fuck about me or my feelings. Has made it clear that she doesn't give a fuck how much she breaks me down.Hangs up on me countless amount of times over phone calls when this is something that needs to be talked about. Makes me so sad and doesn't even care and just leaves me there. Continuously gives me a little bit of hope that she actually cares and that she sorry goes back to the same way she's been. Makes me feel guilty for getting mad or angry when she makes me the sad and depressed. Tells me I have no right to be angry over what she's done to me. When we're in my room and she gets mad at me sugar on her phone for two hours and not even talk to me. Shamed me for the way things are and doesn't want anything to do with anything and how to fix it. Tells me that I'm talking bad about her when all I'm doing is telling people the truth of how she's talking to me. Nicotine has been made the only thing that is a stress reliever when it comes to her and it doesn't even always work.  she has made me feel so worthless and like I'm not good enough she's made me feel like I'm not shit and I never was. Constantly talks flirts and does stuff with other guys and does none of it with me. I've given her everything and she makes me feel like I've given her nothing. She makes me feel like I'm in a bad person and she tells me and makes me feel like I am at fault for everything when I'm not. Her manipulative behavior has trapped me because I am a good person and all I want is to love her and be with her. Made me scared to talk to her about anything because as soon as I did she would go off on me and make it my fault. Made me scared to do a lot of things. Always never knowing what was gonna happen with anything. Always not knowing if tomorrow we were going to break up. Kept her life hidden from me the whole time. Every time I would ask a question to bring something up she would turn around and make me the crazy one.  i've spent so much time thinking about how much I love her and wanting things to work and every time I hang out with her I'm like OK this is never going to happen. I don't understand why things are so complicated and it shouldn't be because the person I am and everything that I do I should be in the perfect position. I never deserved any of this. I truly never did anything even though she makes it seem like I did. Went away to Texas for 10 days and she barely text me or talk to me at all. She probably hung out with other guys and do whatever she did while I was gone anyway. I was on vacation I was supposed to be having a good time but I was always worried about her and what she was doing. Halfway through the vacation she texted me and talk to me less and it was becoming more and more clear that something was going on.  December 23 I called her and found out that something was up and she told me she was losing feelings for me I couldn't sleep at all that nightDecember 24 I finally came home and she told me she had no feelings for me told me that she didn't know she did it all which meant it was fake and everything I knew was a lie. Cried more than I did my entire life. Woke up the next morning feeling so empty and genuinely wanting to kill myself. Felt so sad and empty for days straight and she didn't give a damn at all I would text her and she told me she didn't care. She was physically sick because of her coincidental flu. She didn't care at all about what happened. She continue to go throughout life actually happy as can be very happy and told me that. Make me the crazy one when I explained what she did to me telling me she never did anything wrong telling me the horrible person I am. I finally got the courage to block her and after a few days   texted me that she wanted me to unblock her so she could talk and that screwed me up and I caved. She gave a very short not caring apology and of course I got suckered into it. Kept telling me we could only be friends even though I still loved her and it was not fair to me.  even though she only want to be friends she would do stuff like lean on me and touch me. We are in a fight drove home and she blocked me. One week later she wrote this big apology that she sent to guilt which got to me and I felt guilty for her being upset and I caved again. The next day after the big apology she then proceeds to call me out and say it was very uncalled for for me to get angry at her. To this point I still was talking to her before I just blocked her.  She trashed my reputation of people at Jewel. and now they hate me and don't look at me the same. Trashed my reputation to  s momI love her and there's no possible way for me to be friends and I keep telling that and she makes it clear that she only wants to do what she wants to do and it doesn't matter about me. Continues to give me hope even tho it's never gonna happen. Wouldn't give me attention or make an effort to see me after I was in the hospital Countless times she's made it evident that she cares about this guy friend she has, rather then me. She more than likely cheated on me with him. She lied to me saying she was studying and ditched me to hang out with him. Tells me I'm being very mean when I'm only telling her what she did to me ( no bad language, normal words)Wouldn't respond to me for hours on end, sometimes 4-8 hrs whenever she hurt me and I was trying to tell her. I gave her everything. Everything I had. I am so emotionally drained.  I don't think I'll ever be able to trust anyone again"

Everything is always sketchyWhenever we were together she was always texting other guys she wouldn't text me back sometimes until 4 to 5 hours later and that was very common for every response ( unworthy, boring)She will always get excited to see you guys at work never excited to see me. Always would have to hear about how she's always flirting with the guys at work never does that with meAlways have to hear about guys touching her at work and she doesn't do anything to stop itAsked her to not hang out with somebody that liked her and then she made me feel guilty about itMade me feel like everything was always my fault when I never did anything wrongI gave her everything she ever wanted to gave me nothingWhenever I came to see her at work she would get ashamed or get mad at me and then text me later that I ruined it and I put her in a really bad mood. Didn't really talk about me much that anyone kept us a secret. Didn't seem proud that I was hers she never bragged about me or both or about me to anyone. Talked bad about me to her parents and her friends and never fixed it. Wanted me to lie to her parents and make her seem like he was perfect and it was all my fault. Made me feel really bad all the time. Made me believe that I really was pushing severely to get her to have sex with me. Made me melt down in my room countless amount of times if I had to put a number on it I probably spent 2 weeks total being sad over her . I have never shed so many tears in my life but because of her.  never supported me on things and even made fun of me when I was upset. Laughs at me when I cry. Doesn't want to talk through things in the  and immediately dips out after she says what she wants to say . always would do things like give her rides whenever she asked her do her favors or go out of my way to drive back to her house after I drove home because she was scared and she never could do a single thing for me ever. Never was willing to compromise on anything and is told me countless amount of times she will never change anything about her. Never genuinely meant any apology. I still to this day spent countless hours hoping that one day things are gonna get better and the bottom line is they will never change. Never took into consideration how I felt about anything did things anyway even though I didn't like themDidn't care how I felt about anythingEverything always had to be her way. Told me she didn't give a fuck about me or my feelings. Has made it clear that she doesn't give a fuck how much she breaks me down.Hangs up on me countless amount of times over phone calls when this is something that needs to be talked about. Makes me so sad and doesn't even care and just leaves me there. Continuously gives me a little bit of hope that she actually cares and that she sorry goes back to the same way she's been. Makes me feel guilty for getting mad or angry when she makes me the sad and depressed. Tells me I have no right to be angry over what she's done to me. When we're in my room and she gets mad at me sugar on her phone for two hours and not even talk to me. Shamed me for the way things are and doesn't want anything to do with anything and how to fix it. Tells me that I'm talking bad about her when all I'm doing is telling people the truth of how she's talking to me. Nicotine has been made the only thing that is a stress reliever when it comes to her and it doesn't even always work.  she has made me feel so worthless and like I'm not good enough she's made me feel like I'm not shit and I never was. Constantly talks flirts and does stuff with other guys and does none of it with me. I've given her everything and she makes me feel like I've given her nothing. She makes me feel like I'm in a bad person and she tells me and makes me feel like I am at fault for everything when I'm not. Her manipulative behavior has trapped me because I am a good person and all I want is to love her and be with her. Made me scared to talk to her about anything because as soon as I did she would go off on me and make it my fault. Made me scared to do a lot of things. Always never knowing what was gonna happen with anything. Always not knowing if tomorrow we were going to break up. Kept her life hidden from me the whole time. Every time I would ask a question to bring something up she would turn around and make me the crazy one.  i've spent so much time thinking about how much I love her and wanting things to work and every time I hang out with her I'm like OK this is never going to happen. I don't understand why things are so complicated and it shouldn't be because the person I am and everything that I do I should be in the perfect position. I never deserved any of this. I truly never did anything even though she makes it seem like I did. Went away to Texas for 10 days and she barely text me or talk to me at all. She probably hung out with other guys and do whatever she did while I was gone anyway. I was on vacation I was supposed to be having a good time but I was always worried about her and what she was doing. Halfway through the vacation she texted me and talk to me less and it was becoming more and more clear that something was going on.  December 23 I called her and found out that something was up and she told me she was losing feelings for me I couldn't sleep at all that nightDecember 24 I finally came home and she told me she had no feelings for me told me that she didn't know she did it all which meant it was fake and everything I knew was a lie. Cried more than I did my entire life. Woke up the next morning feeling so empty and genuinely wanting to kill myself. Felt so sad and empty for days straight and she didn't give a damn at all I would text her and she told me she didn't care. She was physically sick because of her coincidental flu. She didn't care at all about what happened. She continue to go throughout life actually happy as can be very happy and told me that. Make me the crazy one when I explained what she did to me telling me she never did anything wrong telling me the horrible person I am. I finally got the courage to block her and after a few days Kayla texted me that she wanted me to unblock her so she could talk and that screwed me up and I caved. She gave a very short not caring apology and of course I got suckered into it. Kept telling me we could only be friends even though I still loved her and it was not fair to me.  even though she only want to be friends she would do stuff like lean on me and touch me. We are in a fight drove home and she blocked me. One week later she wrote this big apology that she sent to guilt which got to me and I felt guilty for her being upset and I caved again. The next day after the big apology she then proceeds to call me out and say it was very uncalled for for me to get angry at her. To this point I still was talking to her before I just blocked her.  She trashed my reputation of people at Jewel. and now they hate me and don't look at me the same. Trashed my reputation to Alyssas momI love her and there's no possible way for me to be friends and I keep telling that and she makes it clear that she only wants to do what she wants to do and it doesn't matter about me. Continues to give me hope even tho it's never gonna happen. Wouldn't give me attention or make an effort to see me after I was in the hospital Countless times she's made it evident that she cares about this guy friend she has, rather then me. She more than likely cheated on me with him. She lied to me saying she was studying and ditched me to hang out with him. Tells me I'm being very mean when I'm only telling her what she did to me ( no bad language, normal words)Wouldn't respond to me for hours on end, sometimes 4-8 hrs whenever she hurt me and I was trying to tell her. I gave her everything. Everything I had. I am so emotionally drained.  I don't think I'll ever be able to trust anyone again"
none,"I(21M) have been with my girlfriend(18)F for a little over 3 months now.  The first month of our relationship was really really good honeymoon” phase  and everything was always good and happy.   As time progresses I realized I never really got the chance to know her.  I realize I didn't even really know the kind of person she really was until I started to figure out how brutal she can be. My girlfriend does many things that keeps me secretive” including not showing me her instagram giving no reason at all, never takes pictures with me or posts  anything about us ever even when I ask, doesn't really bring me up to her friends enough, and I never know anything about her or her life because she tells me as little as possible. Whenever something upsets me she often gets really mad at me and turns it around and makes me feel bad for what I am doing.  She often ignores everything problem we may encounter and won't talk about it.  When we are together in person it's like every time I try to ask something or get to know her she gets annoyed and won't tell me and often a fight breaks out. And when we are distant (not with each other) she rarely responds to my texts, leaving them for often 4 hours without responding. It really sucks because sometimes all I want is to talk to her and she doesn't want to apparently.   The last month I have been so upset almost everyday because I hope things will change and they never do.   Every single day I have been stressed and just depressed because I have so much feelings for her and this is how she treats me. I text her, she never respond often leaving it till next day to ignore what I said and say good morning”. She never wants to try to work through our issues.  And she makes me feel like I'm not enough because I always here about all the other people including many guys she talks to and she's always so happy and bubbly with them and never with me.  Things don't happen naturally with me and her. We can't even carry a conversation most of the time, I try  but she never tries to initiate anything either, both in texting and in personThen the other night we went to dinner for our 3 month anniversary and it actually went really well in the beginning. Afterwards I asked her if we can take a picture together for the occasion. Again she said no and I just asked her why. She proceeds to once again turn it around on me and ask why we always fight and why it's like this. She then tells me she doesn't give a F*** about my feelings and that she could care less. She tells me she doesn't talk to me cause she doesn't want to. She deliberately ignores my messages while texting other people at the same time.   And that even when she knows I'm upset that she just doesn't care at all.   I dropped her off and I went home and couldn't sleep all night just breaking down. The next day she told me she was just mad.  Few hours go by and we are texting and   She does the same thing not responding for hours. I lost it saying  you just live making my life hell, and this makes you happy doesn't it”? She responded saying  yes I do, makes me so happy”. We continue to text and she gets the idea that I was about to break up with her so she apologized and said she didn't wanna lose me.  Later that night, I was at a park with my friends and she knew I was there and she came there and wanted to talk and so we did. She took blame for everything and said that she's in the wrong for everything and for the first time actually seemed like she was caring. And told me she was gonna change and I'm doing nothing wrong and asked me how she can care about me.  I made a list of things that I showed her the next day. She still told me she meant everything she said but she's trying to change it. The next day which was yesterday, she actually was showing she cared doing many things such as showing affection randomly, telling me how much she loves me, and overall many things that never were happening before. I'm stuck on what to do because everything she told me has been so damaging, scaring, and I am so hurt by everything she said because I love her, and am so caring and never would do all the horrible things she has said and done to me.    Every single day it's the only thing I can think about and I literally can't even function. It just sucks because I'm one of those ppl that fall hard really fast and I don't wanna be alone and wanna believe she will change but she never has to this point. Should I even give her one last Chance?TL;DR  My girlfriend and treated me horribly wrong telling me she doesn't care about my feelings at all, intentionally ignoring me and not wanting to talk to me and it's left me extremely hurt. Now she owns up to everything she has done and blames herself.  But should I even give her that chance?"
none,"I (21M) have been with my girlfriend(18F) for almost 3 months now.  Let me just start by saying I want to know if I'm just overreacting, maybe I just need to be patient and give it time. I know it's still very early in the relationship. From the beginning everything has been good in terms of having small talk, learning about each other.  We never really got to be friends before this we jumped right into dating, and I asked her to be my girlfriend on the second time seeing her outside of work.   The last few weeks I've really been trying to get to know about her more and trying to make it about her. I ask about her day and pretty much what's going on with her and she always gives me the vague response of  I'm good”, or everything's fine” and that's okay when she actually is. Sometimes though I can tell by her body language and how's she's acting that things aren't fine and she will never tell me what's going on, when all I want to do is be there and help her.  A lot of the times she will tell me her and her friends are arguing and that's why she's down, but she will never go into detail.   She always says that she doesn't feel like explaining everything to me because I don't know any of her friends. And that's true I don't know any of them but it's like when am I ever gonna get to hear about them or actually become in the know”.  She always tells me that talking about what's going on with her won't matter to me and that I won't care.  I've never met any of her friends and she's met almost all of mine. It's hard for me to understand why she can't talk about it. On the flip side she has no problems telling me how she feels about me and I really appreciate that. She told me that talking about things is hard for her to do and she usually doesn't talk about things with anyone.   But last night she told me that she does in fact tell people about things going on and that it is just me she doesn't tell certain things about what's going on with her It just feels like she is not accepting me to come into her life yet almost like I'm something on the side and she doesn't want me becoming a part of her. Do I just need to give it time as it's only been 3 months? Or is this an actual problem?TL;DR My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 months and she won't talk to me about things going on in her life.  I just want to be there for her to have someone to talk to and support her."

I have a few questions on this, if someone can help.**Situation**We discovered damage on the side of our van, and filed a claim stating that we are not sure how it happened, that it was possibly caused in a parking lot of a supermarket.**Investigation**They investigated the damage (calling in a third party expert as well), and concluded that it could not have been caused by another vehicle hitting the van. It could *only* be caused by one of us side swiping some stationary object, and given the extent of the damage, we would have known about this. Which means that we are lying about the fact that we don't know how it happened (hence the misrepresentation).**Questions**1. I am somewhat baffled that just because they are certain that this was not caused by another vehicle, they have concluded that it could not have been caused in any other way (other than one of us having caused it). I mean, how can they be 100% sure of this?! What if another vehicle was carrying something that hit the van?1. Do we have any recourse here? This just seems so completely capricious of the insurance company.1. Having this on our record (the misrepresentation / insurance fraud) - I am guessing that that is quite damaging.

none,"I am in Israel on a business trip, out for a walk on the beach. There are so many pretty, young girls everywhere. A breeze blows in from the ocean; red sky in the distance. It feels nice and full, but I wish I had someone next to me. I look around, but all of them are way too young, their heads full of silly dreams and quick answers. Then I spot her. She is standing by herself, gazing out at the sea, amused and baffled by strangeness of what moves us. She glances around shyly, gazes at her feet, then out to the sea again.I go and stand beside her. She notices me; a little smile, then looks away.I'm Eric” I say.Hannah”Norway?”Sweden” she smiles.It's such a pretty smile, it breaks my heart. Somehow it speaks of all the bitter sweet moments she has lived. I wonder about her. Did she wander the barren wastelands of adolescence? How many times did she love and say goodbye? What moments of delirious wild abandon, or wrenching heart ache; of wondrous amazement, and epiphanies, of seething anger? I want to know her, if she would let me.Um   I don't mean to be forward, but   I could use some company over dinner. That is, if you haven't eaten yet.”She looks at me, trying to decide if it would be worth her time. Then she smiles, and shrugs.OK, why not. I have to eat. And you seem harmless,” she laughs.Yes, yes. Mostly,” I laugh.Dinner turns out to be a very engrossing experience. The conversation initially just sputters and bounces around, trying to latch on to something meaningful, and then settles into a steady torrent that comes tumbling out of us; all the things that touch us, that for some reason we want the other person to hear. There is warm, tinkling laughter; happy silence; followed by more warm happiness. This goes on for a while. And it creeps up on us. All the talk and laughter has turned into a need. We want to be with each other, hold hands or whatever, just not have the moment end. So I invite her for a walk back to my hotel room, to sit around and talk. She hesitates, checks me over one more time to see if it might be safe, and then nods with a half-smile.I don't know how we ended up here, but she is lying in the bed, fully clothed, staring at me with her dark eyes, while I stand, taking her in, looking at her fragile, delicate face. I go up to her, and she follows me with her eyes. I sit on my knees, on top of her, one leg on each side. I hold my hand against her face. I want to feel her. I put my other hand on her face, and I peer into her eyes, I look at her lips, and every inch of her lovely face. I can't get enough of her, so I keep drinking, scanning back and forth, tracing lines around her lips, touching her nose, her ear lobes, eyes, chin; I am overwhelmed. There is so much beauty.I have tied her hands and feet to the bed, and taken her shirt and pants off. She has her bra and panties on. I start at her hip, and slide my hand up her side, against the beautiful, soft skin. I can feel her breathing quicken. My hand goes over the bump of her bra strap, the side of her chest, and I turn my hand over to brush my nails against her armpit. She moans. I feel her shoulder, her back, and feel my way down her arm, her elbow, and fingers. Her hands are small and smooth, and I linger, caressing. I retrace my steps up her arm, down her side, till my palm rests on her stomach. I explore the area around her navel, in widening circles, till my fingers slide just a little under the edge of her panties. I feel her mound with my fingertips. I press my lips on her stomach, small kisses all over. She moans, and writhes. My lips move up the side of her body, past the bump of the bra strap, into her armpit. I lick her there, slowly, and deliberately. She stiffens at the first touch, and moans. My lips slide back down to her belly, circling close to her panty line. I slide the panties down using both my hands. I kiss her on the top of her pussy, spreading it with my fingers. She opens up like a flower, and I taste her with my tongue, kissing and sucking. Her eyes are closed, face contorted in agony.I have turned her over, tied her up again. I explore her back, inch by inch, from the nape of her neck, down to the mounds of her buttocks. My hands ride the curves of her bottom, down her thighs, calves and her feet. I slide down to her feet, and kiss the beautiful arches. I lick them with my tongue, starting from the base of her toes. Her toes curl. I move up to her buttocks, kissing each cheek, slowly, my lips feeling her. I pry her buttocks apart, and trace a path with my fingertips down the crack. She shivers when I brush past her hole. I trace a circle around it with my fingers, leaning in to kiss. Then I probe her just a tiny bit with my fingertip. At this point, she comes; heaving, and crying, and writhing; quaking for ever and ever."

none,"I dont know if this is the right place to post, dont know where else to go. But we all know of the famous monk who sacrificed himself, which his picture is seen across the world.I want to know how is this possible? How did that man endure or even done that without any movement. Did he suffer? Did he feel anything?If so how is this possible? How does one learn this?Is there any book on this topic. I am just so intrigued because in parts of psychology there is a rule that we can almost never control our instincts. Presumably Carl Jung visited the zoo often and tried all the time to be close to the snake cage and everytime the snake attacked he would flinch. He tried ghis many times. Conclusion comes we cannot control these. The problem is all this mon went through is instinct. No breathing, pain, burning alive, smoke its incredible in some way and yet his instincts never gave in. How is this"

The worst part for me was when i needed help i was also unemployed and had no income. The reason for the unemployment is because of mental health to begin with. So therapy helped me get on the right track and if i didnt get the help for free i dont know what i would do since i cant pay for it, which would then put me in a vicious cycle.I salute all of you who work and pay for therapy and to those who cant afford but try and do your best, its very difficult and i want the best for all if you."

none,"I am musician who has played guitar for the last 15 years. In my journey i have studied at 2 conservatories. All my playing was always live jamming, giging and making music. I was never into pop music and always gravitated towards music from the 60s 70s mostly. Jazz has also been a part of my life in the recent 7 years. I have after some time decided to become a producer. I imagined all my knowledge would give me something back. The reason for doing music prod the last year was to try and live off music. Living and working as a guitar player is not easy but duable. Anyways to my journey into music production i have discovered how much absent i have been from modern music. I always knew what a music producer does and have been with many. The problem is the music which i played was different from the music today. I tried to get into Pop music and perhaps doing something there considering todays pop is the most profitable way of music production. What i discovered along the way for me personally was shocking, i imagined the whole process was going to be similar as to when Quincy produced Thriller or Bob Rock Metallicas Black album. But it wasnt what it has become as it seems to me is programming of sampled based music, which i have nothing against and i think many people like skrillex are amazing musicians. I also enjoy it myself. Its amazing what you can do with sound just profound to the point that its sad how dull pop music can be considering the vastness...i would love to give Jimi hendrix, Zappa or Beethoven a daw and see what they come up with. I have recently made new contacts within the pop music production and it seems to me many of them dont really understand music. Many of them dont know how to play an instrument, and all they rely on is samples which sound really good and with which way they manipulate this with. Now i consider these individuals as Electronic musicians and not Producers. You cannot be a producer and not understand the musical spectre of recording, micing sound design, notes arrangment and everything else that comes with it. I find it that the word Music producer has changed, because its not what it used to be. Times change everything changes. But you cannot tell me that someone who puts samples on a grid is a producer. And i am not bashing any daw or sampled based music, i enjoy it very much i am saying that the word producer has changed and it seems its not real producing but what it is its programing. And i wish that it would be changed to that as i feel thats more apropriate...Many of the so called producers only use a daw and have no other understanding of other aspects of music.The word producer has changed."

How is it that in capitalism there are so many people who are poor, sick, weak homeless and pennyless? Didnt they account for this? Didnt they account and know this would happen? Did they consider it? I really wonder this. How can a system that has developed so much wealth develop so much poverty? Why didnt they find a way to disperse this wealth.2. How can Capitalism survive the next 100 years?The world will have nothing more to give, in time as resources deplete there will be nothing more to capitalize on. The oceans will get emptier and are getting empty as we speak, there will be less forests there will be more pollution in the world the world will become hotter and the difference between rich and poor will be greater... 1 man has more money than 500 million people.

Is it possible that a change to another political system is not possible because Socialism and Communism failed so Hard? Capitalism seems bad to me but it is one of the best systems so far. But its not good enough... Cant we do better?4. Is capitalism to blame for the narcisssim that has arose these past 10 years? All the i want to be famous i am cool me me me and me? Wont that just lead to more of it and more extreme forms of it where it becomes the norm?5. How do u cope with things becoming diminished in capitalism?

Now u have multiple and the 1 guitar that was it was the standard now the standard has become the best and by price u get lesser worth and good guitar.

none,"This happened yesterday, but close enough. TLDR at the bottom (important update at the bottom)I've had an obsession with cleaning my ears for years. I also have Excoriation, where I constantly pick at my skin.. I feel like the ear obsession stems from that same mental issues. I always feel better after I clean my ears. It started with cotton swabs, then progressed to a Bobby pin when the cotton swabs started coming out clean too often.Every now and then I'll go too hard with the pin and my ears will get sore. I normally have enough common sense to stop cleaning them when this happens, but two days ago my ear was just so damn itchy. So I went for it. I tried to be gentle, but you know, a metal bobby-pin plus irritated skin... it didn't end well. My ear was more sore than before, but still not too badThen comes yesterday. My ear was still just as sore, but again sooooooo damn itchy. So I went for it and instead of the usual pale earwax I got a small amount of green earwax and what I could only assume was puss. I mean why else would it be green? It also hurt hella bad while I was in there digging around. My ignorant ass then thought ‘Well, if I just leave it alone now it'll get better right?'Wrong... very wrong.That was around 11am. By the time I was done with work, it was suuuuper sore to the touch. That was around 6. Again, I hoped it would just get better so I kept it to myself. Then come around 11, it was so sore and throbbing it gave me a massive headache. I had to tell my husband at that point as I couldn't hide it anymore. I then suffered through the worst night of sleep I've ever had only to wake up with the pain being even worse. This was the worse pain I've ever experienced in my life. Throbbing, sharp pains in my ear. Unable to talk because my jaw hurts so dame bad.I went to the dr today and yep. I have an ear infection. The ear drops and ibuprofen help with the pain right after I take them, but then the pain comes and goes. On a scale of 1-10 it usually ranges from a 5-7. I literally feel like I'm dying at points only for it to subside again for a blessed few moments..TLDR: I clean my ears excessively and caused myself to get an ear infection, giving myself the worse pain I've ever experienced in my lifePSA: do not clean in your ear hole. It's not worth itUpdate: I had to go back today to get an ear wick put in my ear as the drops weren't able to go in. Very unpleasant. 10/10 would not recommend. They did give me some pain meds, though I have to ration them out to make them last over the next few days, so I'll still be suffering through the worst pain of my life.. again, I beg you all, do not clean inside your ear hole. I wouldn't wish this pain on anyoneImportant Update: I finished my 14 days of ear drops for the ear infection in my left ear. I went back and had a different ear infection in my right ear, even though I was taking the drops in the right ear too. They put me on oral antibiotics (Bactrim). 9 days later I have a heat rash on my cheeks and left arm. Then while I'm debating if I should just ignore it, the back of my legs break out in splotchy welts that itch like hell. I got a steroid shot 5 hours ago to stop the reaction and it didn't really fully take care of it.. I have prednisone for the rest of the week, but I'm going to miserable for the next 12-48 hours as I wait for the antibiotics to leave my system.Again, I beg you all.. DONT STICK ANYTHING IN YOUR EARHOLEEdit: I changed left ear to right ear in a couple of sentences."

He does way too much damage than he should (literally took away almost all of Raider's health bar in 1-2 combos). I always hated fighting them, but this puts it on a whole other level of f*ckery. All I would say is keep the new moves they added to him, but they absolutely have to nerf the damage he does. Other than that, he's awesome.

none,"Just to write down a tip I know about bone broth, (according to my wife and my experiments so far)There's a limitation of drawing the nutrition out of the bone. Boiling it twice the time doesn't make it twice deeper. I saw this Korean cooking show several years ago and there were two women talking about their traditional method.It's simple. Boil the bones in water for a certain amount of time. Pour the broth in a bowl and keep it cool. Add a new water in the pot and start boiling again. Repeat this and you will get three different batch of bone broth. And they have their own secret ratio to mix those three which becomes the ultimate bone broth.We tried this many times and it's true. The three of them have distinct characteristics. I can't tell scientifically but my gut tells me after a certain point the water becomes too dense and cannot draw any more nutritions out of the bones. From my experience the first batch(tried with beef bone) is yellowish and the last batch is white as milk.At ours, the broth normally becomes [Seolleongtang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seolleongtang).Edit:I just found a note of an experiment.We used 2kgs of beef bones and 600g of shank at that time. ### Preparation 1.	Put the bone in the pot of water2.	Put it on high heat and stop once boiling. 3.	Drain the water and wash the bone and the meat around the bone (to get rid of impurity)### First batch1.	Grill spring onion and onion (almost right before burning them)2.	Pour the 3 times of water of the amount of bones (sorry for my English but I don't know how to express this correctly. I appreciate if anyone teaches me )3.	Add spring onion, onion, big chunks of radish and boil them for 5 hours.4.	Remove the floating grease every 30 minutes5.	Strain the broth using a cotton cloth, cool down it and once cooled, keep it in the fridge. Hours later there will be a layer of solidified fat on the surface. Remove them.### Second and third batch1.	Pour in the pot the water of 2 times amount of bones.2.	Boil them for 2~3 hours.3.	Remove grease once in a while.4.	Strain, cool, keep in the fridge and remove the fat.### Then, as in SeolleongtangMix all three of them (or you could arbitrarily choose a ratio and experiment on your own, but I couldn't give up any drop of them to be honest), and boil.Serve in a bowl and a steamed rice on the side. Put some salt (actually quite a lot to make it flavorful) and some ground black pepper. And it's almost mandatory to put sliced spring onion (as raw, not cooked).We normally put the rice in the soup and eat them and radish kimchi is a perfect companion.https://youtu.be/52RVFck8uO4"

none,"I've experienced eggplants in Korea and France. They are quite different. The Korean ones are thinner and longer. Its skin is softer,  tastes creamer, and smells fragrant. On the other hand, the eggplants in  France are oval and have the texture of meat. It is less fragrant and a  little bitter.In Korea, the most common way to cook eggplants is to steam and  season them. I tried the same way with the eggplants here in France, and  the skin was a little tough, which ruined the texture. So last week, I  did a lot of experiments with eggplants. Including last week, I've cooked many Korean eggplant dishes in France, using these methods:* to steam and season* to steam and make it a cold soup (a little sour and refreshing, mostly for Summer)* to grill and season* to grill, season and grill again* to braise* to deep-fry* to salt eggplants to draw out excess moisture and cook rice with themOh, I sun-dried the eggplants last year. I'm looking forward to  trying it out one day. After all this, I'm becoming friends with French  eggplants. I'm also figuring out the differences between Korean  eggplants and the ones here and what I should be cautious of. One thing  for sure is that steaming this type of eggplants didn't work out well.So, is eggplant yay or nay to you? If yay, how do you cook it? If  nay, why do you not like it?"

Yangjo Ganjang (soy sauce)-	1 Tbsp.  Chosun Ganjang (soy sauce)_-	1  minced ginger-	5  garlic-	2  green chilli pepper-	1 tsp.  honey with mild scent**Recipe****1. Prepare the beef and initial boilling**Cut the beef into four square cubes and wash them in cold water.Put a pot of lots of water on high heat. When boiling, add the beef.When it starts to boil again, put the beef into a bowl of cold water. Cool it down and wash the surface.**2. Simmer the beef and prepare the vegetables**In a small and deep pot, add the beef, water, cooking wine, Shiitake, spring onion, and Dashima(Kombu). Put it on low heat.After 20 minutes, remove the Dashima and boil for one more hour. Skim the broth.Cut the cloves of garlic in half.Cut the pepper diagonally.Strain it with a cotton cloth and keep the broth separately.**3. Simmer in the sauce**Clean the pot and add the beef, the broth, the sauce for simmering, the minced ginger. Simmer them on a low heat for 15 minutes. Add the green pepper, the garlic and simmer for another 5 more minutes. You need to spoon the sauce over the beef from time to time.Turn off the heat, add the honey, stir it, close the lid and let it rest.Right before serving, pull the beef into thin strips, soak in the sauce and then serve.**Note**You need to boil the beef lightly and wash it in cold water to remove bad odor and impurities. The bad odor comes from the gas made by bacterias living on the surface of the meat. The bacterias die at around 70°C (158°F). So the initial boiling and cleaning of the surface will remove the bad odor issue.If you pull the beef and simmer it, it will absorb the excessive sauce and become too salty as time goes. So it's good to pull it right before eating."

Does anyone know how to select the tasks in ""Today"" bucket?I thought ""startDate"" was the one I needed.The simplified version of the query I've been using is:    SELECT *      FROM TMTask    WHERE startDate = ${timestamp} AND           startBucket = 0 AND           status = 0 AND           trashed = 0and the `timestamp`  is calculated with JS like this    const today = new Date();    const beginningOfToday = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), today.getDate());    const timestamp = (beginningOfToday.getTime() - beginningOfToday.getTimezoneOffset()*60*1000)/1000;But I realized my understanding of the database schema was wrong. That way it only showed me the tasks added to ""Today"" **for the first time today**. If a task was added to ""Today"" yesterday and I couldn't finish it then, but it's still in Today now, but this query won't fetch it, because the startDate of the task is yesterday.What else column should I use?edit @ 25 febOkay, I've got it. It's simpler than I expected:    trashed = 0 AND    status = 0 AND    type = 0 AND     start = 1 AND    startdate IS NOT NULLthis is the condition to get tasks from Today."
none,"Today is Korean lunar new year!While my wife and I don't live in Korea right now, we still cook holiday food. (Korean recipe + French ingredients = amazing food 🔥)I grew up with both working parents. My parents were busy. I think my mom didn't have a chance to develop her cooking skill because she was too busy working. I was a weak boy. They were worried. So they obsessed with feeding me. Forced eating + not tasty food led me to hate eating. I pushed food into my mouth. I showed them my empty rice bowl, casually walked away, went to the toilet, quietly dumped them into the toilet and pretended to pee.On the other hand, my wife's parents have been running a couple of restaurants more than 20 years. Her mom used to cook many different kind of traditional cookies. Her grandma lived nearby. She grew up appreciating good ingredients and good food.When I started working and living alone I too started to appreciate good food and realized ""not all healthy food sucks"". Especially after the marriage, I've been a big fan of my wife's cooking. I'm a cheerleader and a cleaner to make a base for her to enjoy her cooking. And as always the traditional holiday comes. Even though we don't live in Korea, she still loves cooking traditional holiday foods and share them with people. Now it's not possible to do so, but she still cooked and I'm the happy one to get to enjoy all of them.https://imgur.com/a/vDoMkZs/I wish I can introduce every single dish about how they're made, how other most Korean people cook them, but how my wife cooks them the way her grandma and her mom cook (slow, traditional and sometimes hard). But for now, I'm introducing two very simple recipes. (All the recipes and the pictures are by my wife)## 1. 숙주나물 (Seasoned mung bean sprouts)https://imgur.com/a/6RRCp8j/4 servings-	500 g(1.1lb)  mung bean sprouts-	½ tsp.  minced garlic-	1 Tbsp.  chopped spring onion-	1 tsp.  roasted salt-	1 tsp.  sesame oil-	½ Tbsp.  roasted sesame### 1. Prepare ingredientsTrim off the heads and tails of mung bean sprouts. Lightly wash them.Boil water, pour the mung bean sprouts for 2 minutes, and quickly rinse them in cold water.Strain the mung bean sprouts and tilt them a little to remove excess water.### 2. SeasonIn a bowl, pour mung bean sprouts, minced garlic, chopped spring onion, and salt and mix them.Add sesame oil and sesame, and mix them.### noteThis dish is supposed to be clean, so I don't put too much garlic or spring onion.I like it crunchy, so I don't squeeze it too hard when straining. If I do, it becomes too chewy and could have a bad smell.Roasted sea salt goes well with seasoned vegetables. It's less salty and less bitter. It gives the dish soft umami.## 2. 수정과 (Sujeonggwa, Korean cinnamon punch)https://imgur.com/a/m5nElVk/We usually drink it as-is, but traditionally we put dried persimmon inside it, let it soak, serve it with a couple of pine nuts floating on top and enjoy it. (The picture above is Sujeonggwa with dried fig, instead.)If you put a dried persimmon, its flavor is softly spread to Sujeonggwa and gives rich sweetness. The soaked persimmon is a good dessert after the drink. It's a different experience than just drinking Sujeonggwa only.**Steeping ginger**-	50 g  ginger-	1.2 ℓ  water**Steeping cinnamon**-	35 g  cinnamon-	1.2 ℓ  water-	2 Tbsp.  dark brown sugar-	100 g  light brown sugar-	dried persimmon-	pine nuts(Or)**Steeping ginger**-	1.8 oz  ginger-	2.5 pints  water**Steeping cinnamon**-	1.2 oz  cinnamon-	2.5 pints  water-	2 Tbsp.  dark brown sugar-	3.5 oz  light brown sugar-	dried persimmon-	pine nuts### 1. Steep ginger and cinnamonSlice the ginger after peeling. Wash the cinnamon. Preferably use the Cassia cinnamon over the Ceylon cinnamon.Put them in separate pots on high heat.Once boiling, put it on low-medium heat for 30 minutes to steep.### 2. Blend and boilPrepare a big pot and put a colander and a cotton cloth.Pour both pots of the ginger and the cinnamon over it.Add sugar to the pot and put on high heat.Once boiling, turn off the heat, open the lid and let it cool down.Once cooled down, store in the fridge and enjoy it cold.### NoteThe reason why we steep ginger and cinnamon separately is to maximize the flavors. Because both have their own strong flavor, it's better to steep them separately and later blend them."

none,"She recently bought a cleaver and a boning knife. We're from Korea and our meal table is always full of vegetables but they're so delicious and I rarely crave meat. (I used to be a big fan of meat before got married)She feels a little bit difficult to digest when she has beef or pork. As I get older (still young though), I cannot eat meat as much as I did before. So recently we're having chicken when we crave meat. As a picky cook she always tries to start with a good foundation: ingredients. Instead of buying a chopped chicken from supermarket, she went to the traditional market and got fresh ones (we live in France now). They have whole chickens with everything still attached including head, etc. And they normally trim some of the parts.Now she wants to learn how to chop them by herself at home and even debone them. After trying it once with our knife, she decided to buy proper ones. Et voilà! They are awesome.Today she chopped 1.9kg of chicken and cooked [Jjimdak](https://g.co/kgs/S9pyzS).

You might find tiny broken bones here and there.* Boil water and pour the chicken inside. After boiling it lightly, strain the chicken. (This is to get rid of bad smell, etc)* Put the chicken and the water in a pot on a high heat.* Mix all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl.* When boiling, put the sauce in the pot.* Lower the heat to medium.* When it's a bit reduced, add the potato.* When the potatoes are half-cooked, add the onion and carrot.* It's not a soup, so take your time and braise it until the water gets reduced (like at least an hour).* When the water is reduced to 1/3, add the glass noodle and the red pepper.* When the noodle is done, add the rest of ""ingredients for later"". Stir it and serve it almost right after that.Edit: The recipe has been edited a bit.Edit2: Got too many requests.

none,"It adds umami and sweetness to soups, seasoned soy sauce, kimchi, etc. It's used not only for broth but also for side dishes, thanks to its savory flavor. We often dry-fry them crispy and enjoy them with alcoholic drinks.There are some well-known ways to enhance broth with anchovy. You can cook something with whole anchovies in it. You can make an anchovy broth first and then use the broth for cooking something. Or, you can grind the anchovies and put the powder in the food. They all have pros and cons.If you put the whole anchovies, you can save time, not making broth. When you eat the soup, it's fun to pick and eat the anchovies. As you make the soup, the spices you put for the soup go into the anchovies, and its originally tough texture (because it was dried) becomes tender and properly chewy. However, it's not a good fit for food you need to cook for a long time. The anchovies will become mushy, make the soup unclear, and make it taste bitter. Before using the anchovies, you need to prepare them first. First, get rid of the head and intestines, which makes a bitter taste. Then, dry-fry them to get rid of the moisture and the odor. However, even if you prepare them well, if the anchovies get heated for a certain amount of time, it makes a bitter taste.If you make broth first, it takes time, but you can make a consistent taste regardless of cooking time. As said before, if you cook anchovies too long, it makes a bitter taste. However, if you cook it too short, you can't get enough taste out of it. How can we make anchovy broth which isn't bitter? A good way is to soak anchovies in cold water for a long time and boil them for a short time. After you soak them in cold water for 10 hours in a fridge, it will have a light and pleasantly sweet taste, almost like green tea. Now put them in a pot on medium to high heat. When it's about to boil, turn down the heat to medium to low. Heat them for 10 to 15 minutes without boiling. After that, strain them through cotton clothes. It will have a deep and clear taste. Once cooled, freeze them in ice cube trays or small containers. You can use them later with water.If you grind anchovies, it's easy to bring flavor to food. It's convenient to have a batch of ground anchovies prepared. However, the powder spreads in the soup. So avoid using it in a soup with clear and lots of liquid. It works well with thick soups or heavy food like Jjigae.https://imgur.com/a/buTRolg/"

none,"This happened like two years ago. We're a Korean married couple. My wife is an amazing cook.Once in a while she makes broth and store them in small containers in freezer. She normally makes seafood broth more frequently than meat broth. She puts Dashima(a.k.a Kombu), dried anchovy, onions, onion peels, spring onions, spring onion roots, mushrooms, etc. I don't know exactly how long she boils it but IIRC, it takes about one hour or two.After work I came home. The day I was a bit tired. So I came home early without telling her as sort of a surprise. She was preparing the dinner in her calm pace but when she saw me early she got surprised.Wife: You're early?Me: Yeah. A bit tired.Wife: The dinner isn't ready. Me: I know. Take your time! Can I help anything?She was just finishing her broth at that time. Once done boilling, she normally puts a big bowl in a sink and put a colander over the bowl and drain the broth. As we had that short conversation, she was draining the broth. She started to pour the pot into the colander and when it almost finished, she started to scream!Yeah... she forgot to put a bowl below the colander. She just dumped all the broth into the sink and ""saved"" only the seafood and stuff which don't have any taste left.She saw me early, got surprised, distracted and made a huge mistake. She was a bit sad but we couldn't stop laughing for minutes. If I remember correctly we had an instant ramen for the dinner that day.It's a fun memory of ours but I'm not sure if I wrote it down well. Anyways, happy holiday and happy new year in advance!"
none,"https://i.imgur.com/cGmZaZl.jpgThis post is about three fish sauces most commonly used in Korea.[Description]It's made by salting and fermenting seafood. There is a variety of Jeotgal, depending on ingredients and way to make it.[Usage]It adds saltiness and umami(pleasant savory taste) to food. It's used in kimchi, Jjim(steaming), Guk(soup), Jjigae(stew), Jorim(simmering), Bokkeum(stir-frying), and Muchim(salad). There is a variety of Jeotgal, but they all come to one conclusion: umami. When seafood is salted and fermented, the saltiness prevents rotting, and it gets fermented slowly. Also, the enzyme from their internal organs and muscles decomposes the seafood. As time goes by, the meat becomes soft, some of the fishy odor disappears, and it gains concentrated umami.It's easy to find Saeu-jeot(salted shrimp), Kkanari aekjeot(fish sauce from Pacific sandlance), and Myeolchi aekjeot(salted anchovy sauce). They are used in many foods.[Saeu-jeot(salted shrimp)](https://i.imgur.com/twYQuzq.jpg)Saeu-jeot is small shrimps that are salted and fermented. It's used in kimchi, Jjim(steaming), Guk(soup), Jjigae(stew), Jorim(simmering), and Bokkeum(stir-frying). When you add saltiness to food, it's rare to use Saeu-jeot only. Usually, Ganjang(soy sauce) or salt are used together. Saeu-jeot is good with cabbage, Chinese cabbage, radish, bean sprout, pork, zucchini, egg, tofu, etc.Saeu-jeot is not oily. It has a refreshing and savory taste. When used in radish or cabbage kimchi, Saeu-jeot adds savory taste while not disturbing the radish or cabbage flavor. It works well when boiling dried pollack soup with cabbage and bean sprouts. It's also paired well with fatty meat like pork. Apart from the taste, it helps digest because it contains the enzyme to decompose fat and protein. A couple of ingredients added to Saeu-jeot is a good sauce for pork dishes. Or, it goes into braised pork or pork stew.[Myeolchi aekjeot(salted anchovy sauce), Kkanari aekjeot(fish sauce from Pacific sandlance)](https://i.imgur.com/gnLQE0S.jpg)They are fish sauce made from salted and fermented anchovy or Kkanari(Pacific sandlance). It's used in kimchi, Jangajji(pickled vegetables), Jjim(steaming), Guk(soup), Jjigae(stew), Jorim(simmering), Bokkeum(stir-frying), and Muchim(salad). You can use them instead of soy sauce or in addition to it. Myeolchi aekjeot has a deep taste and smell. Kkanari aekjeot is relatively subtle and a little sweet.[Storage]Store Saeu-jeot in a sealed container in a freezer. It's too salty to be frozen. So you can use it without defrosting. If Saeu-jeot is too old, you can make a fish sauce out of it by blending, boiling with water and salt added, and straining it with a cotton cloth. It's good to store all the fish sauces in the fridge.[How it's made]Wash the seafood with seawater, drain, and salted them. The amount of salt is 20~40% of the weight of the seafood. The salt percentage depends on many variables like the type of seafood, the condition, the season, and the environment. Mix the seafood with some salt and stack them with the remaining salt in a dark container. With a lid closed, let it fermented in a shady place for 4 to 5 months. To make aekjeot(fish sauce), it needs to be fermented for 6 to 12 months to soften the flesh.**Let me know if you have any question or if you enjoyed reading it **"

Later I learned the temperature of soup isn't that important in Indonesia. If I asked, they'd give me hotter one. To me, a Korean, soup is supposed to be boiling hot. It always has been. That was the moment that it can be different in other cultures.In Korea, we often eat something very hot, temperature-wise. After cooking in Ttukbaegi (clay pot), we often serve the whole Ttukbaegi on the meal table to keep the warmness for a long time. You can see Jjigae, Guk, or Tang like boiling lava in Ttukbaegi. Even if it's not stew-like food, we often eat Bibimbap or something moist in the warm Ttukbaegi.You can see it in every Korean home and every Korean restaurant. You can especially see it a lot in Gukbab restaurants. Gukbab means soup(Guk) + rice(bab). The rice is inside the soup in a Ttukbaegi. When you go to such a place, you will see one Ttukbaegi per person. They eat hot rice in hot soup after blowing once or twice sloppily.

It's dynamic and interactive. I can have this meaty piece medium and that fatty piece welldone, etc.The table consists of many different dishes centered around rice. We eat a spoon of rice and then eat something else. Some Korean people say ""We need side dishes to eat rice"" but some other Korean people say ""We need rice to eat side dishes"". So to exaggerate a little, it's like a white canvas and you're the artist. You can make your own sequence of rice and side dishes. There are heavy flavorful dishes and there are some refreshing dishes as well. That's the beauty.

You can add anything to the rice, especially something in season that will bring you the seasonal flavor and color.I get curious about inside once I smell the rice being cooked in the steam not long after putting the pot on the heat. After waiting until done, I open the lid of the pot. The steam and the smell are warm. The seasonal crops I randomly put are sitting on top of the softly cooked rice.I partially mix the rice with some sauce. Eating it, I again think about rice. What is going to be next rice?https://imgur.com/a/kxTY4NZYou can find [the recipe](https://merearchive.com/post/en/beef-and-mushroom-rice/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post1031&utm_campaign=beef-and-mushroom-rice) here if you want to try ---If you have any question, leave a comment here "
none,These little 11 seeds smell greatly like perilla. I cannot believe my wife and I did it!We're moving soon. So I hope to plant these seeds next year and get lots of harvest!What do we use them for?Mostly perilla kimchi and when we have Korean barbecue (wrapping meats in lettuce AND perilla leaves).Us getting the seeds:https://imgur.com/a/uuGItntThe real Korean grandparents doing in a legit way:https://youtu.be/vx6iCL86lx4

We'll planning to move to a house in this December. I hope these seeds grow amazingly next year 🥰https://imgur.com/a/zih7tEg"
none,"She wanted to buy 10 radishes. According to the price tag, it was around 10 euros. She said ""10"" and the vendor started to bargain. He suggested 30 radishes for 12 euros. So she came home with 30 radishes 😂😂😂She says she's going to make radish kimchi with half of them and another half is going to be watery radish kimchi. For context,the radish kimchi (Kkakdugi): https://g.co/kgs/Hx8RcQthe watery radish kimchi (Dongchimi): https://g.co/kgs/LSsHXT"
none,"Follow-up of https://reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jd36d4/my_wife_just_made_some_kimchi/This morning we put the kimchi in the fridge because its fermentation is quite progressed and we want to slow it down now.For lunch we tried it. It needs to be more fermented but it already tastes so good. The texture is crunchy, properly salty, deliciously spicy!https://imgur.com/a/fPcpLp4/"
none,"Hello everyone,We bought lots of mushrooms to enjoy the flavor of autumn. It's getting colder here in France. My wife cooked steamed rice with mushroom in it. She cooked doenjang jjigae too, which is a sort of fermented soybean soup (hard to explain).Once in a while I'm reminded that we barely eat meat. I'm not a vegetarian. I love meat but somehow I enjoy the food my wife cooks without realizing there isn't any piece of meat on the table. Although we buy eggs and sausages, I think we buy meat at most once a month? I'm saying this because I think Korean food can be a good alternative if you want to consume less meat.Anyway, I put a little spoon of this sauce (soy sauce based) on the mushroom rice. I mixed it a little (just a spoon amount) and eat it. I eat another spoon of rice and now this time I eat some doenjang jjigae. This infinite different combination makes the meal enjoyable. When my mouth feels too heavy, I eat that radish kimchi which is spicy, sour and super refreshing.This legit felt like a perfect autumn meal!What is your autumn meal in your culture?https://imgur.com/a/RAWse3P"
none,"As a Korean couple, it's important for us to keep a certain amount of kimchi in the fridge. Now that we live abroad, once in a while, when we visit Korea, we've got some kimchi to consume for a year or two. But it's getting harder to go back for many reasons including Covid-19.As my wife gets better and better at cooking, she's broadening her area as well. She has made her own kimchi for the first time several months ago. Yesterday we found quite good cabbages in the market. So we decided to make another batch of kimchi.It took almost a full day to make just 5 cabbages of kimchi which is a very small amount compared to what moms do in Korea. Anyway it was tiring but also very fulfilling. And I must say the taste is very close to the one made by my mother in law.I told my wife:Now you're kimchi independent. It's huge.https://imgur.com/a/5i2xPN4/---Edit:Huh! I didn't expect this to take off like this! Is it against the rule if I plug something here? My wife recently started her blog about Korean cooking.She loves cooking things from scratch in traditional and slow ways. If you're interested, give it a visit.

none,"My wife just made some radish kimchi. Since we've moved to France, we've been trying lots of new vegetables and trying to find the overlaps between Korean and French ingredients.We've almost never tried purple radish so far. My wife, however, decided to try them and bought them this morning in the market. And she just made the kimchi out of it and it tastes amazing! It's a good substitute for Korean radish when it comes to Kimchi. We'll let it get fermented for a couple of days outside and when it's properly fermented, then move it inside the fridge to preserve.I'm so excited to taste it when it's done in a couple of days!https://imgur.com/a/Qx3343t/"
none,"Sujeonggwa is one of the most traditional drinks in the Korean holidays. In Korean holidays, people buy good ingredients, put in lots of effort, cook many different kinds of amazing food, and share them. Sujeonggwa shines when it cleanses your mouth and helps your digest after eating that food. Because Korean people normally drink Sujeonggwa when eating traditional holiday food, many think it's challenging to make. However, it's effortless. It's easy to find the ingredients, and it's cheap, too.There are times when I wish there is Sujeonggwa in the fridge: In winter, when the air is stuffy with too much heater, after you take a shower with hot water and you throw yourself down on a sofa, when you need to cleanse your mouth after eating a load of greasy food, etc. It's worth a try to put your little effort and cost. It can make you feel content when you realize that there is Sujeonggwa in the fridge.Recipe:-	50 g Ginger + 1200 ml Water-	35 g Cinnamon + 1200 ml Water-	2 Tbsp. Dark brown sugar-	100 g Light brown sugarSlice the ginger after peeling. Wash the cinnamon. Preferably use the Cassia cinnamon over the Ceylon cinnamon. Put them in separate pots on high heat.Once boiling, put it on low-medium heat for 30 minutes to steep.Prepare a big pot and put a colander and a cotton cloth. Pour both pots of the ginger and the cinnamon over it.Add sugar to the pot and put on high heat. Once boiling, turn off the heat, open the lid and let it cool down.Once cooled down, store in the fridge and enjoy it cold.https://i.imgur.com/DE9eEE3.jpgIf you put a dried persimmon, its flavor is softly spread to Sujeonggwa and gives rich sweetness. The soaked persimmon is a good dessert after the drink. It's a different experience than just drinking Sujeonggwa only. Here in France it's hard to find dried persimmon so the thing in the picture is a dried fig."
none,"Hi, I'm from South Korea. Traditionally we have been drying lots of things: vegetables, seafood, etc.Now I'm living in France, and I don't see as many dried stuff as I saw in Korea (except for sausages and dried fruits). Especially when it comes to seafood, I guess they preserve them in oil and salt. In Korea we even dry fish. One of the reasons why we dry instead of salt might be we have a very dry winter. Unlike Europe's rainy autumn and winter, in Korea summer is extremely humid and in autumn and winter it's crispy dry. Sorry for rambling. My wife and I recently dried some stuff and I wanted to share that and kinda had to give you the context first https://imgur.com/a/B7AXslfHave a great weekend everyone!"
none,"Hello I'm trying to buy my first house these days. There's lots of things that I don't know. I've recently subscribed this subreddit and saw people talking about ""inspection"". I'm not sure if it's a thing in USA or globally(I live in France).When does this inspection happen? Before the contract? Do you hire a person to inspect the house to get a quote and use it to negotiate the final price? Am I thinking correctly?It might be a naive worry but what if the owner doesn't like it and sell it to someone else who is less picky?"

So I listed up a bunch of CFPs, and applied to many of them. And you know what? I've been accepted at two conferences. I'm going there. And I am still waiting for answers from other conferences.

none,"I need advice. What do I tell him? I don't feel I could have a future with him, but we both clearly want to bone each other. Idk. Thoughts?"
none,?
none,"I didn't do it. The entire 3 hours that I was there, i felt awkward, and uncomfortable, and was pretty much a loner. But still, I did not get drunk. I am so pleased with my self. And although I feel a bit hollow and sad even, the relief that I feel now, knowing that I didn't get drunk and do something super regretable is absolutely priceless.To all of the kids just entering your high-school partying years: all I can say, is be very careful. This shit is dangerous, and especially if you are a smaller individual, you will get drunk way to fast if you have too much. Space out your drinks if you drink. Do not succumb to peer pressure. Drinking is all fun and games until something really stupid happens. It can be fun, but if you have no one watching/taking care of you during the night, it can also be super duper scary. Bad things can happen. I'm just being honest. Please stay safe everyone! Thats all."
none,I feel worthless. And weak. And broken. And I feel very very very unfixable. I don't feel like I deserve good things. I just deserve to die.
none,"I have no family in my life. No true friends.I live on my own. I made some drunk mistakes this weekend that I genuinely can't remember. I think I may have been drugged and raped at my first graduation party I ever went to. I am supposed to be graduating in two days. I want to kill myself. I just don't see a point. I am currently spending my birthday alone, in my house, lying on my bed contemplating ending everything. Only two people told me happy birthday today. But its okay because this isn't a happy day for me anyways. That's all."
none,"So there is this girl who I have been friends with for a couple of months. Last night she invited me to this small party with our grad class, where everyone was drinking a lot and getting super drunk. I don't drink often, so I got super hammered as one does, and apparently was saying and doing a whole bunch of crazy stuff. This is all according to my 'friend', who was basically telling me that I am a horrible person to be around when I am drunk. My family member very recently passed away so apparently I was crying on one of guy friends shoulder and he was comforting me for a good portion of the night. My girl 'friend' told me I was screaming that I almost had sex with a friend of mine at the very end of the night. Which I cannot even remember. She also told me that I wanted to knock this same guy out, as I guess someone told me that I was really mad because he kissed another girl that night? I don't even know. All I know is that I don't remember any of it, and I don't remember kissing anyone. I do remember that guy with me in the bushes though, we did not have sex or anything, but he WAS kissing me up and down my neck and I told him it felt good but I wanted to stop because it was too soon or some shit (idk I was absolutely hammered this is the faintest memory I have from the entire night). Apparently I told this same guy that I was in love with him. I don't even know. But I may be allergic to alcohol I think and everyone kept feeding me liquor all night. Shot gunning and shots. When I got to work today, my girl 'friends told me that I was pretty much a garbage person all night and that I could never drink around her again and that she wanted to fight me so bad all night. Apparentky I was screaming at the top of my lungs that I was going to kill the guy that was kissing me in the bushes. I genuinely don't even remember this. I feel like a horrible person and I feel like nothing will ever make me feel better. I work multiple jobs, and don't live with any of my family members and have no contact with them. So I saw this party invite as an opportunity to let loose a bit. But I way over did it with the alcohol and made some mistakes apparently. I don't know. I don't feel okay. I have no one to turn to in this moment. I wish all of this pain and regret that I feel would just go away. If I could go back in time I would have never even gone to this party. Now my 'friend' basically told me she doesn't want to be friends with me any more. I have no one. I am so alone. Also just an FYI... I am a Virgin, and I've never even had my first kiss with a boy before. Thats why I think I got so mad maybe? I don't know. All I know is that I was way too drunk and made some bad choices I think that I cannot remember."
none,"I literally hate my life. I work 3 jobs in order to support myself. My 18th birthday is coming up this month. I am also graduating high-school this month. I live by myself and have no contact with my abusive family. I am so alone in this sad, cold, dead, scary world. I have no one. I am nothing. And if I'm being honest, I don't really want to be here anymore. It hurts too much."
none,"I don't like my grad class. I don't have much family to celebrate with. My last-minute grad date is someone who I have never talked to before and I'm pretty sure he has a crush on me. I don't want to go with him. Today we had a 'grad event' off the record where you buy your grad date alcohol and get them super drunk. I wasted so much money, and I can honestly say that I regret every single second of it. If I could go back in time, I would never have participated in this event and just saved my hard earned money instead. I work three jobs...so I know money can't just be wasted on stupid shit like this.Long story short;I didn't like the grad event today and I regret participating. I think I am going to regret going to grad ceremonies because I feel like I will regret it. One of my friends keeps pressuring me into doing grad stuff and she keeps trying to make me excited about it.But This isn't fun for me. My mental health is bad right now. And I am not going to my graduation. I don't like my last minute grad date also and I think it is really weird that I would have to walk with him and celebrate this event with him even though I have barely even talked to him before. I wouldn't enjoy myself if I went, and I know that. T"

But as long as you have a nice meal and a hot shower at the end of the day, then I can promise you that everything is going to be okay. Remember to stay hydrated, wear sunscreen, be kind and act confident...(Yeah I know...easier said then done). But if all else fails, get into your comfy bed with a bowl of ice cream and Netflix or YouTube the night (or day!) Away, and try again tomorrow. I love you.I see you.I know how hard you are trying.I think that you are so beautiful and brave. Always remember to treat yourself with kindness, because you are worthy of love, too. Xo ♡"
none,"I hate my parents. They abused me, and now that I am no longer in contact with them, they act like nothing that they ever did was wrong. My sister was abused by them too. She turned to drugs to deal with her emotions (due to my abusive parents), and was murdered while trafficking. I will ultimately blame my parents for her death until the day I die. I hate my mom, she never helped me when my dad was beating on me. I used to cry for her to come help me. I used to scream for her to come save me. But she would only ignore it, or end up beating me more. my parents are stupid, terrible evil people, and I wish they were dead instead of my sister. one memory that plays in my mind every day is my dad jacking off in front of me, towards me. how can i love someone like that? that strangled my sister then made me terrified to tell the truth when CPS asked me if it was true? when my parents die, i will be the first to admit that they fuckibg deserved it. I hate them both with my entire being, nothing could ever change that. hopefully one day I won't have to be so fking angry anymore. maybe one day I can heal. but for now, all I feel is rage."

none,"absolutely nuts I know. But i used to have the biggest eating disorder ever. Like i literally would not eat anything all day except for like rice cakes and cucumbers and shiz. When I ate anything like pizza, ice cream, and ESPECIALLY chips, i used to make myself throw up shortly after. One of my biggest fears was being considered 'fat'. However, now that I am soooo busy with work and school, my body has was pretty much told me that 'i was going to pass out and die after running on nothing but fumes all day everyday', if I kept this system up. So... i eat. On my lunch breaks I actually consume food. and When I get home I allow myself to eat ice cream even. I know it's completely warped. But long story short, working 3 jobs on top of school might have saved my life."
none,I just found one that was still up from last march...it got like 300 likes and a load of comments saying that my singing was really amazing. But idk why I am literally so embarrassed. Idk. I just don't know.
none,"Today in my auto mechanics class I made a mistake and wayyyy over-torqued the spark plugs on a snowmobile which ended up breaking them. (this, I learned, is a common mistake for newbies such as myself). anyhow, my teacher un-intentionally humiliated me in front of other classmates (boys also as this is a male-dominant class). My heart was pounding, and my anxiety was at an absolute all-time high in this moment. I genuinely felt like I was going to die. or throw up. Or both. I was getting flashbacks of when I used to accidentally do something wrong growing up (ie:break something, drop a plate, knock over a glass etc), and I was really genuinely terrified in this moment, although I may not have seemed this way. As my shop teacher (middle aged male) was showing me the PROPER way that I should have torqued the spark plugs, I thought I was going to pass out. I was really humiliated and embarrassed with myself, and I felt as though I was going to pass out. I was sweating and shaking uncontrollably and I truly don't know how I saved myself from throwing up. I honestly could have. Anyways yeah so this is my little vent here. I have no idea if i will ever feel safe around men, and especially confrontation of any sort revolving around men. My father used to beat me and tell me he was going to kill me and murder me when I used to do things wrong. This is something that I live with everyday that no one knows about. I guess my little message here is to just be gentle with people. You never know why someone is the way that they are, and also, ...people are not always as strong as they seem. I am a great example of this. ....even thinking about this scenario right this moment is making my anxiety high all over again and i am sweating and shaking all over again. Middle aged men (and especially confrontation with them) genuinely terrifies me and I don't think I am ever going to be strong enough to stop feeling this way. It hurts."
none,Most girls my age have had a boyfriend already. all my friends seem so happy with their partners...I am always the one rocking alone. I know that I come with a lot of trauma from my past/emotional baggage. I feel like I am always going to be 'too much' for any man that I meet. It's not fair. All I want is someone who understands me and loves me in an unconditional way. i genuinley don't think I have ever felt real love from a boy before. I know what I bring to the table. I know I would be an amazing girlfriend. I just feel like i'll never get to that stage with any boy. I am always 'too much' or 'too little' it seems. that's all.
none,"To me, life means never giving up on the things that make you happy. Even if you suck at them. Even if you aren't perfect at what you do. If it makes you happy, then keep doing it until you ARE good at it. Life to me, is not giving a damn about what other people think of you. Life to me, is doing things because YOU enjoy them. Life to me, is being unnecessarily kind to strangers, being authentic as all hell, and giving everything all that you've got. To me, life thus far, has been about never giving up on the things that make me scream 'yes' internally. in my experience, mistakes only make you more humble, and more strong. They give you the courage to live life unapologetically. To whomever is reading this: i hope you find the courage to keep on going after making mistakes. learn. grown. inspire. flourish. and don't ever beat yourself down for silly little things. we are all going to be okay.

none,"I was working on this stupid car and sooo much shit kept going wrong. was literally just doing an oil change too. First off, the filter was on there SO TIGHT, it was legit GORILLA TORQUE. I had to get my shop teacher to get it off...and even he said that he had NEVER seen an oil filter on there THAT tight. anyways that took a really embarrassing amount of time. Next up, I was checking the coolant levels, break fluid levels, windshield washer fluid etc + topping up as necessary. and what happens? I ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED THE BREAK FLUID CAP AND IT WENT DOWN THE ENGINE BASE SOOOOO FAR. the entire class was trying to get it. NO ONE COULD FIND IT!!! It took me soooo long to find it. I was crawling underneath the entire car until FINALLY I FOUND IT. OMG. AND GUESS WHAT? THE BREAK FLUID WAS FULL ANYWAY SO I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO TAKE THE CAP OFF IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! next...the car was on jack stands. The girl who was helping me with this project ended up ditching class early WITHOUT TELLING ME, so i was by myself at this point. it took me asking the teacher approximately 17987497898 times ""where do I place the floor jack"" as most of the underside of the car was plastic...i could feel that my teacher was getting pissed off at me, but he finally ended up helping me out. ANYWAY YEAH A WHOLE BUNCH OF SHIT WENT WRONG TODAY, AND I AM SO EMBARRASSED. I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE SEES ME AS AN INCOMPETENT LITTLE GIRL IN THAT CLASS NOW. I FEEL ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HORRIBLE AND FEEL AS THOUGH I AM NOW A BAD REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN MECHANICS. i feel especially horrible as I am wanting to take mechanics in college...ps, NEVER BUY A HYUNDAI THEY ARE HORRIBLE OMG. rant over."
none,"So this is my last semester of highschool. I have taken auto mechanics for the very first time this semester, and am really enjoying it.

I want to take the course because I am really interested in the automotive industry, but I am so scared of what people will think of me. I don't want to get some kind of stupid stigma around me. I don't want people to think that I am a lesbian, because I'm not (not that there's anything wrong with that if you are).

none,you are doing so well... keep going!! you got this ;)
none,You. I see you. You are doing a good job. Be gentle on yourself. I love you sweet human!!! you are awesome!!!!
none,"I live by myself, - I've had to cut my parents out of the picture as they were abusive and manipulative throughout my life. Although I am SO blessed to have such a cozy, cute, wonderful little home to live in...the weight of my life, and all that it means to be me...is still really heavy. I work two jobs. I take care of myself. I do everything that needs to be done for myself, like: grocery shopping, attending school and maintaining my car. Realistically, I am doing pretty dang well in life. But...I am so lonely. I just need to get that off of my chest. I have all of these people around me and in my life...but the bond that I am supposed to have between my parents and immediate family is always missing. I have had to grow up so quickly, and often wish that I could just be a normal teenager. I always have this pang of jealousy when I see people my age just doing wholesome things out-and-about with their parents. I feel jealous, because I wish it was me. I wish I could feel the love that I so deeply crave...but I know I will never be able to truly receive from the two people who are supposed to mean the most to me. That's all, - just wanted to get this out. ....also side note: be kind. You never know what people are going through. everyone you meet is facing a battle that you know nothing about. Be nice to each other out there. xo"
none,"the truth about me, is that i love to give. Nothing, and i mean NOTHING makes me happier inside than doing things for other people. i love smiling at strangers. i love buying my co workers and friends coffee from time to time. i love complimenting people. i love baking people cakes, and cookies, and brownies and apple crumble. i love giving people tender and sincere gifts. i love letting people cut ahead of me in traffic. i love playing silly songs on my guitar for little kids. i love making people birthday and Christmas cards. i love anything that makes other people around me happy. i just sincerely love to help other people. it makes me so happy to see other people happy.  thanks for letting me scream this out into the internet void "
none,"so both myself (17 F) and my crush (16M) live in the same small town. whenever i am driving through town and notice him driving on the otherside of the road, or if i see him parked beside me at a red light - I SMILE LIKE AN ABSOLUTE IDIOT!!!!! i dont know why I do this!!! is this weird?! (side note : my crush and myself have never really talked, - i just see him around and i just think he is really cute and think he is probably super nice). any thoughts?? SOMEONE TELL ME IF HE THINKS IM A CREEP"
none,lol
none,"alright reddit community, here goes nothin. im asking you guys for a hand in this one. So here's the situation - I, (F17), am in grade 12 (highschool), and i have THE BIGGEST most GINORMOUS crush on this guy in grade 11 (one year below me). I ADORE THIS MAN FOR SO MANY REASONS...the only problem is...IVE NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM!! ...like EVER!!! lol. I am pretty postitive he is interested in me as well however, and this is why - - - i notice him checkin' me out EVERY single time i pass him in the hall, walk by him outside, etc. AND EACH TIME I NOTICE HIM DOING THIS I FREAK OUT INSIDE BECAUSE HE IS SO CUTE OMG!!!! hahah - anyways... i think he is a pretty shy guy. don't get me wrong, im pretty shy around new people too...but we have one mutual friend - so i might use this to my advantage lol. please guys...you gotta give me some tips! i need to stop looking the other way when i notice him shooting me those quick glances in the hall or he's gonna think i dont like him! how should i get a friendship going with him!? god, he is SO CUTE!!! any tips or feedback is welcome, and GREATLY appreciated! haha!! thank you all "
none,"I have no friends. Nope. None. Not even a single one. I feel like a worthless piece of nothing. I'm going to therapy right now to try and deal with the abuse I've suffered my entire life from my parents. Oh, btw - I live by myself and I have no parents or siblings to rely on. I'm so alone and it hurts like hell 🙂"
none,I don't know what it is about him. When I see him I literally get chills! He's everything that I want in a guy. I want to get to know him more. I need him to be mine. I know that sounds crazy. But I just feel such a strong pull towards him. Should I make the first move?
none,"I honestly haven't had a crush on someone for so long. (And when I say long, I mean the last genuine crush I've had on someone, was when I was 11!!) So this is all very new for me. The thing is...I don't know this guy personally. I mean, we both know OF each other and I have him on Facebook and Instagram (which he likes EVERYTHING that I post on both platforms, EEK!!!), but we have never really had a true one-on-one conversation...EVER!! But every time I see him around our small hometown, I get SO many butterflies. God, he is SO cute, it actually hurts!!! Lol! He's perceivably everything that I want in a guy...he seems so smart, compassionate and hardworking. I wish I knew him better. Ugh I feel like such a creepy stalker typing this out lol!! Am I going crazy, or am I just crushing really hard?!"
none,"Well, this is it. I finally am going to do it. This world has treated me bad. Maybe it's because I'm bad. I ruin everyone and everything around me. I am so alone in this world. It's cold here and it's dark. Nobody loves me. I need to die. I need to do this. I'll finally give the people what they want. I'll do it. My letters are all written out. I hope my best friend knows that I love her, and that I am sorry for hurting her with that text message. I hope my family knows that I forgive them for abusing me...even my dad. I hope everyone knows that I love them. Bye everyone. Hope this makes everyone feel better"
none,Anything I do...I always feel like a failure afterwards. I feel ugly when I laugh and smile. I just have such low self esteem that it isn't even funny anymore. I'm so depressed.i live by myself and I have no friends. Nobody thinks I'm good enough. My parents never wanted me and were abusing me so that is why I ran away at 16. I am so alone in this world. Nobody likes me because i am ugly and awkward. I want to die so bad sometimes.
none,"Sorry for posting this; I just need to get it out somewhere. I was driving by myeswlf today - I am a very new driver ( I have my license though). I stopped at the stop sign...which had a blind hill above it. I only veryyyyy briefly stopped then something in my head was like okay it is safe to go now because you stopped”. But as soon as I started going a big white pick-up truck came flying down the hill above the sign, so I put the peddle to the meddle and nearly missed getting hit by the truck. I could have died. I'm so in shock and terrified to ever drive again. I am humiliated and I feel like such a bad person and driver, just needed to get it off of my chest."
none,"I'll cut to the chase. I've been abused my entire life. My mental health is at an all time low. I need help with these weird crazy and terrible thoughts in my mind. The problem is though, that whenever I am in a session with my therapist, we only usually end up talking about things that don't even matter... like how to save the walnuts in my front yard properly, and how to bake Instagram worthy artisanal banana bread. I don't want to talk about these trivial, stupid things. I want to talk about my trauma. I want to process my abuse properly. I want to stop having PTSD nightmares. I want to not feel like killing myself is a reasonable option. Can someone please offer any advice on how to open up to her? It would be greatly appreciated."
none,I don't know what to do. Any help or advice?
none,"I already failed it once. For too many reasons to count, I really need it at this point in my life. There's no point in living anymore if I don't get it this time"

none,"So I'm in the process of getting my own apartment and getting out of a very abusive environment and I'm honestly really scared. I don't have my drivers license yet so it's a really difficult situation for me, and I just feel like I have no one to turn to, and nobody that cares about me or my well being. It hurts a lot. I'm scared about how I'm going to have to walk home from work at night (I'm a grocery cleark...so essential) especially. I'm scared about how I am going to be spending some very lonely nights by myself. I'm just so scared. But I'm so sick and tired of being hit and emotionally tormented. Am I doing the right thing?"
none,"I'm so ashamed. I called her mean and rude things in these texts. I meant to send them to myself , because I do that when someone or something is bothering me/making me feel bad...kinda like a diary or a journal I suppose. And in diaries, sometimes people write incriminating and horribly rude and mean things. This sure was the case for me. I feel horrible...so horrible that I went into the school bathroom and started vomiting uncontrollably(IK, TMI). I tried texting her after it happened, and tried profusely apologizing to her and I explained that I never meant for her to see it. I think that only made things worse though. I don't know how I will ever fix this. Does this make me a terrible person?! I'm feeling really sad and alone right now. And if I'm being honest...I meant the things tht I said about her...even though she is usually the nicest person ever, she is just SO into this I'm better than everyone else” mentality. It's been exhausting m, especially for me lately. I feel like I'm going crazy and that everyone hates me. Someone please offer any advice."
none,"I know. This makes me sound like a HORRIBLE PERSON. I meant to send the text to my brother about my friend but I checked the sender (after I got all my aggression and sadness/anger/frustration out through text) and it turns out the recipient wasn't my brother...it was my friend. I feel like my world is going to end. I quickly deleted it all as fast as I could, but she had still seen it all...or most of it, and that is enough. Me and this girl have been friend for my whole life. I am 16 and she is 17. As soon as I realized that I made a huge mistake, I started shaking frantically and my heart almost beat out of my chest. The more I look at this situation, the less my friend is in the wrong, and the more I am in the wrong. After this incident happened with me frantically typing away and sending horrible texts about her in front of her face, I couldn't even say anything. I was mortified. I I sent the texts (it turned out she had already seen them at this point) and simply walked away. I didn't know what to say. I seriously just took out all of my aggression on one of my best friends, over text, in front of her. And won't get into what the texts said too much, but basically they were saying:  she always thinks she's better than me, and always makes me feel bad” and so forth. And guess what...I started the whole schpiel off by typing:  *blank* is so annoying. I got so scared and angry at myself afterwards that I threw up in the bathroom and cut my wrist. I deserved it. I went home early , to filled with guilt and too ashamed to continue on throughout the day, and now here I lye, writing this on reddit in my bed, hoping someone could share some advice. Also, I already tried messaging her saying, : I know you saw what I sent you...and I'm so sorry” and so forth. In these texts of me apologizing, I wrote how some of the things i said about her were true, and tht I was really sad latley and depressed(I never talk about things like this with her, EVER because I've seen how she handles those types of situations....she simply cuts people off if they are feeling suicidal or sad. I feel awful and I wish I could turn back time to not send those texts, because now I fear I've lost my longest best friend for good, only at the age of 16. Please, somebody help me."
none,"Hey everyone, so today I had an early morning shift and I slept in 2 hours past. When I woke up I immediately called my manager and I was frantic on the phone,  I told him what time he could expect me to walk in, but he said not to worry about it, and that we all do it sometimes...he said he wasn't going to write me up because I had never done anything like this before, and I have worked at this mcdonalds for a long time now. I really hope they don't start cutting my hours back because of this. I feel so bad, like I let my coworkers down. I just kept apologizing on the phone but he just said that I didn't have to come in at all, it was only a four hour shift after all, and coming in to do an hour and a half of work seemed pointless. Idk I just feel so bad, has this happened to any of you before? How did your boss react?"
none,"Hey everyone, I am new to this whole crystal healing thing. I have a few questions if you all wouldn't mind. Alright so the first thing is, I am also Christian and I wholeheartedly believe in god and his righteousness, and I just really like crystal healing. In fact, I don't just like crystal healing, I also really like things like smudge and sage, stuff in that category. I just don't know why I am feeling kind of sad about taking a liking to these things because everyone just judges me and think I'm a freak, when really I just want inner peace for myself. I don't believe that chakra and crystal healing is witchcraft but everyone seems to think so. It's just really getting me down lately. I mean, for instance I was talking to one of my friends today, and long story short is this: she asked me what I did that day and I said ""oh well I bought a new crystal!""and she wanted to know what I do with them and So obviously I told her that you must cleanse a crystal when you first get it, than charge it. Well, she said this in the most disgusted voice ever: ""um, so you believe in that stuff?."" And I was like yeah. But ever since that conversation I'm feeling pretty bad about myself.If any of you guys and gals out there have any advice , please do not hesitate to borrow me some. Thank you❤️"
none,As the title states . I'm physically an overwheight guy . And my therapist (whom I could not afford anymore) told me about the concept of authentic self and loving myself beyond the physical . The problem is some days I think about improving my body and other days I just tell myself that I need to love myself as I am and be happy . And the uncertainty is making both impossible because whenever I find the motivation to do either the other immediately enters my mind . What should I do ?
none,Hello fellow wastelanders . I have been doing breach and clear for about a month and it's a great way to gather ore for ammo crafting.  but since the last update the lights on the individual containers have been bugged .The way they're supposed to work is the containers that have been unsealed have their lights switch off when they're cleared out . This is very helpful as you can know which containers to check when the next unloading happens . But since the last update as soon as the lode breaches all the containers have their lights on and they don't switch off when you empty them

none,"Hello everyone , I've noticed that ever since I was young music has been my escape from reality and I never get tired of it . But when I watch a music video around 4 or 5 times emerges a single shot , it doesn't have to be singnificant or anything it could be a backup dancer or the singer singing for 3 seconds but that single shot stays with me and from there on out everytime I watch that music video I anticipate that single shot and often get a strange feeling and sometimes even goosepumps , this happens even if it had been years since I've seen it . I don't know what this is or if anyone else feels it or am I alone (and somewhat creepy i think) in this regard ."
none,"Hello everyone , I needed some advice on my working condition . Buckle down because this is a wild ride I graduated in January 2019 and found a job at around july which was great timing considering job opportunities were and still are scarce . The job I found paid more than the market and was more than I had expected so I took it , it turns out everyone on staff is amazing except for the company's owner . He is one of the worst people I've ever met . What he does is pressure his employees more and more everyday with extra responsibilities until they snap , when they do he lays off of them for a week or so and then starts again . Working at this job has been a wild ride of depression and anxiety every day and mini heart attacks when he calls me to yell at some trivial thing for half an hour like the asshole he is . Every employee is working as much as 4 or 5 people at the expense of their mental and physical health and their personal time , when I was working I was working 12 hours a day 6 days a week and not answering your work phone even outside of working hours is banned at the company and he will punish you if you're not available to talk all the time at his convenience. The actual place of the work is a series of villages about 90 minutes away by car and I can't move because I'm living with my parents so I can't leave them and I can't really support myself and live alone at the same time . At the beginning of the pandemic he gave an open vacation without pay to half the management and I was one of them but now my direct boss is telling me to go back to work because they need me and because I need money . The problem is he if I come back he will order me to move to one of the villages since partial quarantine means I can only work for about 3 hours a day when subtracting my commute , but living at them is absolutely hell getting a furnished apartment is really expensive and they're usually in a bad state and very dirty . And getting an unfinished apartment and buying furniture is going to doom my savings into hell and it guarantees that I will almost never be able to look or find another opportunity and I will be stuck there . And if 24 quarantine starts I will be stuck there until the pandemic is over (by all expectations 3 or 4 months) . So even though going back to work is the obvious choice here since I'm lucky to even hold a job right now the amount of anxiety I'm feeling every time I think about going back and thinking about moving away and leaving my elderly parents alone is not making the decision any easier .What should I do , shouls I go back and potentially lose all my savings since he will not give me a penny to relocate or should I stay and ride out this pandemic without pay and then go back if he will take me back ?"
none,"Hello everyone I recently got a second hand s4 44mm but I'm having an issue with the digital crown.It scrolls and clicks fine but sometimes when I'm in an app and I click it , it doesn't bring me to the app grid but instead goes directly to the watchface .

My responsibilities are : Supervising and coordinating sites Coordination of materials and equipment Municipality work (securing contractor payouts and stuff) A bit of quantity surveying I am usually doing this for about 3 sites in 2 different projects at once so I don't know what role do I play in this company as even they do not .I am looking to go to a bigger company soon and I need to know what to tell them when they ask about what my role was in my previous job   ."
none,"Hello . This is a road that we were paving on top of an old road when rainfall started , I recommended that we stop but that would mean the rest of the asphalt (around 2 full trucks with 22 tons each) was going to get thrown away , but the project manager refused citing that it would be a loss . So we continued and the next day we found the asphalt like this , how can I go about fixing it and how can I prevent a situation like this in the future ? https://imgur.com/a/w3ZKLmH"

I do not belong in any kind of group and this has really brought me down the last few days . How do I go about finding something that I am passionate about and try and belong to some kind of like minded group ?"

none,"Hello everyone , the Samsung members app is really getting on my nerves , my phone was originally bought in saudi arabia and it was factory unlocked , now I've moved to Cyprus and the samsung members app chooses language based on the SIM card that is active . So now I have Samsung members in a language I don't understand with a beta program that doesn't apply to my device (since my firmware is KSA ) and no way to sign up or access the original Samsung members that is actually relevant to me . Can I do anything about this ? "

none,Every time I download a video or a GIF it downloads but it seems to be corrupted as when I try to play it it only displays a black screen and it doesn't play . This has been going on since the beginning and every changelog I look for a fix but it hasn't been fixed yet.
none,"Hey everyone . I got [this dopp bag](https://www.ebay.com/p/Ben-Sherman-Luggage-Mayfair-Grainy-PVC-Top-Zip-Single-Compartment-Travel-Kit/17019679199?iid=123232027655) as a gift , and I don't really need one since I don't travel much .I was thinking about using it everyday for storing my phone (doesn't fit in my pocket) a wallet and a power bank and a few other things so I don't have to carry them in my pocket. should I do it ?"

none,"Hey , I've been having a couple problems and I thought they were going to be fixed in the latest update but they weren't . 1- a lot of the time when I first open the app I get a couldn't connect to reddit error message and I need to retry a couple times to get it working , even though tge ""other apps"" never had this problem 2-90% of the voting button is dedicated to upvoting , which means that downvoting is a nightmare for someone like me with giant fingers .This is actually more of a suggestion because it would get me consistently using this app without even thinking about it . The ability to block certain subs, I like to browse r/all but a couple subs really do spam r/all and I like to block them , which is possible on all the other apps except on  the official one. Which doesn't make any sense . Thank you"
none,"Hey guys , so recently I bought an **HP Pavilion 15-au101nx**Specs : intel i7 7500U Nvidia geforce 940MX 12 GB ramInitially I was gaming on it with no problem , but under heavy games it was getting really hot and the coolers didn't help .so I undervolted the CPU by **-81 mV** which limited the heat but didn't make much of a difference . (*CPU temperature used to get around 95 I got 92/3*)So I asked for help and I got 2 answers :1- Disable turbo boost (my CPU goes from **2.90** to **3.5** Ghz with turbo boost) I tried this and made a stress test got a temperature of *72 C* which was amazing .2-Someone else told me that limiting the maximum CPU frequency to something like **3.2**Ghz and and adjust it according to the temperatures I get would be much better than disabling turbo boost altogether . I don't know which is better overall and which I should do ?thanks ."

none,In today's video I heard him talk about how he had his face scan for codemasters. I know there is the mechanic who looks very similar to him but I thought that was just a coincidence. Is that actually Ben in the game from his face scans? How long ago did they do this if so. Also Aarava has a similar looking character to him so was he also scanned and put into the game?
none,Hi. I know F1 made a deal with a studio a few years ago about making an only management F1 video game. Does anyone know the studio and how progress is going on the game? Thanks.
none,Marking as a spoiler just to be safe. Everyone seems to want dark oak wood and now it seems many lifers(players) have access to it. Why does everyone want it so bad? I thought the only reason for dark oak wood was asteticts.
none,Hello. I just bought this game. I got the steam key and it installed. Now whenever I click play it opens the game in a window with a black screen then instantly closes back down. It's only happening to this game. I would love any help! Thanks.
none,Hi. So I was reading through a post and saw a comment and tried to report it for someone considering self-harm and was going to select the reach-out to them option. When I tried to report it I think my screen froze and I couldn't select the option to report. I reloaded the page and once It reloaded I mistakenly reported the comment below which was replying to the one I wanted to report for considering self-harm. I immediately realized my mistake after submitting the report and felt bad seeing as the reply was trying to help and they posted some resources for the user. Is there anything I can do to fix this and can I get in trouble for reporting the wrong comment?Edit: Just realized the title should say comment not post
none,"Hi so I was trying to change my Google profile picture on my computer today and then noticed in your photos there was a photo marked ""Photos from your IPhone"" I clicked it and saw all my IPhone photos have uploaded and saved into google photos.The only time I've ever used Google Photos was 2 years ago to view photos shared with me, so I guess when I gave permission to access my camera roll, all my photos taken from my Iphone then became automaticly saved to Google photos?I'm just wondering how I can disconnect this, so my IPhone photos don't save in Google Photos. Also how I can delete all my Iphone photos from Google Photos without losing them on my Apple IPhone photos app?TLDR; How can I stop photos taken on my IPhone to save in my Google Photos?"

none,"I think meeting Hamish, going into Larson's house, the EPC and southwark incinerator, and SIRS chapter were the standouts from the main storyline. What do you guys think?"
none,"Hello. So I watched the first season and really liked the show. I love the cast, especially Seth and Hannah. I'm on the 5th episode of the 2nd season and wow the 2nd season is really bad. Just wondering if the end of the 2nd season or 3rd season are any good to watch? Can I skip ahead to a part in the 2nd season or do I need to watch the whole show to understand missed episodes?"
none,"This is my first year following the nuggets. I know Bol Bol is a fan favorite, but just from his play he doesn't seem very good. The nuggets have better rookies and it doesn't seem he's needed. I know this is very unpopular but is his dad the only reason he gets so much attention?"
none,"I mean it would be a unique season finale and relate back to the early show. Plus we never see the shelter much, so this may be it's use?"
none,"So I know this has probably all been said, but I just want to share my thoughts.So my theory is one of the main ideas is going to be with Manila. She's awesome and is entertaining. The hostages and Arurito still have that phone and can contact the outside world. I think a big part of the plot is going to involve the phone.This is a really unprobabole crazy guess, but is there a chance of a mole? Halfway through S4, around episode 4-5, it seemed there was a small idea Rio was a mole. I know it almost 100% won't happen and wouldn't make sense, but do we think there is any chance the gang has a mole? Let me know what you think?"

none,"Look I really like Mr.Beast and I think most of his videos are real. However this one was so obviously fake it wasn't even good. It was very clear one, there aren't meals this expensive especially in if you're not in a place like New York or LA or London which they weren't. Second, they would have actually talked about the restaurant they were and and given the chef a promo or say there name. I'm not sure if people just don't care, this was far too fake."
none,"Hi I'm on season 5 right now. So I really love the show and Garret was a good character (not the best) from seasons 1-3. Now all of a sudden I noticed in the first 3/4ths of season 4 he has completely changed. He isn't very funny anymore and IMO is just a really mean person and his friendship with Jonah is meh now. It's gonna a little better at the start of season 5, but did anyone else notice a change for him?"
none,"So it has been around 4 months since Legion came out. Personally, I think it's a great game, with a few issues, not the best storyline as the main one. The game definitely tried something new, but I am wondering if it was successful. To me when it was first announced it was received well and had many gamers and people looking forward to it. However, I think the delay definitely hurt the game and a fair amount of interest was lost. When it came out it got good reviews and I think it was unfortunate it didn't get the attention the game deserved. The game price is fair, but I am also not sure if it has sold 5+ million copies even, so I just don't know if the game is considered a flop and if so why?TLDR: **So what I am asking is do you think the game was a flop and if so why?** **Do we think there will be a future WD4 and will it go back to the WD2 path or stay on the Legion path?**Let me know what you think!"

none,"Hey thanks for reading and maybe answering these1. So when I am in a Albion, clan Kelley restricted area and get caught if I flee or just stand there what will happen?2. If you start fighting with Clan Kelley, or the police will they pull a gun at some point and if they win the fight are you just critically injured? (Also is there a difference for this being in a restricted area or not)3. If I am in a dire situation is it okay to kill people in a rush wether this be fleeing or running for life in the game or will this impact me later on?

none,I'm surprised how many people dislike this season? What are your reasons?I liked it because I thought the drama with the cast was good but not too much and the route was awesome. Did anyone else like the season?
none,"Hello. I became a hermitcraft fan mid season 6. I watched 7, but around the election I lost interest and haven't watched sense Scar one. I primarily watched Keralis, Grian, Iskall, Stressmonster and sometimes Scar, Impulse Bdubs and Mumbo. Honestly I got really annoyed with Mumbo and how's he's very childish and I just found him annoying early-mid season 7. Anyways I am just wondering what's going on, if I should come back, and if so should I just jump in or start from where I left off. Thanks.Edit: I also kind of found the shopping district boring around the point I left (scar election) and how there was little interaction in it."
none,Freshman here. We finished our XC season last month. Of course COVID completely changed it but my fastest time was 20:45. I was near the top of JV for our team but is this a good/fine time considering I didn't really train for the summer. My goal is too run around 20 min 5k next year so with winter/summer/spring training is this achievable?

none,"Hello. I am a freshman and choose LD for this year. So far I don't really like LD, because it is too formal,  and it is hard to actually debate a specific topic. It feels very unpredictable with judging and opponents, but this may just be high school debate in general. I feel like I'm giving a speech and the arguments made on debate don't even have to always be super strong and thoughtful. What debate topic do you think I should switch to? (I know most answers will be PF, but please say them anyway."
none,"First I just want to say this is my opinion, if you disagree reply below. I'm sorry guys, but  Kaylynn and Haley would have never of made the finals. From the first episode, they were a team I didn't love or dislike, they were good, but nothing special. Now if we look at the data, the only had one leg with a top 3 finish and there next closest was 5th. Even before the alliance, they had gotten 8th twice, bottom 4th of the race. The alliance hurt them even more, but we look at their luck too they were very lucky and they never were close enough to the top teams. Plus there average finish result was lower than M&V and Leo and Alana. Anyways, lets hope the rest of the season can finish strong."
none,"I know the alliance technically has 5 teams, but we never really see Eswar & Aparna racing or involved in the alliance. There gap to the front is just too large to be fully immersed."

none,"Hi. I'm a mid sized fan of TAR and have watched everything from S22 to now (S32). I have introduced a few people to TAR and had them watch Season 25 and one time 28 which was a bad choice considering they quit watching midway through and it's an ehh season. I think season 25 is a good season considering it is good route, tasks, and casting and a newer season. What seasons do you think are the best to introduce to new potential TAR fans?"

However, after watching episode 1 of the 3rd season I'm not to sure it will be good, therefore I can see why they cancelled the show. Why did ABC make a drastic change in the show for season 3 and I saw it is 13 episodes, so did they shorten the season once they realized it was bad?"
none,"Out of all the 2020 season races, which one's either confirmed or not confirmed for future seasons do you want to see stay in F1 for a long time. I would love to see Portimao, but it would need slight changes like a shorter DRS zone."

none,"So nick de vries won the F2 2019 Chamiponship. He didn't get a F1 seat and can't race in F2 anymore. Does this mean all his chances at a F1 seat are forever lost, just because the year he won F2, F1 seats were not open. It seems really sad and unfair a guy who wins the chaimonship won't ever get a shot at F1 and will have to race in other series. Now I don't know much about F2, so 2019 could have also just been an easy year."
none,"If I am correct there aren't any videos on the logistics or how cruise ships, cargo ships, or yachts work.We could also see a video on the logistics of a mega resort. This leads into my second idea on a video on Vegas casinos and hotels and how they are so big, function, and attract people."

It's with the greatest sorrow I inform you all of this. Last night, I was informed that not only a colleague but also a friend of ours, [u/git-commit-die](https://www.reddit.com/u/git-commit-die/), has passed away.

He was a very influential part of the community, even before his time as a moderator. A lot of us knew him as a friendly and kind person with a brilliant mind - his commitment to this community was something I've seen only a handful of times. This subreddit couldn't be what it is today without his contributions.

I live in Dubai , I do not know what the age of consent is here , one page on google said it is illegal to have sex before marriage ( pretty dumb ) and once says below 16 , So I do not know what I did was legal or not but fuck it , it was worth it .Now things I would love to ask ,  1. how do I discard condom discreetly ? I took the used one and dig it under the burj park , it was early morning and not a lot of people were there and no one saw me lol but I do not wanna hid it and bury it in a park , I do not want to be fined 1000s of dirhams . the public bin stand has a lot of people walking around it and I do not want them to know anything as most of them are my parent's neighbors .2. Should she take the pill ? I mean I did not nut inside her and took it out before ejaculating ( was wearing a condom too ) but I wanna know because we use lube and it can reduce friction and all you know , so should she if we have it again and I nut inside ( while wearing condom ) is the pill safe ? ( was not taught in school )3. We need less moaning , how do we do that , I was gentle last night and I do not want her brother hearing us at night or her parents , ( her dad is scary )4. should I tell my dad about it ? I do not want my mom to know tho (mommy issues) but my dad loves her (idk why) and I think it will be a burden on him to not tell her .5. fuck I talk to her about ? we had sex , cleaned ourselves and took bath and cuddled and slept , woke up early and had to discard the condom and go to the park ( I sneak at night and go to park in morning so my parents won't know I was at her pent and I do not know what to talk about after sex with her .thanks for reading a teen's bullshit and do not mind to give me some advises a person should know !!!"

none,"Heres a little story that involves a broken finger,blood and of course my mom not using a basic thing called logic.So my mom considers herself a very logical person keyword considered. One day we went to a thrift store and my mom wanted me a brain dead six year old who was still learning how to read to take care of my brother. And we went to a section where there where dumbbells and bikes and shit of course we get a dumbell and we start using them and when my brother used it of course broke his finger and my mom heard the crying and saw and there was blood on his finger and of course me being there and my mom being a idiot said why didnt you take care of him.I was a fucking six year old and didnt know shit about life and you may be thinking well your the only  older sibling right? Wrong. I had a older sister who was 11 at the time and so It would be more logical to get the older sibling to take care of the 4 and 6 year old. But at the same time you shouldnt expect kids to do the parenting but my mom goes balistic and yells at me and of course I cry we leave the store and go to the hospital he gets a finger cast you would think its the end of it but no she keeps going on and on about how I cant do anything right and how my dad and her where gonna take away my toys but they never did because my dad. Didnt give a shit about her rambling about me not taking care of him.And to this day my mom still hasnt goten the Grasp of common sense.

none,"I am going to cut straight to the case.I am not a perfect writer who has written a timeless classic and is being mistreated by the evil publishing companies. No. I am a 19 year old Serbian student who wrote his first novel in English language after 15 years of writing various school articles and small-time online blogs. I have sent my book to an editor online and he has returned a copy of the book with ""fully correct grammar and better phrased sentences"" to quote his own words. I have an e-mail to hundreds of publishing companies, both smaller, local ones and the ones everyone has heard of. As you guessed, I have gotten absolutely no reply, even after emailing them all once a week for about a month (Andy Dufresne style).Now, I am considering the self-publishing option. I have never cared about money in my life and I am willing to pay all I have to get this novel published, even if I don't get a single dime back, but I just want it done. However, I am literally unable to ""get to"" the US and know no one there, and was wandering, if and how I am able to self-publish my book remotely?"

none,"Hi everyone. I have a 15/16 year old chinchilla who seems to be struggling with jumping as of late. (It's worth noting one of his back feet was amputated years ago, before I got him due to an injury)He's fallen over a few times when getting in and out of his cage, and whilst he normally stays in the top half of his cage (it's a critternation Midwest 2 story style cage) he's been spending more and more time in the bottom, and I'm curious if this is due to his inability to jump up to the top level. He's my first chin and I adopted him when he was around 10 from a friend who was moving and couldn't take pets with her. I just want to ensure he's safe, and not likely to injure himself, but still be happy. Any recommendations?"

In my opinion, as long as the shop isn't advertising their shop directly in the image/comments then I'm  happy for them to share their wares, and it keeps the sub flowing.

Please read the T&C's before entering each competition**# Tips & Tricks* **Dodge the inevitable spam** Let's be frank – companies usually set up competitions to get your email, number and other personal details. So take steps to avoid being deluged with marketing bumf. **Set up a dedicated email address.** Never use your normal email address. It'll be immediately flooded with spam. Instead, set up a dedicated email account.* **Be picky about the competitions you enter** It may sound obvious, but focus your time on entering contests with goodies you actually want to win.* **Filter winning emails**  These emails often feature the words 'congratulations', 'won' or 'winner', so automatically move messages with these words in the body or subject line into a competition wins folder.* **Keep tabs on prizes** It's worth keeping a list of prizes you've won, in case they don't materialise. Usually promoters are not purposely withholding the goodies – they just need a little nudge now and again.* **Be wary of 'free' holidays**  A common timeshare company ruse is to say you've won a totally free, no-strings-attached holiday... but first you need to listen to a presentation. These are best avoided.* **Avoid pay-to-enter competitions**  Most contests are for promotional purposes. Those that require fees are essentially lotteries and gambling. While the cost of a stamp's fine, beware this takes away from any winnings.For further tips and tricks please visit my inspirations for this post [Money Saving Expert](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/Competitions-comping-win/) and [Super Lucky](https://superlucky.me/)"

none,"So this is a few years ago. Around 5 or so maybe? I was on various internet dating sites, and began chatting to a chap we shall call Dave. So Dave was lovely via conversation - interesting, interested, similar likes and dislikes and a friend in common. He had himself together, rented his own place and seemed pretty much set up for life (he was around 5 years old than me too) Good foundation for a a potential first date! So we decided to make it casual meeting at a pub and see how it went. Well date 1 was great, we went from the pub to have a meal and planned date 2. At this point not one red flag.Date 2 is where things took a turn. We had planned to go to the cinema but missed the showing, so I head and meet at his house. We sit and chat (so well so far) I end up speaking about an ex a lot (yes I know... My bad, but it wasn't like that. Said ex was a great friend and still is to this day) Dave told me he was concerned I wasn't over ex and didn't want to *take advantage of me* (emphasised for note for later!) I told him not to worry ex was a friend and shouldn't have been a relationship at all. Dave kept saying things similar to not taking advantage, not wanting to move too fast, he said I wasn't ready yet etc. I started to get tiny warning bells but nothing concerning. Just baffled. A little while later Dave and I were cuddling and kissing on the sofa.. he asked if we could have sex, to which I told him no. He accepted my rejection, but kept bringing up how it has been long time.. a very long time. More chat and more don't want to take advantage comments spilled from his lips (ugh)Eventually we ended up kissing on the sofa, he was on top of me, and it was nice.. until he started grinding against me telling me it had been a while.. me being who I am as a person wanted to see how far his ""don't want to take advantage"" after my rejection of sex would go. His grinding turned into humping (no kisses now, his face was over my shoulder grunting whilst he dry humped me) Now this is bad, no? I wanted to see if he would try have sex with me, so waited it out, checked my watch several times, and came to the realisation that this... *This* is definitely what a teddy feels like when a dog is in heat.Eventually he finished (by finished I mean finished. He came in his jeans) and fell asleep next to me (Wtf?!) So I was stuck between a man and the back of the sofa. I texted friends explaining about what had happened and that i was ready to leave, and tried to wake him. He finally woke up and went to go get changed. Whilst he was getting changed I collected my things together and told him I was leaving. I asked him where my shoes were (he had put them away at the start of the night) and he snapped at me and told me I have to sort them out myself (I wasn't asking him to put my shoes on for me)I left Dave's and never looked back. He messaged a couple of days later telling me he thinks we should be friends (you what mate?!...)I ghosted him and moved on with my life. Was that the last time I heard from him? No... No it wasn't. He then 12+ months on tried messaging again on said dating site we originally met on. Still get mocked to this day by my friends!"

I know he's had a cage buddy in the past, but the first friend passed away and i believe he had a second friend but they fell out and now he's alone (I adopted him around October last year from  a friend who couldn't take him to her new house). I have no space for a second cage in my house, so I'm looking for advice if it would be possible to do or not? I'd be looking to rescue an older relaxed chin to compliment Jazz's personality and ability as Jazz has a stump rather than a full foot – obviously I won't get him a friend if this isn't the best idea, but just looking for advice. if it helps I have a midwest critter nation model 162."
none,"Hi guys, I've noticed recently that my chin has bald patches around his legs (front and back) and his tummy. I adopted him a few months back but didn't notice them at the time so they could be new? At a recent full clean I entirely moved his cage around to try shake it up a little and keep it exciting but feel maybe this contributed (this is when I noticed the patches) so moved it back to previous layout. He has tubes toys things to climb and knaw loads of hiding spaces etc.. so not sure why he's doing it. Any advice please?"
none,"Hi guys, looking for a bit of advice please. I have adopted a chin (a few months ago) from a friend who couldn't take him with her when she moved house. He's about 10 years old. He's my first chin too.I try have him out every day and sit with him for a while. He does however tend to have a run around the room once, and then go back into his cage to sit on a ledge staring at me. He likes to sit and peek from any ledge he can find. Is this a common occurrence?  I'm not sure if it's his age so he doesn't really want to play. All he wants is his cage doors open and any treats he can get his paws on. Any ideas if this is just his personality or if he's bored/lonely and I need to up my game? Thanks!"
none,"My chin has a little bit of matted fur on one side of his body. He arrived with the matts from the friend I adopted him from, so I'm looking for advise on how to fix the matts.

What would you suggest for the smaller ones, or just leave them? Thanks in advance!"
none,"Hi. Thank you for taking the time to read this. So last year (potentially earlier this year) I adopted a hamster from the local pet store - they have an adoption part for animals that don't get picked and are too old, have been bullied by others and had to be separated or donated by customers for a variety of reasons. (pets at home, UK). I'm not sure of his age but he's a Russian dwarf, maybe around 12 months. He has always been an extremely territorial hamster, and when my other dwarf passed I moved him into the bigger cage. He managed to one day get his leg caught between the bars and started knawing his leg off. Thankfully managed to rescue him and swap him back to th smaller cage. When picking him up to clean his paw with salt water he broke free of my grip and jumped to the floor (around kitchen counter hight to the floor ) I thought he was dead but he moved a short time later, so picked him up, put him in his cage and kept an eye on him. Over 2/3 weeks I saw he was back to normal (no longer letting me stroke him etc) so I put him back on normal bedding and toys in his cage. Almost overnight he went from a bitey little thing to acting like he had a twitch. He puts his head in the air and sways side to side, runs in circles and seems to lack balance. He's been like this a week, but doesn't seem in pain or bothered by it. Still eats and drinks fine, but has stopped trying to bite me. Any ideas of what it could be? I'm just hoping he will be okay for a little while as I doubt I can afford even the check up fees this month at the vets. Any advice would be great. Thank you!"

Me and my partner moved into a 3 unit apartment a few months back, we are the basement apartment and the ones we are having problems with are the middle floor we will refer to them as J and B. Above them is 1 other tenant that has been here for 20+ years his name is Josh and he's really sweet but he has some mental issues after being in a bad car accident. So here's the problem.....Ever sens we have moved in they have been nothing but horible people, we have called the cops numerous times and our landlord is trying to evict them for not paying rent but due to covid things are taking an extra long time. We have what is supposed to be a SHARED back yard, which they have now completely taken over! They were told by out landlord they were not allowed to put anything up without speaking to him first and making sure it was okay with the other tenants, I would like to share pictures to show you what all they have done. They built a wooden canopy lounge area, a fire pit, a set of outdoor furniture, a mini pool for there kids, a mini trampoline, a tree house, a swing set and a barabque plus more! Idk what to do they have completely taken over and we have complained as well as the tenants up stairs but j and b get away with everything! I tried putting up wind chimes to anoy them maybe but nothing is working! All I want to do is be able to sit in my own back yard and enjoy the sun on a hit day! I'm tired of feeling trapped in my apartment all the time. Not only has B made me feel not safe with his numerous threats to hurt me and the cops refusing to do anything, but he is constantly screaming at his wife and step kids... his wife if currently pregnant with there 5th kid!

Something that I sort of stress on is that I'm very sexual but I gradually want to talk and do that stuff with someone after I've gotten to know them since I really don't feel comfortable when doing that immediately or after a couple of days.[.](https://imgur.com/a/ZAP7wPY)To begin with, my little age ranges from around 4-8. I love love love pacis, stuffies and cuddles 🥰. I love being in my little space but I'm not getting back into finding my little self again because for awhile I stopped being and feeling like me and very little so I'd like and prefer someone who would help me be little and not stop me from being little and myself. Since I've dealt with some who don't want me to be little and made me stop being and feeling my little self. Onesies are super duper amazing I love them even though I have only one. 🥺🥺But I have lots of baggy clothes which I also love since they make me feel super small and little I love them ☺️💕 i just love cutesy clothes and dark clothes too since I have many aesthetics that there are too many to choose from. I also absolutely love to ramble especially right now. I'm a sweet loving little who loves sweets I've got the biggest sweetest tooth ever!  but sometimes I can be bratty sometimes even when I don't wanna be. Mainly because I need sleep, food or just some good loving. I'm a very sleepy person so sometimes I don't respond even though I'm clingy it's because I'm out like a light or if I suddenly stop talking I'm probably drifting to sleep. ⚠️Warning⚠️: I require so much attention it's crazy! I'm super duper clingy and needy and love attention and affection and if I don't get it I'm a big brat so if you want to get me you need to heed my warning!For the person who would like to hopefully like to write to me. I hope you're ready for a bunch of anime/manga recommendations as well as horror movies I love to watch! I'm most likely to want to watch a bunch of horror movies either in person or via video call. (I don't mind distance for how far a person can be.) Please be into cgl and age play because I feel it's a need for me. I'm fine with someone of any height or age but I usually prefer people older but I'm not opposed to someone closer to my age. You must be able to give hugs, cuddles and affection! I'm fine with any distance whether close or far and please please be monogamous since I'm not into polygamy sorry. I do respect those who love that but I know it's definitely not for me. Please be very nice and caring but also sometimes I need discipline and be put in my place a bit more often than I tell myself I don't. If you do have a deep voice or nice hands or veiny hands and forearms, I think I'd fall for you a bit too easily but this isn't a requirement to date me I just I like it.  I have so much more to me than just this. If you wanna know more please send me a chat/message I'd be grateful to get one from you. Hope to chat with you soon 💕💕P.S. I have an album of my pics/videos hidden within this post! This time I made it a bit easier than before anddddd I have a pic of my pup at the end of the album "
none,"hiii💕, just to clarify I'm pansexual but I'm seriously looking for friends rn and if it turns or develops into something more then a relationship. Also that I'm okay with people of any age. If you don't know what pansexual means it means I love everyone of any gender but I really base you on your personality and what you're like as a person. So if you like to be rude and try to get me to send even though I don't know you I already don't like you, and much more like that. So you get the jist that I don't like rude people lol. You also might wanna know about me. I'm 5'2” sooo I'm pretty short. I am a curvy person who's still average but very curvy. I'm a mixed baby but I mainly look African American instead of Caucasian. So you probably aren't into that so I might as well say that right now. I have dark brown eyes, one dimple and my natural hair color is black but I bleached and dyed my hair so right now it's a blob dish brown that's really curly right now. Also I love drawing, reading manga and normal books, watching anime, dancing sometimes. Singing to myself when I'm alone (I'm super shy), playing my violin, spending time with family and friends. Loving my pets, sleeping and eating and more. I love ranting about my lovely doggies and love showing pics of my drawings so ask away if you wanna see . I'm fairly shy and an ambivert.

I love being in my little space but I'm not getting back into finding my little self again because for awhile I stopped being and feeling like me and very little so I'd like and prefer someone who would help me be little and not stop me from being little and myself. Since I've dealt with some who don't want me to be little and made me stop being and feeling my little self. Onesies are super duper amazing I love them even though I have only one. 🥺🥺But I have lots of baggy clothes which I also love since they make me feel super small and little I love them ☺️💕 i just love cutesy clothes and dark clothes too since I have many aesthetics that there are too many to choose from. I also absolutely love to ramble especially right now. I'm a sweet loving little who loves sweets I've got the biggest sweetest tooth ever!  but sometimes I can be bratty sometimes even when I don't wanna be. Mainly because I need sleep, food or just some good loving. I'm a very sleepy person so sometimes I don't respond even though I'm clingy it's because I'm out like a light or if I suddenly stop talking I'm probably drifting to sleep. ⚠️Warning⚠️: I require so much attention it's crazy! I'm super duper clingy and needy and love attention and affection and if I don't get it I'm a big brat so if you want to get me you need to heed my warning!For the person who would like to hopefully like to write to me. I hope you're ready for a bunch of anime/manga recommendations as well as horror movies I love to watch! I'm most likely to want to watch a bunch of horror movies either in person or via video call. (I don't mind distance for how far a person can be.) Please be into cgl and age play because I feel it's a need for me. I'm fine with someone of any height or age but I usually prefer people older but I'm not opposed to someone closer to my age. You must be able to give hugs, cuddles and affection! I'm fine with any distance whether close or far and please please be monogamous since I'm not into polygamy sorry. I do respect those who love that but I know it's definitely not for me. Please be very nice and caring but also sometimes I need discipline and be put in my place a bit more often than I tell myself I don't. If you do have a deep voice or nice hands or veiny hands and forearms, I think I'd fall for you a bit too easily but this isn't a requirement to date me I just I like it.  I have so much more to me than just this. If you wanna know more please send me a chat/message I'd be grateful to get one from you. Hope to chat with you soon 💕💕P.S. I have an album of my pics/videos hidden within some of my other posts! "
none,"Note: First, I'd like to note that I'm a little. Yes, I am submissive but I don't want to be a slave, or your slut or your pet. I would like a caregiver or friends who are subs or littles like me or doms and dommes alike. Also please don't ask about being a third or just for dirty stuff too, I don't do that I'm looking for a relationshipHii lovelies, just to clarify I'm pansexual but I'm seriously looking for friends rn and if it turns or develops into something more then a relationship. Also that I'm okay with people of any age. If you don't know what pansexual means it means I love everyone of any gender but I really base you on your personality and what you're like as a person. So if you like to be rude and try to get me to send even though I don't know you I already don't like you, and much more like that. So you get the jist that I don't like rude people lol. You also might wanna know about me. I'm 5'2” soo I'm pretty short. I am a curvy person who's still average but very curvy. I'm a mixed baby but I mainly look African American instead of Caucasian. So you probably aren't into that so I might as well say that right now. I have dark brown eyes, one dimple and my natural hair color is black but I bleached and dyed my hair so right now it's a blob dish brown that's really curly right now. Also I love drawing, reading manga and normal books, watching anime, dancing sometimes. Singing to myself when I'm alone (I'm super shy), playing my violin, spending time with family and friends. Loving my pets, sleeping and eating and more. I love ranting about my lovely doggies and love showing pics of my drawings so ask away if you wanna see . I'm fairly shy and an ambivert. I tend to be more introverted when you know me but become like a crazy weird extrovert to only you when we get comfy with one another.

none,"Note: I know there aren't people who will do this in this sub but I know there are people who say they are a caregiver” but try to make me a slave so this is for them. First, I'd like to note that I'm a little. Yes, I am submissive but I don't want to be a slave, or your slut or your pet. I would like a caregiver or friends who are subs or littles like me or doms and dommes alike. Hii, as said in the title I'm just looking for someone to chat with. Since I'm stuck at home with my family and I would like to have someone to chat with and have fun with. I'm a natural indoors person too as well and an ambivert. I enjoy nature and the outdoors as well but I much prefer being inside away from a ton of people due to anxiety and stress. But in my free time I tend to play my violin and practice new pieces of music, listen to music, draw and paint with my siblings. As well as, write short stories, watch anime and read manga and jsut read and watch stuff in general, also I sing badly in the shower and dance horribly around the house, and much more!If you want to know or are curious to what I look like it's on my profile as I've posted myself previously to what I look like. You can if you want send me a picture of you but I'm not too picky about who I'm talking to as long as you're friendly since I'm just trying to make friends with people.

none,"So for the past couple of months I've been manifesting someone into my life, I'm just wondering if they're still coming and if they are will they be by chance my last love(I guess)? Next, I lost a necklace right before a shower about a month ago and I haven't seen it since. I had just received it that day it was a crystal i dont remember what crystal exactly but it was Moldavite I had bought. I wonder if it's a message my spirit is saying not yet and I won't get it back or find it until the right time I don't know. So if anybody could help me that would be wonderful and thank you in advance!Edit: I don't know if my spirit guides are just trying to reassure me or whatever but they also send me Angel numbers like every Angel number in the book while I'm on my phone and just going about my day in normal life as well."

none,"Here's a little info about me. I'm a very shy and introverted person but once you get to know me I'm very outgoing and loud and annoying at times and very boisterous. But overall I'm kind of creative in certain ways and weird too. I love to read, write, draw, play my violin, listen to music, sleep and eat and much more. I feel like I'm pretty boring so I'd like someone who could bring me out of my shell or someone I can relate to. I love anime and manga it's basically my life but I read normal books too I wish I read more of those but I don't. I'm looking to talk to anyone I don't really care about gender if anyone was wondering. I have so much more to talk about myself but you'll learn more about me as we talk. FYI, if wanna see a pic of me there's plenty that I've posted in the past. Also I live in Arizona the hottest place in the US people may argue otherwise but I feel like it's the hottest. But other than that if you're interested pm me.☺️"

none,I don't remember the year it was made but I remember listening to it in 2017 or 2016. It was this funny comedy sketch where someone was performing live on stage and it was recorded like a comedy performances they have on Netflix. It was a guy giving a scenario about if he was stranded on an island with I believe Channing Tatum or someone like that that he would wait about 100 days before trying to make advances on him. I guess. Then he later talks about how he performed in Texas a few years or months back and he talked about the sketch he told the audience and someone in the audience was shaking his head towards him and he thought it was because he thought it was a bad joke or something but the man told him he said he would wait about 30 or 40 days before actually doing it. But I don't remember the guy or the comedy special can someone help me find this comedy sketch
none,"Hi, I've been wondering for years now on finding this one thing and it's picture since it doesn't show pictures of this item anymore so I don't remember the name. I'm sorry if this probably isn't the best subreddit to find this but this is the only subreddit i can think of at the moment. It's a pancake that's probably been printed on with a cartoon character of some sort or something else and I think it could've been cut out into the shape of the cartoon. But it's from a long time ago it's not 3D printing from today and such or like how people will make pancakes to make it sort of look like the 3D printed pancakes. But I clearly remember this was something my parents bough often for my siblings and I when we were younger since my sister and I still remember it but can't find it at all. It usually was different cartoon characters but the most prominent character that we remember is spongebob and how great it tasted. I don't know if it was recalled and couldn't sell. But the brand could've highly likely been Eggos or another brand. I'm sorry I can't provide a picture or the best description of how the pancakes looked or anything but I really really wanna find these pancakes since they were sooo delicious and tasty. And we're designed perfectly for kids and hopefully we can find them."
none,Hi I'm looking for people to talk to as I'm bored and sick at home and need moral support for my ACT testing happening tomorrow. I'm stressing out and also tired.

And I have a bunch of other things to learn about me so hmu if you're interested. 
none,"Icy fingers gripped my arm in the darkness. I felt my stomach turn as I looked back to see my captor. The man had brown eyes like any normal man and his face was average but the thing that sent a chill up my spine was the wide smile he showed. It wasn't fair I still had a life to live and I didn't do anything wrong. I just went for a walk like I normally do in the mornings. He just wouldn't let go, after I felt his fingers his cold hands grip my arms to bring me closer to him. I feel like one of the stupid people in the horror movie who didn't know their life was coming to an end. He brought my face closer to his I had to shut my eyes so I didn't see the horrors that lie beneath his wicked smile. I could feel my knees weaken, my heart race faster than it's ever gone, and my stomach doing somersaults.   	I could feel his breath on my ear as he whispered, Why are you so scared it's not like I'm going to hurt you.” I knew at that moment I didn't want to lose my life I struggled at first but then I was able to kick him down.   \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  The police later found me and sent me to their interrogation room, kept questioning me over and over, I didn't respond. But, when they found me bashing his head over and over against the concrete they took me away all I could say as we left the crime scene was *It was self-defense. He attacked me, I only did what was right, right?*” They couldn't stand talking to me since no one could stay in the same room as me. I kept singing to myself with that cheeky smile knowing what I had done to my captor. ***He shouldn't have done that***”  "
none,"Here's a little info about me. I'm a very shy and introverted person but once you get to know me I'm very outgoing and loud and annoying at times and very boisterous. But overall I'm kind of creative in certain ways and weird too. I love to read, write, draw, play my violin, listen to music, sleep and eat and much more. I feel like I'm pretty boring so I'd like someone who could bring me out of my shell or someone I can relate to. I love anime and manga it's basically my life but I read normal books too I wish I read more of those but I don't. I'm looking to talk to anyone I don't really care about gender if anyone was wondering. I have so much more to talk about myself but you'll learn more about me as we talk. I have reddit (obviously), discord, hangouts and much more. I don't have Kik or messenger and please don't tell me to download it for you since I have no space and second it's annoying to hear that that is the only app you have. But other than that if you're interested pm me. ☺️"

none,"Hiiii, I'm a wittle girl but my daddy and I have a sort of long distance relationship but still in the same state. We visit every now and then and I wish we could more but I don't wanna bother him with that. So I'm happy with the days we do get to meet. But since we live apart it's hard he's busy 24/7 and likes to play games with his friends and family so I understand he needs personal time. But I feel like I get no more times with him. So he said it's fine if I can find either a mommy or daddy. For me since I don't care about gender and I'm not sure if I wanna ask for other people yet I'm thinking of taking it since we don't talk as much as we used to and he's fine with it. I'm not sure what to do at all anymore I'm just soooooooo confused by the situation entirely."

none,"Dear Person who will never be named,        I remember of a time I was happy. The person I admired and I were getting closer each day. Even when the conversations him and I had were short and sweet but also felt never ending. I still felt happy just speaking or talking to him. But I took too long to say the words I wanted to say for oh so long, I love you.” But instead I saw him drifting and finding another love and I couldn't stop him. Since I had so much time to say it but I didn't know how to say it or put my own emotions into words. So even after putting it all into thought and writing what had to say on a note and wanting to tell them they're my world, my everything. And putting it on a note and had to write on the back P.S. I think you like Molly now.” After conveying my feelings on the first two small pages. Then I tried to give it to him on the last day of school but I couldn't and I let my life and love fall right out of my hands. Everything is gone now and I can't turn back time to change how everything went down. But watch as their relationship grow bigger and bigger over time. I can't change the way I feel even if I say I hate him and can't forgive him. My heart just doesn't either and can't help but let me fall harder and hurt even more over time, and he never leaves my mind. And all I can do is let it happen and torture myself. Daydreaming of the times that could have been mine and think of a future that will never happen. All I do is write a story of something that will never come to be true in my mind. A story that could've been true but instead was a lie and I have to live with knowing the truth each day. Promising myself to not fall for him and to instead find another. But all these days of the past just keep reminding me I can never win in this story. I'm the bad guy and she's the hero who will always get the love interest. So I listen to music that makes me sad and isolate myself more than I did before from my friends and family. Days pass by slower than before and my heart crumbles every time I pass by him. I make myself seem happy by showing off a bigger smile than before and laughing way louder than before. I think every time in my head in the end he never loved her and will come running to me saying he was sorry for not knowing how I felt. Most people knew how I felt about him but I feel like he never knew or he did but never cared. Because every time we walk past each other he sees me as another person he never knew or did but never chooses to acknowledge my presence. When I think of you I wish I was holding your hand and you were holding mine. I wish I was the one by your side, I wish I could talk to you like old times. But even then would you really love me for who I am but fake it to make me feel better and still love another person who was not me. But I don't think you're wrong either I wouldn't want to date me either. I'm not pretty or popular, or skinny, or talkative or anything that would help you improve your image. I'm just another person who you don't see in your eyes anymore. I'm a weird, otaku, who's introverted, quiet, a nobody, and black. Who shouldn't be here anymore. Since i'm not perfect or talented or special or anything at all. It was all fun and games until you found her. The more I cared about you the more you cared about her and I lost more than I had before. You left and you don't care how much it hurts. Or how you left me hanging thinking we had something. But it was all nothing to you and you threw what I had given you into the trash along with my heart who can't trust another soul with my love. But slowly i'm forgetting all the memories. Even when after all this time when you weren't mine in the end or the beginning I still loved you till the end. Sincerely, Someone who was never and will never be yours"

none,"First some information you need to know before this story. I have been taken blood thinning medicine every morning since fourth grade, because of sickness that messed with a blood vessel in my heart. This story is happening in seventh grade. Also English isn't my first language so yeah.Cast:Me: MeF: FriendEM: My friends entitled step motherES: My friends entitled sisterM: My momI was at my friends house for a sleepover when the story happened. At the sleepover we just played video games and watched anime all night. Nothing special. The story really started in the morning at breakfast time. I took my pill from my bag and put it in my pocket. I usually take my pills by dissolving them in water or just washing them down with water. We sat down for breakfast and I took the pill from my pocket and dissolved it in a glass of water.EM then took the glass of waterMe: Excuse, can I get that glass of water back?EM: No! I know you were trying to do drugs in front of my little angel!Just saying her little angel” was playing on an iPad, not even looking.Me: you see that's actually a blood thinning pill, that I need to surviveF: He is telling the truthMy friend and his stepmother didn't have a good relationship. As you can see she calls the daughter her little angel, and my friend gets blamed every time the little angel” does something wrong.EM: I know a drug when I see one!The pills where heart shaped, not very drug like.Me: please can I just get the water?EM: No of course not! You have scarred my angel for life by showing her how to do drugs. You owe us.Me: What?! No, miss you don't understand it isn't even drugs.EM: Yes. It. Is!As she said this she poured the water into the sink. I started freaking out.Until now the sister seemed ok and not entitled but then the mom whispered something to her. Some info, I have a really nice gaming PC that I build with my dad.Now ES started walking towards my friends room. My pc was standing in there, but I didn't think anything of itMe: Why did you pour it out?!EM: no drugs for you.She then took out her phoneEM: now I'm gonna call your mom and tell her that you are taking drugs in my house! She smirkedThis actually made me happy. EM told my mom about the drugs and how I dissolved it in water. I figured she would understand what was going on. My mom hung up, and a few minutes later she arrived at my friends house.She began shouting at EM, about how i need those pills to live. My mom tells me to pack my stuff so we can leave.I walk into my friends room and see ES unplugging my pc. I quickly run over and shove her aside, and she runs out of the room. I pack my stuff and leave. Me and my friend are still friends, I haven't been at his house since that though. I came home quickly and got my medicine, so nothing happened.Edit: thanks for the rewards, kind strangers "

I could hear, smell, touch and taste, but I couldn't move.I felt something cutting my chest. My body filled with pain.I could feel the nurses poking around my lungs.Something went wrong and a flat line started to ring.Then, I couldn't feel anything. I could see a dim light in front of me.I walked towards it and saw a face, it was grim and pale. It was smiling from ear to ear.”Come closer, Garett.” It spoke.I stepped closer and one word slipped out of my mouth; Satanist.”I snapped back to reality and woke up in a hospital bed with my mother holding my hand and my father smiling at me.I knew what I saw that day.

The next time me and my sister, Ruby, visited her cottage to be greeted by a horrible stench.The smell was coming from the bathroom.The carpet around the bathroom was soaked and I begged Ruby to stay in the living room until I figured out where the smell was coming from.I opened the door and there was Nanny's corpse. She had skin peeling off her face and it smelled like rotten eggs and dead fish.  I screamed as the water from the bath kept flowing.I turned off the water and grabbed Nanny's telephone.”911, what's your emergency?””Hi, I would like to report a death.” I pinched my nose closed.”Who died, sweetie?” The operator asked.”My Nanny. Maya Goldberg. This is Tana Goldberg and I drove here with my sister, Ruby.””Are you joking?””No?...””Maya Goldberg died a week ago.” The operator sounded furious.”What?

Currently, I'm in my basement, documenting every single thing that is happening before my death.

My 24 year old wife, Jackie, is in the crawl space with our 6 year old son, Oliver. That is most assumed to be the safest place in the house.Wait a minute. Something just crashed upstairs. The doors are bolted shut. But that's not enough to stop them.It's now 5:32 am Eastern time. A window upstairs just broke. And I can hear footsteps and maybe faint growling?6:41 am. The growling was our dog, Delilah. She is down here with us and is acting quite strange. I can't blame her, though.It's now 7:00 am. The door to the basement his being pushed on from the outside. I might go up soon. I need to face these things before they hurt my family.7:12 am The door to the basement just broke down. There is a large creature with no face coming down the stairs.   7:32 am. I have my shotgun and I am ready to face this being. Whoever finds this, I wish you the best of luck. One last time, This is Dr. William Ryan Gray, From Madison Wisconsin, Signing off."
none,The house looked awfully similar to mine...
none,"It was a while ago, but I remember once I was babysitting these two kids. Their parents had went on a date at Outback Steakhouse and wanted me to watch these kids until 9:00 pm.So like usual, I put them to bed at 8:30 after their baths.The oldest looked at me and mumbled. You better watch out. Kiki doesn't like grown ups.”I looked behind me. Who's Kiki, Alan?”Kiki is the tall lady crying in the closet. See her?”At this point I thought the kid was toying with me so I said goodnight and went downstairs to enjoy that sweet free cable.But as I reached the bottom step I heard moaning coming from the living room.I tiptoed across the hall and peeked in to a good view of the couch.On the couch there was a tall, lanky woman sitting with her head in her lap.She had long black hair and she was naked.I shivered and ran up the stairs to get the kids out of the house.   When I was halfway up the stairs, I felt breathing on the back of my neck.”You should have listened to the kid.” A shrill voice growled in my ear.I turned my head around and there was the woman, smiling from ear to ear.Suddenly, the front door opened and she disappeared.I ran to the parents, they paid me, and I bolted from that house.   I moved to Utah after that. Never going back to Maine."
none,"(This story is NOT referenced to the pandemic. And I'm only posting this because my original story got no likes.)It was some years ago, but when I was in boarding school, There was this one student. She was a dork but she seemed popular, surprisingly. Time passed and eventually, we had a graduation. Now, the girl, (we'll call her Ashley) hadn't been at school for the last couple of weeks. Her parents took her home. Ashley would start having coughing fits in class and start vomiting once in a while. Anyways, at the graduation, Mellisa Hankhart, started turning pale.Are you ok?” I looked at her.”Yeah, I'm fine, simp.” She nudged me with her arm.But when she came up for her speech she coughed violently and vomited. Like Ashley.The teachers pulled her off the stage, then it was my turn.I walked up to the mic and grabbed my script.Suddenly, I froze. My stomach churned. And my forehead broke out in cold sweat.I ripped my script in half. And without thinking, I mumbled into the microphone;Don't turn around.” Then everything went blurry and black.I woke up under the bleachers.Under the bleachers, There lied Ashley and Mellisa.I gasped and looked at their lifeless faces.Black gunk was growing across Ashley's face, and starting to grow on Mellisa's.”Now, It's your turn.” A deep voice said behind me.Back at my parents house now. Two years later, everything is normal. Although, my mom has had black goo in her ear for a month now..."
none,"Passion Lin, a student at the University of Kentucky. Or WAS. I know I haven't made great choices ever... well, EVER. Especially in relationships. My name is ironic. It means love, lust, you know the shit. But the irony is, love is dead. And the sooner you know that, the better.I rolled over. It was cold in my boyfriend's queen-sized bed.The thunderstorm outside was the only thing keeping me awake.I glanced at the alarm clock. 2:34 am.I tried closing my eyes.The clock kept ticking and ticking and ticking... until it stopped.My boyfriend, asleep 5 minutes ago was standing over me, his Swiss Army knife was up to my throat.Juan, what are you doing?!” I choked.I'm sorry, darling.” He slit my throat.The pain was unbearable. Sharp ringing filled my ears, a warm, gushy and painful feeling surrounded me.Help!” I tried to squeak, but nothing came out.I sharp taste of copper and blood came out of my mouth.Black liquids were pouring out of my eyes and ears. I was lying on my back, my body pointing upwards.I started to plummet down fast. The warmth surrounding me.Suddenly I landed somewhere. A restaurant. With... Juan?Hello, Tiana.” He smiled. You've been out for a while.”Tiana?! How am I here?! You have some questions to answer!” I stood up from the booth.What?” He looked confused.This is Passion.” I growled.He laughed. Don't be silly, Passion died two years ago of suicide. And it's really not funny to joke about her death.”What?!” I steamed.You were at her funeral.” He furrowed his eyebrows. Remember?”No, no, no. YOU killed ME.” I grabbed him by the neck.I didn't kill Passion. There's evidence she killed herself.” He choked.Stop lying, Shit face. I know what you did.” I slammed him against the table, continuing to hold his neck.He was turning blue and his arms were flailing. Fine!”I let go of him and grabbed the steak knife. Well now for my revenge.” I grabbed the knife and stabbed his stomach and sawed it like a chainsaw.His pleads of mercy were drowned out by the screams of waiters and guests.I started laughing uncontrollably. My face became warm and a sudden feeling rushed over me.‘Tiana' or ‘me' walked to the middle of the room and looked up at the ceiling.I flopped down on my back and started sawing my torso open. Like a banana. It was so satisfying and felt amazing. I was still laughing. Then, I dropped the knife and closed my eyes I felt like I was hovering off the floor. Then I touched a hard surface.The ceiling.I slammed her open torso onto it. Again and again. Organs splattered everywhere. I was laughing like a maniac.Until, everything went black again.I woke up at a Japanese restaurant.Hi Riley!” A man across from me smiled. I'm so glad that you finally excepted my date!”"

When a higher ranked player comes with a strat, why dont u listen? To all of you in gold/ plat. Just explain to me why you dont listen plz."

none,"Hi! I am a diamond player who are playing alot of dps and yea always have been a dps main. I never knew that much about ow but then i have been hovering around playing the game, and not. First i thought ""yea dps role is the only thing you can carry on as you can kill people and stuff"" then i found out that tanks need to push the enemy team back and just stand, be there, create space, which can do alot. So i thought ""yea tanks can carry the most"". BUT, then a higher ranked player, i asked ""aint tank the role you can carry the most on?"" and he said ""no? I would say its support since you can keep your team alive and if you just keep on healing them so they dont die, they will do smtg, if they arent just afk.This really suprised me as i always sall support role as ""can you even do stuff on that role? Like carry a whole team and stuff without going full zen lucio dps?"" And i thought out you can!

none,"Hi! I am a 3.340k peak dps player. I got this peak at the start of the season. Then i started kinda soft throwing idk i just kinda lost motivation. But the thing is when i got all that sr i played bad...I played really bad, like i had 0 medals, i died alot, i had no medals or anything,  but i just kept on winning. I dont get it i really dont. Like now i feel like i do very very good when i play the same character (tracer) when i got a lot of sr. I play better i dont die alot or feed and i have better aim and get picks. Now im almost out of dia duo to losing alot. I never tilt, im just kinda confused. Mayby its because i stopped talking duo to some bad episodes being trashtalked cause of my very light voice. I kinda dont wanna talk anymore, cause most of the time i open my mic to say, ""soldier low soldier low "" or smtg people instantly start qustioning me and everything.TLDR: If i play bad i win, if i play good i lose."

I love her so much and i think shes really fun, or do i? thats what i have been asking myself the last days where i have been onetricking her alot. People always blade the widowmaker and stuff.

Its so annyoing my teamates will just be like, ""Dude you're soldier kill the Pharah Mercy, it ez duhhh"" They except us to go in and the pharah will just be dead. Which is really hard, first because they have mercy pocket so if i hit 3 shots in a rw as cree or smtg they will just get heals. In diamond the Pharahs also hide, before the fight breaks out, which makes it much harder to stand behind like ""Imma wait for the Pharah to come then shoot her, then she flanks and instantly 150s me i die, the whole team cries. We lose the fight and my team blames me for being shit and stuff. How to deal with toxicity and killing Pharah Mercy?"

I've noticed that there is a lot of reading, enough to take up 5-6 hours for every day of the year if I wanted to actually read all of my textbooks. My problem is that there is a lot of information and it feels overwhelming. I am not confident that I will be able to memorize everything. Each term goes by really quickly, giving little time to soak up textbooks while also doing the assignments that don't cover much from the textbooks themselves. How am I supposed to remember all of this science and be ready for a career after four years? How did you ready yourself for your career?

none,"I never believed in myself academically, that's the fear I had. I haven't been in school since I dropped out at age 16 (I'm 33) where I was convinced to drop out by my mom. I always felt inferior when around others my age who have gone through college even though they didn't all find a job in their field. Late last year I had dropped out of my first term because the fear came back, and then I re enrolled in May and finished my first term in a different major. I chose Computer programming last time and then this time chose Environmental Science. It feels right and feels like something I should do because I am already passionate about the environment. I just finished my first term with A's, pleasantly surprised I could do so. I failed the final project but I took it as a lesson to learn how to do projects correctly for next time. I still managed to pass with a B+ because of all the A's.I just wanted to share my story with others to maybe inspire them that no matter how much you think you cannot do something, you're wrong."
none,"I see too many posts here where people think their mental health issues or life stresses are going to just disappear by meditating and they stop practicing because they aren't getting the results they think they were going to get. Meditation was never meant to be a magic pill for your problems or any other expectation you have. It is meant to be there as a tool for you to come back to yourself when you feel your consciousness spiraling. It is meant to teach you about the conscious being inside you, your self, that you ignore as you autopilot throughout your daily life. It is meant to enrich your well being just like eating healthy does. When you eat healthy, your body is more able to fight off diseases and ailments. Did your life suddenly become a utopia of everything going your way just because you changed your diet? Of course not. That's the same with meditation. You're still going to have your problems, you're still going to have mental illnesses and trauma, you're still going to be growing until the day you no longer take breath. Meditation is ONE tool in the toolbox of a healthy life.Whenever you feel fear, anxiety, sadness, anger, you can center yourself much more manageably than when you don't meditate. If you really aren't thinking you are benefiting from it, then stop doing it for some time. You'll notice the old habits, feelings, and the unmanageability that was there before start creeping back in. If you don't feel the difference, then you haven't released enough (practiced for enough time). 40 days isn't going to do it, 70 days isn't going to do it, one year isn't going to do it. You need to keep going and stop treating your conscious awakening like it's going to make you feel better instantaneously or feel anything at all. Not everyone gets the same results or at the same amount of time, just like exercising. Tl;drMeditation is for you to connect with yourself which is important for your well being whether you consciously notice the difference or not. There is science to back up the benefits of meditation and it's not always going further than your immune system strengthening or your blood pressure stabilizing. Do it for your health just like exercising, just like eating healthy; do it for YOU."

none,"For me, it wasn't the Baby, not its form anyway. The form WAS terrifying, ngl, but I am used to being hyper focused rather than scared when chased in horror games (thank you Frictional Games). I've never been frightened by any monster more than the invisible flesh eating monster in The Dark Descent, so it's hard to scare me with forms after that monstrosity. The Baby was audibly terrifying to me though, being an audiophile. Ethan's fucking breathing under the bed was more terrifying for me than anything in that scene.The thing that terrified me the most was Donna herself. She is insidious in nature and a sadist. Even though all of it was personal to Ethan, it still got to me. She got into Ethan's head so far that it broke me too. Her puzzles were absolutely disgusting and appalling in nature. There are few games that can make me shake and break into a cold sweat like Donna's madhouse did. This was actually the kind of horror I craved for from Village, which sadly Capcom opted out of after terrifying RE 7. RE 7 was the first game to have me shake in fear the whole way and make me dread loading my last save the next playthrough."

none,"My new roommate has been with me for 8 days with a cat she adopted 2 months ago. My cat has lived here one year. The most interaction the cats have had is under the door. My roommate is never home and always off somewhere busy and that's  their lifestyle. She does not spend much time with her cat like I do with mine, so I understand cat behavior  a lot better than she does. She won't  have to deal with the stress because she is never home. Her cat is confined to her  bedroom like I advised, and I told her to keep it that way for 14 days and that the cats have to meet with the new one either in a crate or behind a gate. Well today, I was in my room doing schoolwork with my door open and my roommate decided to let her cat out without my consent or knowledge to meet my cat. I said nothing because I really hate confrontations and I hate when people put me in the awkward position of correcting them. She did not even bother to mention to me that she had them meet, which I was waiting for her to do when I went down to get  a snack  after she put her cat back in the room. She even left the effing front door wide open the other day when moving stuff in with no regard to my cat who was luckily not coming downstairs  with me that time. She also left the back door ajar for hours after leaving the house the day she moved in. How the eff someone who owns a pet does such absent minded shit is beyond me, but I am stuck with her being my roommate and feel uncomfortable trusting her with my furbaby.Since my roommate obviously has no respect for myself or my cat, what can I do to make sure my cat does not get stressed out? I can deal with the stress of having undependable people around, but I am worried about my cat and don't think it's  fair if I have to resort to confining HIM to my room when this is HIS residency."
none,"This was my first speedrun ever and my fifth playthrough of Rebirth. I made it in 3:37:50. I got lost twice in the maze (still don't  understand that thing) and I always get turned around in the Portal Chamber area when getting the vitae to go into the Hunting Grounds. Those instances probably didn't  help my time! I did not pause my phone timer during loading screens, because I wasn't sure if that was considered cheating or not. I died three times, so that adds about 5 minutes of recovery time. I did go look in the fountain because I was curious how badly wounded I was even though I knew I shouldn't have. I did not know what to exploit or if dying on purpose is the way to skip whole sneak areas, but I got through all sneak areas (except the den) undetected within 2 minutes.To be honest this was a very painful game to speedrun because of the forced blackouts and forced walking scenes. I'm curious how speedrunners have managed to beat the 2:20:00 time because I felt that I did everything I could without knowing how to exploit and without dying much.Tl;drWhat is your time and do you have any tips?"

none,"Other than griefers, an easy target to grip about, what type of player is your least favorite to encounter?Mine (I only play Expert): Players that go down during the Tank because they did not keep their range. You're firing guns ffs. The entire team goes down quickly during the Tank and you're the last one standing, having to strategically calculate your movements if not in an open area. During the fight you are voted to be kicked because they don't understand how bosses work. Players who tell you when not to heal. You may be green, but you're at 40 --one to two knocks from a silent zombie are enough to change that. I can last one medkit in one to two chapters, so pipe down backseat driver who can't make it five feet without healing. Players who take extra medkits Players that kill you to revive you without asking Players that run ahead, activating zombies for everyone else to handle Players who don't pay attention to the health of the team. It takes a split second to scan the health bars and see where everyone is at then offer them one of your items to help Players that flip switches without either asking if everyone's ready or checking if they're even nearby Players that take any of your items while you're being revived, or that take them when near spawn rooms, or they don't look to see if a teammate has a defib before looting your body Players that cut you off to intercept an item when you're clearly headed towards that pickup item Players who don't wait the seconds it takes for a dead player to respawn nearby Downed players that complain when you have to heal or get a better weapon you know is nearby before grabbing them Players that don't understand this game is about helping yourself then helping your team. If you want to play solo, play solo campaigns. Players who complain that a player has shot them. It happens to everybody. Unless the same player is shooting you frequently, it's normal. Players that don't practice short controlled bursts to minimize team shooting. Players that shoot you deliberately because you told them to not take extra health kits or some other violation against L4D etiquette.Update: I only play on PC"

none,"I've played it twice since I purchased a month ago and I already want to play it a third time. It's such a perfect game imo. The ancient ruins aspect of it really invokes adventure within me, I wanted to be an archaeologist when I was a child. I think it's also perfect survival horror and has the amount of tension needed for such a game. I liked that I could run out of oil and matches before I found anymore, leaving me to scuttle in the dark in fear of turning into a ghúl. I think you're not meant to light every room but to experience the horror and tension of taking the chance skipping a room to make it to the next then light something there. It required patience to walk with a lit match, like in real life, and the feeling of failure really struck when you make it to the third torch in the area and it blows out. The lantern burning is unrealistic but we have to remember this is a game and a game creates obstacles for us without regards to reality.Survival horror is meant to not be convenient and challenge the player to pick and choose when to use resources, which this game did very well. I wanted to touch on that because that was the most complained about part of the game. My first playthrough I played on adventure mode without realizing it and was able to walk past enemies without alerting them. This time, I paid attention and chose normal, which really amped up enemies to spot me if I so much as enter a room with them.The consequence of dying was that you have no idea where you are placed, sometimes back to the beginning of the area, and you have to take a time out. That time out sucked for me, waiting when adrenaline is pumping in me and impatiently wanting to get off the floor. I liked this. I was already used to how Frictional Games operates and none of the grievances players mentioned bothered me because they're in every FG game. I liked that there was a way to lower your fear (like other Amnesia games) when you check your baby. I could take a moment to drink some water and re-center myself while Tasi hums or speaks. That was comforting to me in the darkest of spaces.I appreciate the uniqueness FG brings and their refusal to be like the other games. Other games tend to spoil the player with ample supply, allow them to shoot every enemy, and be the same carbon copy story as a book or a movie or even another game. Imo games have seldom stepped out of that cycle during the last 30 years that I've been playing video games. This game and others like it will definitely remain eclipsed by mainstream games because let's face it it's too profound for the general population to properly appreciate it for the art that it is."

none,"Although I reloaded a save to see both endings, I initially chose to take Amari home. There was something odd about the Queen wanting Tasi's child so badly, it was eerie really. The world she lived in was built and run on literal suffering of beings. I couldn't imagine leaving anybody there, even if it meant they would die in our world. At least they would have had a life akin to their own before they go. With Tasi it seemed that she might have let the darkness in too much, but when she got home it was struggling inside her as if it were fighting to live but failing. I think as long as you're down there in that underworld it can consume you. That's just a theory though. Honestly, if I were Tasi and the darkness was consuming me to a point where it was too late then I would leave my daughter with trusted (human) guardians. It just didn't seem like a good place down there for Amari no matter how much it is spun into ""she would live"". What on earth would she do down there, alone? She would be alone and broken because everyone who is human would be in a coffin experiencing pain and her mother is gone. The Queen wanted Amari badly for her own gain is what I think, whatever that may be, I think something beyond wanting to be a mother again. What if Amari was to be harvested and experimented on? There just wasn't anything good going on down in that other world."
none,"Nothing is happening. I have no idea where I'm going which doesn't seem to matter because I just press forward and get to another room without seeing anything cause it's too dark. The matches thing is annoying because you can't move around with it and torches/lamps are few between. You'd think this person would've found a lantern to carry by now. I don't like the caves tbh. In the other games there was at least some sense of where you are going and how to get back somewhere, but this is impossible in caves where everything is rock. I don't see the point of lighting anything considering I'm never returning to those areas.The story from the journals is interesting because they connect the games together, basically the only thing keeping me going. I would hate to stop a game unfinished, especially when I paid thirty dollars for it. Those are basically the only two reasons I see to go on, but even that is hard to be motivated by. I'm really just bored keeping the analog stick forward moving along the rock walls. I loved Dark Descent and Machine For Pigs. What is this game? It feels foreign to the series."

But the morning one really gets to me. I peek at the timer, 10 minutes feels like an eternity. I continue the rest in impatient agony. To me, it feels so excessive to meditate twice per day. I keep going and forcing myself to do it and I'm unhappy doing so. I feel the benefits, that is not the problem. My problem is the practice itself. I don't know if it is a phase or if it will always be this way for me. I don't know what to do about it."

none,"If you were like me and so many others, you got the bad ending. You didn't choose the right action during that pivotal moment. You know which moment. The moment when Claire is being crushed by Neil while Moira has to make a choice to use a firearm. If you got the good ending, aka cannon ending, you might still find this thread entertaining. The purpose of this post is to entertain, so please keep the comments friendly. Let's dive into some lore.   Now, before I ask you why you chose Moira or Claire to finish Neil, I wanna talk about the reason I chose to pass the gun over to Claire and how it made me feel in the end.   Throughout the game we are given tidbits of information about Moira's fear of using a gun before finally getting the reveal to the story of why. Claire never forces or asks Moira to use a firearm, minus the first initial scene near the beginning of the game where Claire tries to hand Moira a gun to use. Moira opts for a crowbar and everything works out. Turns out that kid's got a mean swing and a spunky attitude that I can get down with, so I took no issue that my partner wanted to use a melee weapon   Then the Neil boss fight happened. Claire (me) had just gotten out of a long winded fight with Neil, my hands were aching, heart racing, knees weak palms are.. just kidding. There Neil was crushing my character for a moment before the camera panned over to Moira, urging me to press action for Moira to pick up the gun to shoot Neil. By the time I was this far in the game, I had developed a mamabear love for Moira. That mamabear love made me quickly empathize with her fear even though I knew little about it. I did not want Moira to pick up a weapon and relive her trauma. Claire is a wildcat who can take care of herself. I chose Claire without hesitation.   Fast forward to Barry, Natalia, and Alex in the lab at the final room. The room is on fire, wires are sparking, Barry is on his knee in the final moments of the fight with Alex. He's come so far, struggled for so long, found out his daughter is dead and now he's about to die. Then Natalia comes in between them and incinerates Alex into oblivion with her powerful stare. Barry lives! Natalia is safe from the evil clutches of Wesker! Let's climb up that ladder I scoped out earlier while Alex spider was chasing me up the stairs and sail off into the sunset on a helipcopter that comes out of nowhere!    But, wait...Natalia..why do you seem so...why'd you brush your hair behind your ear so arrogantly just like..   ..now you can call me...Alex.   No sunset. No helicopter. Just Barry's echoing cries calling after the shell that was Natalia.    Crushed. Betrayed. Capcom...why?   I felt a mixure of emotions that a game had never given me before. I was hurt and in awe. Angered and frustrated, I exited the game, turned off my computer, and sat in amber lighting for ten minutes trying to understand what just happened.    In my research later that night, I found that there was more than one ending. Wait a minute.. more than one ending? Why did Capcom decide to implement multiple outcomes into a game traditionally not known for this?   Oh Capcom, can't you stay unique and follow your own music. That's why we like you.   Further into my research, I heard on a video that there were hints throughout the game to guide the player to the good ending. If there were any hints, they were too subtle for me and went way over my head. Many other players' who chose Moira were also unaware of the hints.   Here's where I leave you. You've come so far into this post and I thank you for being here. Please vote on this post and leave a comment below on your choice of Moira or Claire, why you chose one or the other, and how it made you feel.https://preview.redd.it/homjfuf6zio61.jpg?width=340&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=311d8e085bf17cba5467f1d7f5308159f21771d9"
none,"The voice acting and motion capture of Annette is some of the best to be found in games. Annette herself is truly a force to be reckoned with, despite being a scientist. Her intuition with Ada was spot on and her fiercenss towards Ada was well warranted. When Annette locked Ada in the burner, the look in her eyes was of pure contempt for this woman and the delivery of her words pierced like knives. Annette did everything her highly intelligent brain could conjure to stop Ada from obtaining the virus.   Annette sacrificed everything to keep the virus from leaving the facility, making her a strong willed soldier in a labcoat. The fact that she's a scientist and could pull off the things she did was impressive. Annette was so strong that she had the will to kill her husband, William Birkin, once the virus completely consumed his person. Not many of us would be able to do something like that to a loved one, despite how much we'd like to think we could.   Annette placing Sherry in a disposal room seemed harsh, but if you think about it it was the safest place considering the pieces needed to open the thick steel door. Sherry was safe and her father was inside protecting her while he was still able to somewhat control the virus inside him. I think that's why Annette didn't kill him sooner: he was still William. William attacked Claire in reaction to Claire being an intruder.   We got hints from dialogue that Annette and William weren't always around for Sherry and worked long hours. Some of the words Annette chose to speak to Sherry were harsh, showing a love deprived Sherry and a busy mom trying to protect her while getting on with the mission. Annette and William were both scientists for a large corporation, so family time was not first priority. Perhaps this is why Sherry was an only child.

none,"Hi. I, like many of you, have paid for TM courses and went through the study from the Maharishi Foundation with my appointed TM teacher who gave me a mantra I am not supposed to reveal to anyone. We have all been told not to mention the techniques to anyone who has not become a student through the Maharishi Foundation or the David Lynch Foundation for lower income learners. We can talk about the benefits of TM but not the material it comes from. I have seen some posts on this subreddit from people claiming not to have any money for a teacher (even though there's literally a program for them) while they reveal the techniques that they learned from someone somewhere who spilled the beans for free-- possibly a friend or family member. I for one am appalled by this type of behavior because it breaks the promise we make when initially joining. Anyone can join TM, anyone can learn, so it's not as if those people are doing anyone any favors. If you're learning from a different source, it's the wrong technique because authentic TM is patented through the Maharishi Foundation. The website makes this very clear if you need a refresher in memory. It's like you're learning how to perform heart surgery on a human from a horse surgeon. I am disturbed by people who disrespect the promise we made when they reveal everything to the world or their friends. No, you cannot have a mantra without a teacher. The teacher is there for a reason, and our mantra is appointed to you for a reason only they know. The course is tailored to the individual through the teacher. The teacher didn't go through half a year of stufy half way across the world for you to disrepect the practice and go through false avenues to get what you want. Maharishi has spoken on why you cannot use just any word for a mantra, so whatever mantra from some outside kook handed you is false. I just want to share my passion and respect for the teachings of Maharishi and the Foundation and hope some people have the ability do the same. Just think of how it feels when you're a part of a group with a hobby like fencing and you have a secret closing bow with your partners different from other fencing groups and someone from your group reveals it to thr entire community. It's crushing and speaks volumes of that person's integrity."

none,So I made a post in the r/soma subreddit and thought I'd extend it here to get more players involved. I have some theories on how Simon could live out his time under the ocean as he's left behind. I think this could be a fun thread so please go check it out [https://www.reddit.com/r/soma/comments/kfw7sf/simon\_left\_behind\_possibilities\_on\_how\_he\_can/](https://www.reddit.com/r/soma/comments/kfw7sf/simon_left_behind_possibilities_on_how_he_can/)
none,"Hello all. I finished Soma yesterday and can't shake the horror away. When I think of Simon trapped down in the darkness, my stomach sort of turns. It's as if it happened to me, which I guess is kind of true considering I was Simon for the duration of the game. I kind of want to throw out some possible scenarios on what Simon could do for the rest of his days. I want to hear others' ideas and it's also fine if you'd like to debate on mine.I'm **assuming Simon still has the Omnitool** and could **theoretically access the other buildings.** The building he was left at lost power, but the other buildings still had theirs. How these buildings are powered is a mystery to myself, but for theories sake, let's assume they have power for years to come. He could use the Omnitool in these buildings with power to get in and out. He doesn't need to do anything but continue to exist. He may even be able to revive Catherine if he uses resources from somewhere to gain back electricity at the launch computer. Let's say he backtracks across the catwalks from the launch dome. He cannot open the door because the power failure. If he remembers the map, he could climb over the building while using his flashlight and make his way back to the cable elevator. Assuming no monsters get him up there, but really at this point that doesn't matter. All that matters is that Simon gets somewhere comfy and possibly revives Catherine. So, climbing over, he could then reach the elevator car and it still has its own power. Even if the power was out, he could climb up the steel cable. Once up out of the Abyss, he can continue to find resources as he sneaks past the monsters still lingering around. In fact, he could try to eventually kill them all through clever means. Afterall, he has forever. What bothers me is that Simon is a machine and machines need to charge, right? But that never happened during the game. It's like he can just go on and on for years. So let's assume he can and let's assume the electricity goes on for years too. I honestly think the launch overpowered everything and that was why the power went out in the launch dome. Anyway, lost track of myself. He can use the light posts to find his way to and from each location and basically live out his time as an occupant of either one, or all.**What would he do down there?** After Simon comes to peace with himself and is happy for everyone who escaped Earth ( as he should be imo), he can continue to live a relatively good life despite his isolation (he could still revive Catherine). He could find books in the living quarters to occupy his time. He could bury the humans. He could explore the ocean surrounding a bit more. He could make some experiments in one of the labs for fun. He could repair things. He could study buddhism and meditate. He could learn an instrument. He could find many things to do since the humans required things to do while down there too. As a machine, he is so unlimited in what he can do down there compared to us humans.Do you think he could find a way to regain power to the launch dome one day? Maybe there are books on the right subjects to help him figure it out. If he did, he could launch himself into space if there is another rocket down there to launch. At this point, he either has many years into the ocean or many years into space. Whether or not they are dangerous enough to kill him doesn't matter. The only alternative would be to sit in the launch dome and cry.Sorry if some of this seemed jumbled, I write my thoughts as they come. Let me know what you think and if I missed something. I just can't stand the thought of Simon giving up, sitting in darkness until he dies. This isn't the end, Simon. We are still rooting for you."
none,"Methods tried:* tin foil* cat tape* shaking loud canister* 10 minute time outMy cat does not care about loud noise, so shaking a canister with objects inside even right next to him doesn't startle him. He came from the streets near a busy highway about 2 months before I adopted him. He was never scared of the vacuum cleaner either. When I tried the tape, it worked for a week but then he would just endure it to get to wherever he was on his way to. Same thing with the foil. He does respond to time-outs with other things and listens when I warn him before he's about to do something. For the counters, he will do anything! I don't have food up there, so maybe it's just the height? I see those cat shelves on Amazon but they are stupid expensive, should I just get one?

The road was somewhat rocky but my car was more than capable of going through it. I just took it slow to be safe. Suddenly, the radio turned off and the car jolted VERY hard to the left as I began a turn. I slammed on my brakes almost seconds before going off the face of  the cliff. Absolutely terrified, I threw the car quickly into reverse in an attempt to back off the ledge. However, my cars wheel was locked entirely to the left. I thought I may have lost power steering but no. The wheel was being held to the left. This lasted for about 5 seconds until somehow, the wheel returned to the correct position. I didn't really think too hard on it, thinking maybe I hit a loose rock that rolled with my wheels forcing the wheel to lock hard to the left, so I continued the climb cautiously, thinking I may have damaged my steering rack. We drove around on top of the mountain checking everything out to make sure it was properly working. I checked my car's rack/pinion and pump before descending and finally began the drive down. This is where it gets a little weird. In the exact same spot where the loss of steering and music happened, my wheel suddenly jerked to the RIGHT, pushing us right towards the edge of the cliff. When I say jerked.. I mean ripped from my hands jerked. I could not fight back against the wheel. Once again, I slammed on my brakes mere feet before the drop, saving myself and my passenger. Once again, 5 seconds went by and the steering wheel returned to its correct position and the music turned back on.Now im not one for paranormal but it is very strange that the wheel jerked TWO different ways in the same spot. One of my theories is that there may have been some sort of electromagnetic field being generated by the radio tower but why on earth would they allow visitors to the top of the hill, nonetheless have the field run through the most dangerous part of the climb?"
none,"Im a recent college grad heading into the city on Monday to interview for the position of 'Film Editor' at a rather large media company. I am highly experienced in Premier, After Effects and Resolve and I can put on a good front, so im not nervous necessarily about proving my talents or just being a human I guess but this is my first professional interview. It truly is what I want to do and I want everything to go perfect. I was wondering if this community has any suggestions, tips or just advice for this type of job. Also, they told me that they will be giving me a 'Challenge Piece' to complete. What exactly does this mean? I figure its some sort of timed edit but if someone could explain what exactly this means, that would be hugely helpful.\-Alex"
none,"I couldn't find a lot of good answers on the internet but basically, I just caught my big break and have gotten swamped with animation requests.

none,"So im about to graduate film school. Well receive a bachelors in creative media + film. I'm a fairly talented cinematographer but my specialty is in the realm of post production. I've worked (and am working) on various freelance projects that I have filmed myself along with projects that have been filmed by others, which they've sent to me to edit. Of course now that im graduating, I will no longer have access to my schools high end cinema cameras. Plus, I want to move out of state to pursue my goal of eventually becoming a post production director on major feature films.It would seem that most jobs I've been viewing in cities where I could definitely start pursuing my climb to my overarching goal, generally require potential candidates to own a camera. It seems that a number of small businesses want someone to create media types and being that video is the best form of advertising, there seems to be a push for film makers bundled with the skills in post.What im asking, is would it be a good investment to buy a camera (or two) even if I consider myself more skilled behind a computer screen rather a camera lens?"
none,"It was 2017, there wasn't a lot going on, and it was a lazy weekend. I was scrolling through movies in theaters and saw the latest transformers movie; it jogged my memory. A person I enjoyed watching compete on an obstacle course tv show was a stunt person in the movie! Well, there wasn't much else to do and watching robots fight didn't sound too bad, so I went to watch the movie and take a picture of the person's name in the credits (I repeat it was a lazy weekend).Got there, sat through 2+ hours of mind-numbing stuff, only to have the credits set to 100x normal speed and names go flying by like lightening. It was a rather silly, trivial thing, the type of thing you do when you don't have much better to do, but man did I feel cheated. The absurdity of sitting through that for something so small and oddly specific, only to miss it when I should have known better, makes me chuckle to this day.TL;DR Went to a transformers movie just to see the name of a stunt person I liked in the credits, only to have them go 100x the normal speed."

none,"Before I say anything else, I want to clarify that I am aware this is a controversial topic and this is not meant as an attack against a genre I enjoy. I have simply noticed, and it has been pointed out, that some nu metal music has contained noticeable sexism. Do you think that this is the case with any genre, as there are bound to be some artists that use sexist tropes? Do you think that artists are simply writing stories and it is not harmful in any way? Will you turn off or avoid a song you think is sexist? Do you care more about the music than the lyrics?  There are no right or wrong answers. Thank you for taking the time to read and comment on this post."

none,"This happened before the pandemic but I remember it now and it makes me laugh.  I had my little cousin over and we were playing outside. Her hair got a bit messy so I went to brush it. You know how adding a ‘y' or ‘sies' to the ends of words makes them cute and silly? Like ponies, horsies, kitties, doggies etc.? Well I said,Time to get all the little knotsies out!”Amazingly I didn't realize it until later when she got picked up and she told everyone about how I brushed out the knotsies”. Luckily we all had a good laugh about it but remember to think about how words sound before you say them!TL/DR: Tried to make the word ”knots” cute because I was brushing out my little cousin‘s hair and said ”knotsies”. Laughed about it later when it hit me."
none,"As a lot of posts here go, this didn't happen today, but actually a few days ago. A termite guy was over to help get rid of, well, termites, and I was upstairs hiding in my room with my headphones and mask on to avoid all contact. Well, my cat had just come upstairs to hide under my bed too, and I took off the headphones momentarily to try to coax her out.Now, I always check my volume. Always. But of course, not this time. So I put my headphones back on, and didn't think to make sure the volume was properly adjusted. I had turned it all the way up. Like, all the way.Well the song I chose to listen to in that moment wouldn't be too noteworthy otherwise, but given the context, it was going to lead to a minor disaster on my part. The open guitar riff, that slow chopping buzzsaw humming sound of the song Pepper assaulted my ears at a loudness I still haven't recovered from. It was so loud you could hear it outside of the headphones. My heart nearly stopped in that moment as I fumbled desperately to turn it off. My parents and the termite guy were downstairs, talking over the plan and what he had just done. The combination of them talking loudly and the fact that they were somewhat far away made the 5 seconds of funny humming/scratching noises that came from above seem extremely suspicious when they had just been dealing with insects.Did you hear that sound?” my mom asked.”It sounded like humming...”My ears still half deafened, I grasped what had just happened, and what was going to happen when my mom became paranoid over the sound.I didn't check all of the rooms up there, would you like me to take a quick look? It is possible they could be flushed out improperly if there was a place I had missed.””Sure, can't hurt!”And the heavy boots of the termite guy pounded upstairs. He opened the door and saw me sitting there, face still red from falling off of my chair at the noise, clutching a pair of headphones, surrounded by my music posters. Me and my cat sat there shamefully while he confirmed that there were no termites in that room.TL;DR I didn't check my headphone volume while a termite guy was over, and the sound of a song was so loud that my parents could hear it downstairs and thought it was more termites upstairs, which led to me being discovered when I had tried to avoid contact.Edit: thoroughly irritated by the anti-maskers in the comments. If you are so pro-personal ‘liberties', then why do you care if I want to wear one?"

none,"This story happened to me last year.I have a kink. Whenever I'm in a hotel  I love leaving my room naked for a little daring walk through the hallway. Just a couple of metres. I take the keys to my room with me of course.Dont ask why, it's just a huge turn on. I‘ve done it plenty of times without ever being caught.So on that very night I was drunk and left my room around midnight. It was on the fifth and last story of the hotel. When I left my room I had to choose between going left ( 40m to the next corner) or right (10m to the corner). So I turned right where I only had to pass three doors.I passed them and suddenly realized that one of those doors went open and two guys came out so I rushed around the corner and started to run since I heard them heading in my direction. They didn't notice me though.After a couple of meters I had to turn left where I saw a door (glass) on the righthanded sight that lead to stairs and the elevator on the left.I had no time to think and decided to hide down the stairs. Best idea would have been to keep running in a circle until I reach my room again but as I said I was drunk and had no time to think. Since it was the last story of the building I needed to go downstairs and waited there for a second. PANIC! They also took the stairs. So i needed to run down the next stairs as well in order to get to the next door. I finally reached it and it was locked. A couple of seconds later I knew why. It was some kind of exit that lead directly to the streets.So I had two options. Either face them or keep running down the stairs until I reach the streets.I choose to keep running. Drunk and in panic... please dont ask.A bit later a left the building and went straight behind a bush. The 2guys passed without noticing me. But here I was bare naked on the streets in the middle of the night.I tried to open the door again but it was locked.I remained there thinking for a minute until I went to face my only option. I ran around the corner through the main entrance. The guy behind the corner was shocked and just said something like ‚excuse me...‘ but i ran straight to the stairs ( the main stairs) as fast as I could. On the way up to my room I luckily didn't meet anyone else but it felt like hours.I made it in my room where I was waiting in shock waiting for the counter guy to knock. But he didn't.It was exciting but stupid af I know. I didn't leave the room the next morning because I tried to keep out of the way of the guy behind the counter.It's my first time telling the story. Please don't be too harsh with me.TL;DR by leaving my hotel room naked and ended up on the streets in front if the hotel."
none,"Just imagine that. The trio maintaining as best friends... but they are in different houses.They all come to Hogwarts expecting to be sorted into Gryffindor. But...Harry is in Slytherin. Hermione is in Ravenclaw.Ron is in Hufflepuff.And let's maintain Gryffindor as the most celebrated House of all.They have to watch and hear about the heroic ""glory"" of being a Gryffindor from outside because none of them are in that house. They keep hearing about how so many amazing heroic wizards come from that House including Dumbledore, the Order, all the ""good"" wizards during the war, the Weasleys and even Harry's own parents. This makes them feel like the underdogs or outsiders. Top students, best Quidditch players, etc, are all from Gryffindor.They would spend time together, eating and doing homework, and sneak out of their dorms to meet each other, and get weird looks from other students as they break the House barriers and not just hang out with students from their own Houses.Harry would share a dorm with Malfoy, which in turn would be his frienemy at the school. An on/off friendship with Malfoy would spice things up, especially during later parts in the series. Malfoy would feel betrayed by Harry, and vice versa. Harry feel betrayed when Draco confronts Dumbledore on the Astronomy tower. Then have them help each other out during the final battle. And so on. The dynamic would be amazing.Harry would also feel a deeper connection to his Slytherin side as he spend time with them, learning about Salazar Slytherin and Voldemort. Being proud that he is a Parselmouth. Let's have several conflicting moments where Harry feel that being a Death Eater is okay. And moments where he has to choose between ""good"" and ""evil"". Let's have Draco's parents visit and praise Harry a lot for being Draco's friend and telling him to stay away from the Weasleys.Ron would have direct relationship to Cedric and would be conflicted about who to support during the Triwizard tournaments. Cedric's death would affect him a lot and distance him from Harry after the tournament. And they would be rivals during Quidditch for that matter.Hermione would be the smartest among the trio, but always felt challenged as she is surrounded by smart and academically-focused students. She would be the source of knowledge for the other two (well, duh). But she always feel underestimated because she is not as celebrated as the Gryffindors.What do you think? How else would the story be different if they were sorted in different houses but still maintain as best friends? Let me know your thoughts!(excuse any typos or grammatical errors, typing this as I'm walking)"
none,"Not in a suicidal way (though I won't rule this out). But in an isolated way. Let me explain.If you were in a relationship before, seeing your ex happier with someone else now.You get rejected, then seeing your crush happier with another person.Your friends ditched you, and they are happier with another group of friends.Your best friend abandoned you, because they are happier in a relationship.People ignoring your calls or messages, yet they are active on social media responding to other people.People won't hang out with you, but have no problems meeting up with other people.You get the point...What is up with this isolation? Why do people seem to be happier when they are NOT with me? I feel like such a burden. Am I not cool enough? Not rich enough? Not good looking enough. And it snowballs too. Just be positive, they say. No, this been going on for decades and I don't know how to stay positive about it.I'm sure I'm not the only one."

Is the salary at that company too low? Maybe there's no career progression in that company? Perhaps the company doesn't give the recognition that the employees deserved? Perhaps the boss is a very abusive individual?**When you go to a job interview and the interviewer asks why you spent less than a year at a company.**Most candidates would say: I'm looking for a better opportunity, I moved so I needed to find a job that is closer to my place, I decided that job wasn't my passion, a family member was sick so I had to focus on taking care of them, etc.Things you cannot say: My boss was an abusive person. The company doesn't give fair treatment to me. I wasn't compensated fairly. I started to develop depression and anxiety.

none,"I have worked for years. And this year is the year I finally paid off my debt, made an investment and put up my parents old house for rent (my parents have another house in which they live in). Below market price, trust me. I know the pain of paying nonsense rental prices.So the money that I made each month (without any salary) is enough to cover food for myself, bills, gas for my car, insurance, a bit of savings and a bit of allowance I wish to give to my parents. I'm not gonna be a multi-millionaire anytime soon, nor will I be traveling around the world or buying a boat. But I can get by without a 9-5 job. Yet... My parents look at me disapprovingly when I told them about this. They said it's good that I make some money on the side, but i should just keep on climbing the career ladder and I can have double or triple the money I make now.My old friends look at me like I'm being weak or giving up on life. They keep telling me that I will regret this decision to leave my career.My colleagues just think I'm lazy, selfish and a traitor to the company.The girl that I'm dating thinks that, if I go ahead with this decision, then I'm some sort of a bum who's gonna be homeless soon.In reality, I'm doing this (letting go of my career and finding other pursuits in life while sustaining myself through my investments and rental) because I'm tired. I'm physically and mentally exhausted. I'm sick of having breakdowns every other week. I'm sick of feeling my heart beat rising and having to deal with anxiety at the workplace.I want to sleep. I want to enjoy my days. I wanna plant some trees. I want to read books. I want to find my passion in life (which I have no idea what because I grew up thinking I need to work in an office to be successful).But maybe I've been brainwashed since I was a kid. So even knowing that I have enough money to support myself, I still feel so anxious and so guilty to let go of my job. The pressure from the people around me doesn't help either."

none,"(Warning: Long post, if you don't mind reading)I couldn't sleep last night, probably because I was too stressed out about work and money. So I popped a melationin pill to help me get to sleep. It worked, obviously. Melatonin can also cause very vivid dream since it helps put you in deep sleep faster and/or longer. It's been 4 hours since I woke up and I'm still thinking about this dream.It started at the university's cafeteria (I graduated from uni in 2014, I'm almost 28 years old now). I was sitting at the round table outside, with 4 of my friends. We were having a drink, talking and laughing. In the dreams, we were all best friends, which is odd now that I think about it, because I never really had friends.As we were talking, a girl walked by the table. She was gorgeous. She had glasses on, with a red lipstick. Her hair was short, black and wavy. She looked professional like she worked at an office. This is normal, most people at my university dressed up like that, especially on days we had to do a presentation.She looked at me and offered her hand. ""Let's go. We're gonna be late!"" she said. I knew in my dream that her name was June.I immediately remembered that we were gonna have a dinner date together. I took her hand and told my friend sorry, I had to go. She pulled me off the chair and we walked together, hand in hand.We walked quite fast. Not rushing. More like happy, with a bounce in each step. Our hands interlocking, swaying back and forth. I glanced at her. She was looking at her feet, smiling. And I thought to myself, I'm the luckiest guy in the world.How was your day? I asked. Busy, she answered, now looking at me. ""But glad it's the weekend, so I can have you all to myself.""The sun was going down now and we reached the parking lot and headed to my car. Also an odd detail because I didn't have a car when I was still studying. We got in a drove off. The sun was setting.I asked her where we were heading. She said the name of the restaurant, which I can't seem to remember now, but in the dream, I know exactly where it was and it was near the beach area. And she added, ""...silly!"" at the end of her answer as if I just asked her the dumbest question. Right, I said. ""What would you like to eat there?""I just want to have coffee. And maybe a cake for dessert. I also want to try their shrimps!That sounds... expensive, I said, worried.We can share, she assured me. ""Let's just order that. We can share the shrimps, the cake, and the coffee, if you don't mind."" She grabbed my hand that wasn't on the steering wheel and said, ""It's not about the food. I just want to spent the evening with you."" I looked at her for a second and we smiled at each other.I kept on driving till we reached the beach area. But there was a long line of cars on the road. We were stuck. The sun was gone and it was already dark at this point.Damn. We're gonna be here for a while. This looks bad, I said. There was a line of cars behind us and in front of us.Good! she said. ""That means I get to spend even more time with you."" She took my hand with both of hers, brought it up to her face and kissed the back of my hand. ""Mwah!""I remember squeezing her hand tightly, taking a deep breath and... My eyes opened. I saw the ceiling fan spinning slowly above me. It was morning. My hand was still squeezing something that didn't exist. I closed my eyes and said, ""No... Fuck.""Got up. Sat on the bed. Rubbed my eyes and face. Looked around my empty room to make sure it was really just a dream.And it was.I felt completely and utterly destroyed. Depressed. As if I just lost something that was never even there to begin with. I hate my life. Wish I could go back to that life, in that dream. It was perfect."

The number of cases spiked in Malaysia.* Mar: Malaysian government put the country under quarantine lockdown called a Movement Control Order (MCO). MCO was done pretty well with most of the citizens following orders, staying at home, working from home, ordering food online. The streets and shops were mostly empty during this time.* Mar-Apr: the number of cases had gone up with an average of 100 cases a day and 10 or less deaths per day. The number continue to rise, but also stabilise (""the curve flattening"") and Malaysians even saw days without COVID-19 related deaths. And number of new cases drop from 100 a day to a mere 30-60 a day. The movement control order was still in place as the number kept dropping.\*Now THIS is where things get interesting...* Mid April: China praised Malaysia's Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah for all his efforts and strategies implemented to control the spread of COVID-19.* Mid April: China TV stations named Malaysia's Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah ""top doctor"" in the world.

Malaysia was doing well in controlling the spread of COVID-19, so why did China send their medical experts to help out a country that was actually doing well?2. Suddenly, Malaysia is working with China to develop a vaccine.3. And Malaysia accepted to be the ""volunteer"" for the vaccines from China.4. And now, the Prime Minister suddenly announced that everyone can go back to work next Monday (4 May).Does any of these seem suspicious to you?

none,One of the reasons why I love these two movies is because you can Google whatever they are talking about and something in real-life will come up. Are there any other movies or series that are like this?I can only think of The Da Vinci Code (2006) where they take some real-life history or myths and include them in the storyline.
none,"Could be films, series or books. I always find stories where the characters have to follow certain set of rules to be quite engaging. Especially in horror, where the rules make you feel a bit claustrophobic. I even enjoyed movies like ""I, Robot"" (not horror) for the same reason."
none,"Emphasis on ""Good"".I'm looking for something suspenseful and scary but does not content sex and nudity. Much like A Quiet Place (which is perfect). I wanna have a horror movie session with my family. So I don't want horror movies that contain some sort of nudity or sex scenes."
none,"There's this girl that I met once at the end of last year for business purposes. I added her on LinkedIn and we casually messaged each other on there several times. That's it.Then, the COVID-19 pandemic happened, and lockdown happened. I was bored, so I started chatting with people online. I said hi to her to ask her how she was doing.We talked. For weeks now!And it's just so beautiful. She is so cool and funny. We made jokes and filled our times chatting during this lockdown. She told me about her worries, her dreams, her future, her life, what she wanted to do, what she wants to do in the future. We found out a lot about each other.Turned out she is from my hometown (which is like 200 miles away from here). She literally grew up a mile away from my childhood house. We also share the same birthday (which is wild!). We promised to trade presents on our birthdays.And we enjoyed the same books and songs. We spent the past two weeks suggesting songs to each other and discussing books we read before. She asked me about my work, my life, my family. Plenty of ""Good mornings"" and ""Good nights"" texts too.I know she is under lockdown at her place and I am at my own place. But for the first time in a LONG time, my friends, I didn't feel so alone. I felt like I found someone, you know? It's just so nice.And today I told her this, ""Hey, I like talking to you. You're cool. Thanks for all the book suggestions. Once this pandemic is over, how about we go get dinner? You said you miss eating ribs. So let's go eat ribs?! I know a place.""And her reply? ""I'm so sorry. I think I may have given you the wrong sort of message. But I have a boyfriend. So I don't think going for dinner would be such a good idea. Let's just stay friends, yeah?""And my dumb ass replied, ""Sure, I love being friends with you!""Well, that was a nice 2 weeks. I'm pretty sure that is the last time I will ever interact with her. Coronavirus, kill me now, FFS."
none,I'm looking for movies with similar theme of:* Suspense* Horror* Survival* Not knowing what's out there* Not knowing where the threat originated from
none,"Yes, we (the people around here) talked to him about it and tried to reason with him. But he doesn't give a fuck.We also talked to the police, but the police said they can't really do anything since it's a private property.Well, Reddit it is then. I need my sleep, dammit! What should I do?"
none,"I used to work in sales where it's hustling 24/7. So my playlist used to be all about Kendrick, Eminem and a bit of Rob Bailey and the Hustle Standard. LolBut I no longer work in that line and have moved on to something creative.What are some songs to add to my playlist to listen to in the morning so that I feel happy, cheerful, positive and upbeat and I can walk into the office with a smile?"
none,"Alsoamn, I feel so shitty and weak now after 2 hours of hitting the gym, says no one, ever.Don't think about now, brothers. Think about the future. The long-term. A 5-second high. Or a great life ahead. Your choice."
none,"You know you're addicted to porn when the regular shit doesn't do it for you anymore. So you start searching for more hardcore stuff. Over time, hardcore becomes weird. And weird just become plain degenerate.You start developing attraction to the most filthy shit you can come across. Something in your brain is loose. Sex doesn't make you feel anything anymore.You need to see girls choking, crying, struggling and in pain, being treated like a piece of human garbage. The same girls who probably signed up for this kind of stuff because money is hard to come by, but they needed to pay off their loans or their acting/modeling career didn't take off as planned.The same girls who are probably forced to do this because their contracts said so, even though they no longer want to. The girls who are afraid to say no because they are surrounded by dozens of guys and all the cameras are pointing at them and the director says go!But now their life choices are immortalized on the internet for sick and lonely men to jerk off to while being alone in their bedrooms in front of their computers, thinking, ""This... This must be true romance.""All this while, a jacked up dude with a 12-inch dick who's probably on drugs, medication and steroids just got paid thousands of dollars for disrespecting women in front of the cameras. What a huge superstar he is. In the next few years, he's gonna retire because he found out he is HIV positive like some others in his industry. So he starts speaking against pornography in regrets, but it's already too late.But you... You spend hours searching for the filthiest thing you could find. Your 2-inch dick is already limp and soft. Even beating your own dick takes some effort now. All this effort just for that 5 seconds of pleasure. And it didn't even feel as good as the last time you did it. You wonder why. Then your thoughts cleared. A cocktail of imbalanced hormones working up your brain in the most unnatural way. You lay in bed. You feel ashamed. You feel disgusted. And you realized, ""WTF have I become?"" And it's not even in a funny way. It's in a ""I hate myself to the point of developing suicidal tendency"" kind of way.You feel anxious and depressed. You hate your life. You hate your friends. You hate that one girl who you had a crush on back in high school and rejected you. You hate your job. You hate your parents. You hate yourself. You hate this feeling.I know, you tell yourself. ""I felt great that one time watching that one video from 2 weeks ago. What was it called again?""And the cycle continues..."
none,"Okay, so here's the rule of the Soul Stone that we know of:To ensure that whoever possesses it understands its power, the stone demands a sacrifice. In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. A soul for a soul.Easy enough to understand.In Infinity War, Thanos loved her favourite daughter Gamora and reluctantly threw her off the ledge and was rewarded with the Soul Stone which he wielded with the other Infinity Stones to kill 50% of all living beings. Okay, cool.In Endgame, Clint and Nat went to Vormir to get the Soul Stone. Upon learning the rule of the Soul Stone, both were reluctant to sacrifice the other. Until Nat sacrificed herself. If anything, Clint was really trying to prevent this from happening, but was rewarded the Soul Stone anyway.He brought it back and the Hulk uses the stones to return 50% of life that Thanos destroyed. But wait a sec? How can the Hulk wield the power of the Soul Stone if he didn't make any sacrifice to obtain it?Then Tony used it. And we all know how that turned out.The only person who didn't use the Soul Stone was the one person who supposedly sacrificed someone he loved to obtain it. Even then, he didn't really sacrifice Nat.This bothers me so much. Discuss!Edit: If the sacrifice was needed to obtain the stone but not to wield it, then Thanos could've just kidnapped two people who love each other and force one of them to sacrifice the other. Then he can take the stone for himself without having to sacrifice his own beloved daughter. But I guess Infinity War Thanos was more noble than that."
none,"The anniversary event will be giving away 100 free summons, along with a ton of resources to help people level up their units.The game gets brought up on here frequently, for good reason. Some people absolutely love it, some don't! That's fine, it's an absolutely cute and quirky game that's worth trying out.During the anniversary update, they're also making World 10 and 11 easier to clear for newer players too. It's an incredible time to start now, and reap the rewards soon!"

We always recommend mono element teams first, since it's the easiest to raise. Once you've settled on a roster, feel free to put in a few summons for weapons to flesh out and gear your team. From there, generally Hero summons are worth more in the long term because Hero Crystals (used to limit break heroes) can only obtained by dupe summons.

They're important for later on when you finally 5* a hero and want to limit break them (increase their level cap). Basically it's an endgame currency.* **Mileage Tickets** - This is used only to pity units. These are important only because the faster you can get 300 tickets, the faster you can get any hero or exclusive weapon you want in the game. There are ""Mileage events"" that come around from time to time. You can gain bonus mileage tickets when you summon 30/60 times for Hero summons and 30/60 times for Weapon summons.* **Awakening Crystals** - These are used to upgrade your hero's passives and raw stats.

They introduced stat locking gems so you can lock specific stats before rerolling, and a brand new real time coop mode they're still testing things out in. So things will continue to be added to the coop feature as time goes on.The devs have really shown how much they care for the game and community. I always recommend the game to anyone. Try it at the very least for the fantastic story."

none,dank memes only.have fun and enjoy!
none,"Hello travelers!Low quality meme posts have been a problem for the subreddit since day one of the game's release, with many being highly upvoted and filling up the front page. They crowd out text-based content and stifle good discussion. To combat that, we've removed tens of thousands of posts and upped our standards, but didn't really consider the people who like looking at such memes.##Most memes will now have a new home at **/r/Genshin_Memepact**We will still allow certain meme posts on /r/Genshin_Impact though, as long as they're original and high-effort.You may wonder what qualifies as a high quality meme post that's allowed on the main sub. Here are a couple examples of some ""genshinfied"" quality meme content. (Please keep in mind that we will still remove a lot of duplicate content.

Whether you need help with team building, you're stuck, or anything else it all belongs in here.***# Common Questions:###### What's the most active world for NA? World 1 or 2, and what's the difference?Both worlds are quite active, but there's a difference in population experience. World 1 has more veteran players and established guilds that can help. World 2 is brand new and just opened on launch to give everyone equal grounds for launch day. Both worlds are active and have great communities. It's up to you on which world you want to play on.###### Do my choices in the story affect the outcome in any way?As of right now nothing is implemented that'll change the outcome from the choices you make. Just have fun and choose what you want to choose for now.###### Is there a general guide anywhere?[Yes there is! /u/fugogugo has written quite a comprehensive general guide on the game to get you started.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EqRUNT8Ur5TlIgK_WZ8AW36SJk2_VjbGYhMbPjthfGs/edit)###### Can your party member activate weapon skills?No they cannot, only the main hero you're using can activate weapon skills. However if your party members have an extra built-in ability like Tinia's Desert Arrow or Marina's Pulling Anchor, those skills will be used off cooldown.###### Who's good to reroll for? What's the process like, and is it worth doing?You can get almost every 2-star hero in the game, and most uniques heroes (3-stars) are great too. A lot of units will shine even more with their exclusive weapons. [For more information on rerolls, go here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuardianTales/comments/hzipzt/tldr_for_the_new_players_incoming/)###### Should I prioritize Hero summons or Weapon summons?As a newer player, Hero summons are what you should go for until you have a stable roster you want to build up. We always recommend mono element teams first, since it's the easiest to raise. Once you've settled on a roster, feel free to put in a few summons for weapons to flesh out and gear your team. From there, generally Hero summons are worth more in the long term because Hero Crystals (used to limit break heroes) can only obtained by dupe summons. Rare exclusive weapons can still be made by just playing the game and doing random weapon evolutions. However if a weapon banner rate-up comes along, feel free to summon on it if you need that weapon.###### What are some important items I should know about?The most important items you should keep tabs on are the following -* **Hero Crystals** - these are only obtained through summoning dupes. They're important for later on when you finally 5* a hero and want to limit break them (increase their level cap). Basically it's an endgame currency.* **Mileage Tickets** - This is used only to pity units. These are important only because the faster you can get 300 tickets, the faster you can get any hero or exclusive weapon you want in the game. There are ""Mileage events"" that come around from time to time. You can gain bonus mileage tickets when you summon 30/60 times for Hero summons and 30/60 times for Weapon summons.* **Awakening Crystals** - These are used to upgrade your hero's passives and raw stats. Super important for just getting a strong character. These take priority too just because you're locked to 3 runs of Awaken Dungeon a day (unless you pay gems to do more.)###### What should I do with Hero Crystals? Do I spend it on Evolution shards or limit break my heroes?The general consensus is that you should be saving all your Hero crystals to limit break your heroes. For you to fully limit break a 2-star hero, it'll take 350 Hero Crystals. If you want to limit break a 3-star hero, it'll take about 700 Hero Crystals.**IF YOU'RE F2P, SAVE YOUR HERO CRYSTALS TO LIMIT BREAK.**If you're a whale, do whatever you want with them.###### Is there co-op in the game?Not yet! Hopefully it'll be implemented soon.###### What should I do with dupe exclusive weapons?You can limit break them or just hold onto them. The choice is up to you.###### What should I upgrade first in my Heavenshold tower base?Anything you want, the general consensus is to upgrade your Inn and Sky Garden first so you can unlock Plitvice. Afterwards just build how you want to build.# Megathread Compilation[Guild Recruitment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuardianTales/comments/i0uxrc/guild_recruitment_megathread/?)

Basically it's an endgame currency.* **Mileage Tickets** - This is used only to pity units. These are important only because the faster you can get 300 tickets, the faster you can get any hero or exclusive weapon you want in the game. There are ""Mileage events"" that come around from time to time. You can gain bonus mileage tickets when you summon 30/60 times for Hero summons and 30/60 times for Weapon summons.* **Awakening Crystals** - These are used to upgrade your hero's passives and raw stats. Super important for just getting a strong character. These take priority too just because you're locked to 3 runs of Awaken Dungeon a day (unless you pay gems to do more.)###### What should I do with Hero Crystals? Do I spend it on Evolution shards or limit break my heroes?The general consensus is that you should be saving all your Hero crystals to limit break your heroes. For you to fully limit break a 2-star hero, it'll take 350 Hero Crystals. If you want to limit break a 3-star hero, it'll take about 700 Hero Crystals.**IF YOU'RE F2P, SAVE YOUR HERO CRYSTALS TO LIMIT BREAK.**If you're a whale, do whatever you want with them.###### Is there co-op in the game?Not yet! Hopefully it'll be implemented soon.###### What should I do with dupe exclusive weapons?You can limit break them or just hold onto them. The choice is up to you.###### What should I upgrade first in my Heavenshold tower base?Anything you want, the general consensus is to upgrade your Inn and Sky Garden first so you can unlock Plitvice. Afterwards just build how you want to build.# Links[Official GT Discord](https://discord.gg/UrXWzvG)  [Fan-made GT Discord](https://discord.gg/7vTjHPS)  [Guardian Tales Support](https://guardiantales.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)  [Official GT Twitter](https://twitter.com/GuardianTalesEN)  [Official GT Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/guardiantales/)# Guides[General Guide covering the basics by /u/fugogugo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EqRUNT8Ur5TlIgK_WZ8AW36SJk2_VjbGYhMbPjthfGs)[Temporary Re-roll Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuardianTales/comments/hzipzt/tldr_for_the_new_players_incoming/)[Unlockable Heroes in Story Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQZU29vJquoppWJHZftgMNXHReI-Ni_dlz3vuBdOzsQvEJbvvhx93SniXF8pQBMGSdpC7SUj9UHFDCm/pub)"

none,"Since the lord of Electro Raiden is confiscating Vision from all vision holders in Inazuma, I have an idea for a wanted system / horde mode for Inazuma. When you use an ability in the city perimeter and a guard sees you, you are wanted. Guards will spawn and start apprehending you. This system is similar to the police system in GTA games. The number of guards and their health/ damage/aggression will increase as you kill more guards. At a certain point, they will start pulling the Cyberpunk 2077 Houdini trick and spawn right on your ass. When the guards are defeated they'll vanish in smoke, similar to the Treasure hoarders (don't want dead body lying in the city, so we?)This assault will only end when you die, run out of the city perimeter or teleport outside. When you die, the game will simply respawns you outside (don't want to tamper with the story line)What this system brings to the game is a hoard/survival mode that so many people asked for, while complying to the Inazuma lore. The rewards for killing guards can be an achievement for killing, say, 100 guards. Killing each guards won't grant you anything, we don't want to create an infinite farming methods.

none,"So I came across a discussion in the mega thread about should MHY have a pity system for desirable main stats such as Crit rate and Crit dmg. Someone else put up an argument that if everyone all have good artifacts then there will be no incentive to play the game.So,  I want to raise a discussion: should MHY make good loots rain? I'm talking about events that increase the drop rate for CR/CD artifacts, times 5 enhancement bonuses, etc. Will it bored the players so quickly that they stop playing once they have the perfect set? Or will it keep the player base since they know these events will return?Then,  I want to ask another question, if you get the perfect set for a character do you keep using that character, or do you stop using them since there's nothing else for that character that you want to get?I came from another loot base game called Destiny 2, and there the community complains a lot about good loots not being accessible.

none,"Idea for the introduction of the Chasm and Sumero as a playable area:A few months after the lantern rite, the Fatui signed a contract with Ningguang: their skirmishers will secure the Chasm and the way to Sumero (the Chasm is full of monsters, that's why it's closed for exploration now) since after Rex lapis pass the Milelith is stretched thin and cannot secure the area. Ningguang agrees to this contract because Sumero is a major trading country with Liyue and having the Chasm closed for too long is harmful to all sides. The Fatui's condition is that they can escort merchants and supplies through the Chasm without competition.When we explore the Chasm, there will be supply points set up by the skirmishers, similar to camps in the Dragonspine area. The fatui will be friendly in this area and there can be NPCs at the camps resting. The main enemies in the Chasm will be hilichurls and slimes.The Fatui is also present in Sumeru, similar to Mondstadt and Liyue, and they are plotting to get the gnosis.5\* character: The Fatui Skirmisher Commander.He'll be a cryo catalyst user and looks like a pyro sniper skirmisher. Instead of using the catalyst to attack, his rifle takes power from the catalyst weapon hanging on his back to shoot. His normal attack is just shooting, and his charge attack will be aim-shot like bow users, but he can straight up shoots cryo bullet without charging up.The Commander will be in charge of the Fatui at the Chasm and will assist us in getting to Sumero."

Knowing ahead of time the date I got proactive about it and went to my supervisor to get the formalities rolling as I know some things take time. So he got me the RFI forms to have the surgeon fill out. So the day of my surgery I had the surgeon fill them out and I emailed them to the 3 emails I was asked to forward it to (HR, AMCARE, and Accommodations Teams) that same day. I received an email from accommodations team the next day saying they needed a few other forms filled out and I got them done and sent in the same day. The surgeon recommended I take 1 week off work then recommended 1 month of sit down duties (in writing on the forms). On the day I was supposed to return to work (1 week post surgery) I was turned away at the doors because the accommodations team still hadn't gotten in contact with the site to arrange accommodations and I had to wait for a response to myself from them before I could return. Now I have missed an extra weeks worth of work and pay and after 2 days of calling and emailing the accommodations team still have yet to hear from them. I'm not worried about the attendance points or anything let them rack up and let them try to say something. I just want to get back to work so I can pay my bills and feed my family.Any thoughts on how to progress this faster??Thanks in advance"

But if I restart the laptop with the cord and headphones plugged in upon startup sound will route through them until unplugged (and go back to speakers) and if replugged in the sound wont divert again to the headphones untill restarted again.Edit: Being a Techy guy I felt ashamed I had only tried 1 method.... since I have tried with 2 other pairs of (wired) headphones (1 from my phone and a gaming pair I own) and also with another Aux Mic cord I have all (re)produce that same issue and results as posted above
none,"I have mentioned this in a few streams and with people  i play with but i think we need some kind of crafting/recalibration that rewards those of us willing to grind for the best of the best.What i think/Believe is that we should be able to roll more attributes or like 1 attribute AND 1 talent onto a gear piece. I think they should take say the Improvised gear set and just make it X attributes 2 talents and X mod of your choice. Now im not suggesting these be in any way cheap i say make it max materials to craft and max materials to recalibrate, at least then we could feel validated and in some sense satisfied with our builds. I know i would grind longer and harder if i could do this."

none,"So I pretty much just started playing Elite Dangerous. I only played a couple hours (on an xbox contrller) before getting a HOTAS flight stick, but the default controls for it are just awful, and I have no idea what anything in the bindings menu means since I've barely put any time into the game yet. My main issue is that a good portion of the controls are set to keys on the keyboard, and in VR I can't see the keyboard, so I'd have to take off the VR headset to use any of those controls. I spent a few hours trying to bind my own controls but couldn't even come close to anything playable.Pretty much, I'm looking for a control scheme that uses the Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas X Flight Stick with no keyboard or mouse controls whatsoever, or at least something that mainly uses the flight stick."
none,"So like the title says, I bought Elite Dangerous and whenever I try to login with the launcher it gives me the message ""Please purchase/redeem Elite Dangerous to continue.""I've looked all over the Frontier and Oculus sites and never seem to have been sent any kind of key. Not through emails, notifications, or anything. On the Frontier site supposedly I should have the key in the ""Partner Keys"" tab or my account but it says that I haven't purchased any games eligible for partner keys. The receipt from Oculus (the only email that Oculus sent to me) had nothing relating to a key or code. I tried uninstalling the game and re-installing it but I'm still getting the issue. I already sent a ticket to Frontier but would prefer not to have to deal with the long wait that goes into customer support tickets. The frontier site doesn't let me link my account to anything other than Steam, which obviously doesn't do anything since I didn't buy the game off of Steam. I don't seem to be the only one with this issue though I've never seen any answers to this other than to get a refund and buy it on steam or the frontier store. Really seems like a ripoff to offer the game on the Oculus store if it's impossible to access it after buying it from there.Update: Frontier's customer support told me to refund the game and get it either on Steam or their store, so I guess buying this game off the Oculus store is nothing but a waste of time."

I sent a support ticket 4 days ago and still haven't gotten a response, I've tried doing one of those support chats and was just told that they'd email me (which still hasn't happened).

I'm really not sure how I'm supposed to get my hands on one of these headsets if they don't want my money."

It doesn't show up in the device manager, and hovering over the adapter's software tells me ""no RTL818x"".Uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers did not work."

none,"I just recently decided to play the game through on hard mode.  While I still technically haven't beaten it (stuck on hell) I've decided to make a sort of ""strategy guide"" on how to get through the game on hard mode, so here it is.When it comes to playing through the levels, I found it best just to take it slow and try your best not to get hit.  The level's themselves aren't what make this mode so difficult, it's the bosses.Balrog (mimiga village) - You can just skip it, but it's a very easy fight either way so you do you.Igor - Also a pretty easy fight, I'd wait for him to jump before jumping over him and shoot the projectiles.I'd like to note that grabbing the Bubbler at this point does prove extremely useful for a lot of upcoming bosses, I highly recommend getting it.Balrog (bushlands) - I found that the level 3 Bubbler made the projectiles a bit easier to deal with.  If you think you can land some Fireball shots I'd go for it.  Towards the end of the fight keep in mind the Balrog starts to do normal jumps instead of flying.Balfrog - Again I find the Bubbler to be useful here for killing the small frogs and also avoiding the boss.  The fireball should be used to deal most of the damage to the boss, as well as for killing any remaining frogs.  The projectiles that the boss shoots out can be mostly cleared out with the Bubbler.Curly - The weapon of choice is definitely the Fireball.  I tried to take out the mimiga first, and then keep their bodies in front of Curly whenever possible, this way the Fireball would kill them the second they regain consciousness.You can take the Machine gun if you want, I personally went for the Spur so the rest of this guide will assume you still have the polar star.Omega - The Bubbler makes this boss a joke.  Just use the bubbles to deal with the projectiles and damage the boss.  You can get some Fireball shots in on the boss but I mostly used the Bubbler.Rabbid Toroko - I mostly stayed along the ground and ran under the boss whenever he jumped.  I used the Fireball mainly for both damage and taking out the enemies.  Keep in mind that you'll be forced to jump over some of the blocks he throws.Pooh Black (ghost balrog) - The level 3 Blade does a lot of damage to this boss, so I'd definitely be using that.  Whenever the boss jumps, I waiting in place for a second or two before running to make sure I had room to avoid him.  The game will try to throw some annoying projectiles at you before he lands so don't wait for too long.  Also after killing the boss, don't try to jump over him, he does damage to you even after death.Monster X - Okay this boss is a tough one.  In the hallway before starting the boss, I switched between the blade and the bubbler to take out most of the enemies (bubbler for the flying ones mostly).  I'd try to take advantage of the bubblers range to take out as many enemies as possible before starting the fight.  Once the fight starts I used the blade to take out the remaining enemies as quickly as possible.  During the fight I'd jump between the tires until it opens up.  Use the level 3 blade once or twice (from the side, don't drop in to the middle between the tires) and then run away and use the bubbler to deal with the projectiles (for that I put complete trust into the bubbler, I got a few feet away from the boss, faced him, and held down the fire button until all of the projectiles were gone, it never killed me once from doing that).  Rinse and repeat until phase two.  In this phase, when he opens up drop into the middle and hit is as many times as you can with the blade.  Afterwards try to avoid the projectiles while hitting them with either the Polar Star or the Bubbler.  I found the Bubbler useful here, but you can't just stand around with it like you could in phase one.  Hopefully you can kill him after a few waves of that.Core - This is probably the hardest boss in the game on hard mode.  For this I HIGHLY suggest leveling down your blade to an early level 2, you can do this in the previous room by only hitting the small fuzz's since they deal 1 damage.  The level 3 blade tends to just allow projectiles through it, it's very frustrating so level 2 is the way to go.  Once the battle starts, instantly head for the front most platform.  There should be two blocks there, a low one on the left and a slightly higher one on the right.  I found the first set of projectiles can always be avoided by landing on the left block, waiting for the first two projectiles to pass over you, then jumping to the right block right afterwards to completely avoid the rest of the projectiles.  When the boss opens up, you can get a good amount of Polar Star shots in before having to deal with the projectiles.  Switch to the level 2 blade and drop to the larger low platform.  If you're close to the left, you can pretty much just stand there and shoot the projectiles with the blade as they come, moving to the left and right when necessary, very rarely needing to jump (I'd try to avoid jumping when possible).  After the projectiles are all dealt with, spam the polar star on the boss.  When he pushes you back, try to get to the staircase as fast as possible and slowly jump up the stair one by one.  Doing that most of the time avoids the large projectiles altogether, though sometimes you'll need to jump over them.  From there I'd go to the platform before the one you were originally standing on at the beginning of the fight.  It's possible to get back to the original platform but it's difficult and probably not worth the effort.  From there you can apply the same strategies until the end of the fight, so good luck there, and don't forget to grab the tow rope.Ironhead (fish boss) - Mostly just use the Polar star to deal with the fish.  The fish only start to do damage when they turn into pufferfish so mainly focus on avoiding the blocks and shooting the fish.  When the boss starts to swim backwards, you can get a lot of level 3 blade hits into him dealing a lot of damage.  Don't try to get greedy and hit him while he's swimming forward, just to be safe.At this point a lot of the bosses use the Spur so if you chose to take the machine gun or snake then idk, just hit them a lot I guess.Sisters - they don't existMa Pignon - Shoot a lot of level 3 or fully charged spur shots while grounded and avoid the falling boulders.  Nothing much else to say on this one.That dog gives you a health upgrade, very useful!Red Ogre - Spur shots help here, you can kind of do the same strategy that you used on Rabbid Toroko but with the spur instead of the fireball, you might need to jump for some projectiles but that's easier with the booster 2.0.Misery - For the early phases, standing under her and shooting the spur seemed to be the easiest way of dealing damage.  I typically avoided to the left and right whenever she was about to teleport since the blocks one shot you.  I pretty much ignored killing the red bats when I could avoid them.  Well timed spur shots will quickly kill her.Doctor - For phase 1, fully charged spur shots kill him very quickly.  The red crystal can be annoying when it comes to landing those shots though.  If he does his burst shot attack, just stand far away and avoid the projectiles, keep in mind he still shoots his grounded projectile so you might want to use the booster to dodge higher up.  For phase 2, quickly charge shots to level 3 (not maxed out) to kill him quickly.  If you're fast enough, you can kill him before he shoots any bats, if he does shoot bats the just try to shoot the spur through them.  The Bubbler might be useful for that attack but I never tested it.I'd like to note that you can talk to Chako (the purple mimiga) twice to spawn hearts if you need them.Undead Core - Focus on killing Misery before anything else, if she stays alive long enough she eventually spawns in some very annoying to avoid projectiles.  After misery you can go for Sue.  Once their both dealt with you can start shooting spur shots at the core.  Jumping from platform to platform tends to be easier then staying grounded.  The projectiles themselves aren't too difficult to avoid so it should be quick.After this point, I've yet to beat hell because of one room in particular, so I can't really give any tips on fighting the hell bosses.  I can however tell you that the second room with the falling blocks is made a little bit easier by taking it slow, using the bubble to take out the enemies, and relying on some serious luck to avoid the blocks.  Once you've killed all the enemies up to the bump in the middle of the room, I just try to rush towards the end of the room.  If you're lucky enough to get past that room without dying I'd seriously try to take the rest of hell slowly, killing every enemy.  Good luck.&#x200B;If you have any other tips or strategies that were different from mine then go ahead and share them, there isn't really that many guides for hard mode out there so yay."

It's kind hard for me to explain what I mean because it's late and English isn't my native language so I'll try with an example.

When you do that, you give a short period of time for other players to join in for a chance to kill that Hilichurl with you.

none,"So I finally finished analyzing the data and I'm ready to share the results and conclusions.  (Not the usual original content you're used to but definitely worth it)# Background:I wanted to do something for the community and I was curious to know how high people got in the Spiral Abyss, so I took it a step further.  I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at TAU (Tel Aviv University). This semester I'm taking Database system course. We were given a home exercise to analyze data in Sakila database just to get us familiar with SQL, queries etc.  I thought it would be a good exercise to get even more familiar with SQL and gain a bit more knowledge.# Technical information:Created a poll using Google Forms.The option ""Collect Email addresses"" was disabled during the whole time the poll was running.The option ""Limit to 1 response"" was enabled to prevent false data (which is why people had to sign in to answer the poll).295 participants answered the poll.Analyzing the data was done in Google Sheets (which of course was easy to process and convert from Google Forms).Analyzing & processing the data was done by simple manipulations and queries on the data table.I tried to verify as much data as I can:For example when pulling all the people and grouping them by World Level, I checked their answers made sense, and by that I mean(floor reached – 1) \* 6 < total amount of stars <= (floor reached) \* 9since you have to get 6 stars to get to the next floors and you can't get more than 9 stars per floor.Another important thing to mention is that I used gray in the charts since I wanted to be more considerate for people who use dark mode but white wouldn't be good since they are people who don't use it so gray was the best option.# Some personal words:I really put a decent amount of hours in this since it's the first time I'm doing anything like it so getting familiar with the different platforms, functions and commands took some time. I've tried to come up with some interesting questions so I can do the queries accordingly. If you guys have some ideas for more questions I'll be glad to hear. I would even love to get a constructive criticism just don't be mean since there's a lot of effort here.The moment has come so let's dive into the results.# Results:1. First let's look at the distribution of people in the different Spiral Abyss floors.https://preview.redd.it/a1fmnw0xgqw51.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=7636079e72f8a1a5f12e4c8ddc02a3b24ded2bbbSurprisingly, more than half of the players are in the higher levels of the Abyss\\pushing towards them. To be precisely, 48.9% of the players are at floor 8 and 16.7% of the players are in the higher levels. Don't let that discourage you if you're still at the lower levels!Basically this chart shows that more then half of the players are in the higher levels and less then half in the lower ones. We can conclude this means that less than half of the players are relatively new to this game which is surprising.Let's dive a little deeper to see who are the players in the highest Spiral Abyss floor which is of course floor 8 (not talking about the Spiral Moon Spire).2. Floor 8 – World Distribution (129 Participants)https://preview.redd.it/fhnmii1zgqw51.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=667b1551dda38cd9081abb859037269b3304e7aaThis chart ratifies my conclusion.  47.3% of the players that reached floor 8 are at World Level 4 which means between level 35 and 39. We can all agree this is no easy task as for now. Let's not forget the large portion of people that are at World Level 5 which is a difficult task (levels 40-44). Hats off to the 14% of World Level 3 who managed to get to floor 8, absolutely amazing!Let's now take a look at the World Level distribution at the Spiral Moon Spire shall we?3. Spiral Moon Spire – World Distribution (282 participants)https://preview.redd.it/1kxy1j70hqw51.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e6c1c198cc029bf4e1688a4bb9822597557623Well there goes all World Level 3 players. You did good!  This does show how much dedication you need to get to real endgame (there are more surprises and even bigger ones, trust me).  61.3% of the players haven't reached yet to floor 9! This proves that the Spiral Moon Spire is one of the  most challenging things currently in the game. Now we'll take a closer look at the players who already reached there.4. Spiral Moon Spire – World Distribution (109 participants among the people who reached it)https://preview.redd.it/zzckkdb1hqw51.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=57d03ef6130a10bdfb133607ed053a8a771d7f8aBasically, entry ticket to the Spiral Moon Spire is getting to World Level 5.  This really shows how hard this is. Even if you got skills and luck, chances you going to reach the higher floors in pretty slim. 12.8% to be exact and that's only after you reached World Level 4.  Another amazing thing here is the fact that out of almost 300 people, only 2, yes, 2 people are at World Level 6 (levels 45-49).  This had me really curios while writing this so I went back to a post I made on reddit asking people what World Level they're at. I'm not even kidding the results are shocking, astounding, unpredictable  and  I don't have enough synonyms for the word surprising.5. World Level Distributionhttps://preview.redd.it/zcc969a2hqw51.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=5856378f02cb0965da015cc3e5b93cda4aa53729Excuse me dark mode users forgot to change the text's colorSeriously, take a look at this and say you're not surprised. I put only the first 5 values in a graph, and it shows the best fitting equation for the progress rate is polynomial. Meaning to get from WL X to WL X+1 you'll have to spend the amount of time you spent until WL X (let's call it Y) times Y (times 90 but that's not really the issue right now). For those of you who know mathematics you'll see that R square is almost 1. Basically, it means this is the true progression rate (the closer it is to 1, the better).https://preview.redd.it/noctf724hqw51.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=76fd0963227bf6dd06a1bb20a7fdaaa9d2e3b722Now when adding the 6th value  things go crazy. Since there's not enough data and values to decide what is the real progression rate after WL 5. It's like the difficulty spikes exponentially!  Now remember this data is more reliable. The sample is large! 3.1k participants!  Altogether, take it with a grain of salt. A lot of stuff affects the results. It could be the fact this was on reddit, on a specific time of the day etc etc. I took 2 courses of statistics and I'm trying not to remember what happened there so excuse me if I have some mathematical issues with the analysis. Now after seeing this, consider the data regarding WL 6 players is not completely true since out of 3.1k participants, only 63 were at WL 6 which is 2% and I got 2 out of 295 which is 0.07%.6. Let's take a look now at another interesting thing. The relation world level and average amount of stars at Floors 1-8https://preview.redd.it/816i9iw4hqw51.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=53a2847b4269700ee14e7f7df596bffa1822ff34Surprisingly the jump from WL 4 to 5 didn't help players gain more stars. We can see WL 4 and 5 players actually have almost the same amount of stars.  We do see it affects a lot when going from WL 2 to 3 and from 3 to 4.  For me personally, getting to WL 5 let me get 72 stars in the Abyss (however I don't remember how many stars I had before so I might be fitting in this statistic as well).7. Relation between world level and average amount of stars (Floors 9-12)https://preview.redd.it/iljvaz76hqw51.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=98191b8f24e2c075679d89913fad472b8c9acc18We can see that here being WL 5 helps you to gain more stars compared to the first 8 floors which makes me a bit confused but like I said, there are plenty of other factors (for example more fitting characters in floors 9-12 to players at WL 5 since they played longer and had more wishes).  We can see that the difference between WL 5 and 6 isn't big at all but since I didn't have enough players at WL 6 to participant in the poll, I would say this isn't correct.Summary:I hope you guys enjoyed and if I get enough support I will continue doing more stuff like this with your suggestions and ideas."

Only squirrels, Boars, some birds, crabs and fish (might missed 1 or 2 more animals). I just think adding more animals will make the world feel more alive. Maybe add fishing system, hunting system. I know there are plenty of other things that need to be worked on before those but just suggestion in general. Also a housing system will be dope imo."

none,"Ok 2 things that are really annoying in co op.1. I hate it when finally someone accept the co op invitation but then turns out the other player doesn't speak the same language. This could easily being prevented if near each user we had a flag icon indicating where the other player is from. 2. This one just grinds my gears. I really like to help players, old or new, I go to other people worlds when I'm bored and help them find countless secret chests, kill bosses, complete new achievements and I enjoy it. But when someone accepts my invitation when they are fighting a boss and then, after I one shot him (or just kill him very quickly), I get kicked or the other player just keeps playing like nothing happened."

none,"I decided I'll go and find all the chests/challenges and Seelies in the map using the interactive map.I probably missed few but I'm sure I got 99% of them plus quite a few that weren't in the map (not secret ones or puzzles etc, just one out there in the open without any marker in the interactive map).I started using the interactive map when I already collected **330** (+-) chests in Mondstadt and **710** (+-) in Liyue. Now I got to **450** in Mondstadt and **880** in Liyue.Got around 7k AR experience and in total it adds up to 26k (Assuming 20 AR per chest).  Also let's not forget about all the Mora I got from it. I really haven't paid attention to how much I got but there's the Mora you get straight from the chests when you open them and the Sigils which I believe got over 1k geo Sigils and 500 Anemo Sigils. That adds up to 1.2M  Mora which is insane!  So I encourage you guys to do the same and get more AR!Btw, go to [https://forums.mihoyo.com/genshin/article/57548](https://forums.mihoyo.com/genshin/article/57548) it's a post I made.

We dated for a few months 5/6 years ago and he has met some of my family then and met pretty much the remainder yesterday on Father's Day. I try not to talk too much about my parents to him but he knows some things.Anyway, we had a get together yesterday and as expected, the narcs exhibited their narc behavior. Overall they were pretty well behaved but there were certainly a few moments where I was like god I really do love this man for putting up with it.My parents are hardcore Trump supporters and my bf and I are closet Biden supporters but we have to act like we are Trump fans/voters and the conversation at one point turned to politics, which we are not political and we don't discuss politics to each other. Then my mother. Good god my mother. Now, my mom never knew her birth father and she worked feverishly over the past few years to find her long lost family. And I think the work she did is incredible but at the same token it's just another thing she has to bring up to call attention to herself and naturally she did. Out of nowhere she starts talking about one of her new sisters who was a cocaine addict and died of an overdose. It was really... Weird.When my boyfriend and I were texting later in the day he says ""the whole dead sister thing really threw me for a loop."" Any time any narc behavior came out during the cook out, I would squeeze his shoulder and he would brush my leg. I just adore him so much that he was there to help me get through the day. I love that we hate the same things."

none,"I listen to a morning show on the radio and they were doing a segment on like how your kids embarrass you as a parent. I called in with a story about my daughter and I at a Chinese restaurant and she yelled out really loud ""Hey mom! Did you faaaaaaart?!"" I didn't but still... Oh my goodness sakes. Lol. So I won a 4 pack of tickets to see Peppa Pig live in concert. I took my mom, my daughter and her friend. The kids were 4 I believe when I won.So the 4 of us venture out to Chicago, about an hour's drive, to see PP live. We were all actually really excited and the kids hadn't experienced a live show like this. We had great seats too, so that added to the experience.Anyway, it was the dumbest.lamest.worst thing you could have ever seen. I understand the show is for children but it was so unbelievably bad.The characters were basically a giant puppet with a puppeteer dressed in black behind it controlling it. The puppets rolled on wheels to get around with the puppeteer pushing it. The dialogue was just so bad. The music was terrible. It was just so fucking terrible.Then at the 20 minute mark, they paused for an intermition (dafuq??) and when they came back, after like 15 minutes it was clear it was wrapping up very soon.The kids were bored AF and wanted to leave. We left. We drove the hour back home. 2 hours worth of travel to watch 30-something minutes of live PP garbage.I write this as my daughter is watching PP right now and I don't hate it. I actually kind of like it. But the live show. Fuck. It was terrible."

none,"I was in 6th grade, so like 12 or so? I was wearing a semi permanent retainer and had to go to my orthodontist weekly or every other week for adjustments. My orthodontist was in his late 60s early 70s or so.One day I was in my appointment and my orthodontist and another patient, sounded like a middle aged man, were in the room next to mine. They were talking very explicitly about young girls, aged 12-16ish in extremely graphic sexual tones and how it was just oh so tough to control themselves around them. I was horrified. I listened for a minute or two but couldn't take it anymore and ran back to the lobby in tears.My mom asked me what was wrong and I was screaming that the ortho and the guy were talking about underage girls. It freaked me out. I begged my mom to take me out of there, which she did. The receptionist had the audacity to say ""Well maybe he didn't know you were in the room!""My mom took me out of there and we never went back."

I know they aren't mine because mine are slinky and these were not.I keep folding and pull out another pair of undies that are not mine. My squeeze is laughing at me asking if I checked the dryer. I said yes of course but how is there 2 undies not mine in here??So then, I pull out a THIRD thing of undies and by this point I'm like wth is going on cuz this is insane!!Well then it hit me.I bought undies on Amazon like 2 weeks prior that I opened and just threw in the laundry and hadn't washed so they had been sitting there.There were mine all along. 🤦"
none,"About 10 years ago, I had my first apartment by myself. It wad an old building (and has since been torn down) and had carpet in the kitchen *and* bathroom.My first week living there, I exhausted all my money on moving and spent my last couple bucks buying a frozen pizza and a bag of chicken tenders. It was a Home Run Inn pizza too and those are 💣.I pulled the pizza out to the top of the pizza box and lost my balance and the pizza tumbled cheese side down right into the carpet. I fell to my knees and cried and cursed. I carefully lifted the pizza away but there was no salvaging anything besides some random spots of crust.It took forever to clean and of course, the grease spread, making the stain much bigger. It sat that way for the whole year I lived there, but eventually did start lightening up."
none,"I was running a physical therapy office and I got one of the strangest phone calls I've ever had. I still think it was someone punking me, but you never know...This woman called, sounded like mid 40s/early 50s and tells me she needs to get set up for PT and wants to come to our clinic in, we'll call the town ""A"" but she lives in town ""B"", apart 15 miles or so from where we are. I tell her that there's a clinic in town B that would be closer to her. She says that she won't go there because it's a ""rough"" town. I tell her that if she thinks town B is rough, she really won't like it in town A because it's rougher over here. And of course, it's far out of her distance.She says she doesn't care and wants to come to us. Okay, I continue gathering info and she starts asking questions about what to expect and so forth. She asks me if there will be privacy. I tell her that we are mostly open concept like a gym but we can draw curtains/private areas for more invasive treatment. She says she has to have a woman because she's a born again Christian and can't have a man looking at her or putting his hands on her. I tell her we have women therapists here.Then she asks me the ages of the therapists and says she just cannot have someone who is younger than her and has to have someone who is a seasoned pro. I explain that all of our therapists are seasoned/experienced and really great here, but yes we have someone who is ""older"" and more ""motherly.""Then she asks me what race the therapist is and as I'm trying to hide my disgust at the question, I say she is white and several patients hear this and I hear the murmurs of ""...the hell?"" Then the next question is if there is a facebook for physical therapists.After this 20 something minute phone call, she declines to schedule. It was really weird all around."
none,"I was on the call with a health insurance rep and it stuck out at me because his name is the same as my cat. While we're talking, I hear a bunch of roosters cockadoodling in the background. The more I hear it, the more I laugh. The rep apologized and said his neighbor had a bunch of roosters. He then proceeds to tell me this story:Back when the pandemic was starting to get bad, my neighbor thought he would be smart and get chickens for few dollars each to have a supply of meat and eggs... Well, the joke is on him because all of the chickens are boys!I laugh and he continues.So for Thanksgiving, my neighbor has an idea to cook up one of the roosters. He does, and let me tell ya, it was soooo dry and tough! I say oh my goodness, that's probably why we don't eat roosters!He finishes his story and said now he's surrounded by roosters who never shut up."
none,"I work in a small corporate medical billing office. Our day to day operations within the office is about 15 women. We only have one man in our office occasionally which is the owner. He comes in every other month or so for a day or two and was in this week for meetings.Today he had a big meeting, which ultimately sealed a huge new contract between our company and another. Anyway, it was a group of 4 men, the owner, and the 2 ladies of HR. The men individually arrived today between 10:50 and 11:10.Some time between man 3 and 4, I went to use the bathroom. I walk in and the toilet seat is up. Ok... I grab a paper towel and go to put it down when I see there is piss on the rim and a puddle of piss on the floor. Now clearly it wasn't any of the women here and the owner is certainly not going to piss on the floor... So one of these guys here to negotiate a contract pisses on the bathroom floor and leaves it. Unbelievable.My first instinct is to just turn around and leave it but I cannot in good conscience do that so I reluctantly clean it up. I go back and tell my cubicle mate what has happened. Later on, I tell one of the HR ladies that was within the meeting and she was dumbfounded. Then she hilariously started analyzing each of the guys within the group and thinks she might know who it may have been.But seriously, how do you walk into a corporate office to sign a huge contract and just piss on the bathroom floor like an animal? Just truly disgusting."
none,"A few years ago, I accumulated debt.Significant debt. Life destroying debt.It finally caught up with me and I was about to be sued. Being sued means being garnished. And not only was I about to be sued, I had another lawsuit filed against me. I had 2 creditors suing me. It was devastating. I was about to be destroyed financially.I contacted an attorney that was highly recommended to me. I started out with a Ch. 13 so I could keep my car. I went through the whole process, paid my fees, and went through the hearing with the trustee and started my repayments. However, 'rona hit and my car literally fell apart and died. I was about to lose my tax return as part of the bankruptcy agreement. I needed a new car and really needed my tax return to stay with me to buy a new one. I called my attorney to figure out what to do.We purposely defaulted on the chapter 13 and surrendered the car, which was now dead/didn't drive. A crew came and picked up the car free and clear. I found out I was being laid off in July. I was able to keep my tax return and used that to buy a new car. We refiled as a chapter 7. It was discharged a few days ago.Despite being bankrupt and losing my job, I have managed to turn my financial situation around. I got a better job. With the multiple stimulus checks and my tax return this year that I did not have to surrender, I am officially debt free. I have nothing hanging over my head. I actually have money left over and am able to save money. I can live again. I can breathe. My anxiety is almost non existent. I just bought a brand new piece of furniture for the first time ever - paid in cash, with money left over. It makes me want to cry happy tears."

She replied one word: sorry (which I know only translates to ""fuck you."")Yesterday, my daughter tells me that my mom is still smoking in the car with her and told my daughter ""don't tell your mom."" This made my blood fucking boil. So I told my dad yesterday about this and he said he'd have a talk with her.I came by today to get my daughter and my dad tells me to sit down and my mom looked all confused. He told her that she needs to stop prodding my daughter (that's a whole 'nuther story) then he brings up the smoking.And what does she do? Fucking lies about it. Said it didn't happen. Crazy fucking lying bitch doing what she does best. Lies. Nothing but fucking lies and gaslighting. I jumped up and said ""You know what? Fuck you! This is why I hardly come around!"" Then she started her manipulative bullshit and I kept shutting her down telling her how toxic and manipulative she is and she needs to stop playing the victim.I feel pretty good about it for now.I'm waiting for the ""I'm sorry I'm such a bad mother"" text to come through.Crazy.fucking.bitch."

I was hoping he'd fall asleep and pass but he tried to get up to drink or potty and he couldn't. He fought til the end. I took him to the vet and there were no options available for us. I had to put him down. My lil dude. He was such a stinker but he brought so much joy and happiness to me and my daughter. Always wanted to be around, always wanted to play, kept me company in my bath and checked on me every morning after my shower. He always greeted us without fail when we came home. He had a 14 inch tail that he loved to whip around.I buried him with my daughter's blankie. He used to ""fuff"" on it. (We calling it ""fuffing"" when he'd make his biscuits and he'd nurse on it. It was weirdly disgusting but it was a part of who he was.) My daughter is on vacation with her grandma and coming home tomorrow so I'm telling her tomorrow night when she gets home.I thought lil dude was gonna be with us for a long time. He was only. 1 1/2 years. I thought he'd grow into an old boy with us. I feel like we just got to know him. We got him at 6 weeks old. Just a little nugget. He was loved. I will miss him very much."
none,"I have lived in my place for 3 1/2 years. I am a damn good tenant. I pay my rent on time, take care of the rental, and never ask for anything. My landlord is a lazy bum and everyone in the property hates him.I took a huge income loss over the past couple months due to Covid. I've been lucky enough that I was able to get various forms of assistance from food stamps to a grant from my work to energy assistance. I found out I was eligible for rental assistance so I applied. I received a message from the housing authority on Aug 12 that they were going to proceed with my application but they would need some forms filled out by the landlord.The problems started with him right away when I told him that I had papers for him to sign. First, he actually questioned the validity of the application. I said it's from the state, the housing authority. Then he made multiple excuses for not filling it out from ""the library wasn't open for me to print"" to ""I don't know how to answer some of these"" to ""I don't normally fill these out unless someone is in arrears."" Just friggin shut up and fill it out.After several weeks of excuses, I knew time was ticking and they'd wind up withdrawing my application. I emailed the rep from the housing authority that I had been working with and told her that on numerous dates, I contacted the landlord and he has been non-compliant. I left his name and phone number.The housing authority called him and told him he needs to comply. So he came by that night and filled the papers out, of course, complaining the whole time. I submitted everything the next morning. Within hours, i got a response saying I was granted the max of $2000 in rental assistance and is being deposited to my landlord within a few days. With the subsidy, my rent is going from $750 to $250 for the next 4 months. I'm being laid of next week but got hired for my dream job and am starting the week after. This rental assistance will help tremendously while I transition jobs.Thanks for the gold!"
none,"I work for a big name physical therapy company who has decided to let all their front office, along with other positions go. They announced this in July and next Friday is my last day. It was a devastating blow. I've been there almost 3 years and I really liked the job.Over the past few weeks, I have been busting my butt applying for jobs, interviewing before and after work, and still running my office full time. It has been exhausting. I applied for this job for insurance verification, which I really wanted to do if I had the option to move up at my current job. I was really excited when I saw the listing and was so happy when the recruiter reached out for a phone interview.I didn't hear from them for a few weeks but the boss lady called me last week for a face to face. I really liked her a lot and still wanted the job. Well, after another week of waiting, I GOT THE JOB I WANTED. I signed on with them yesterday. I got what's really my dream job - exactly what I wanted to do career-wise, the highest paying job I've ever had, and a laid back environment that doesn't care about tattoos or hair color and allows you to wear jeans, and bonus: no more dealing with the public. I start after Labor Day and am so happy.My hard work paid off!"
none,"I wrote a couple posts before about having some very dismissive doctors. I saw a post over on r/gatekeeping about how ""men shouldn't be gynecologists."" My ob/gyn is a man and he's the best doctor I've ever had.I suffered from terrible, debilitating periods for years. I'm talking golfball or bigger sized clots, high fevers, and cramps that would keep me bedbound for days. This happened for years. I saw a doctor in 2009 who gave me a D&C. That helped but when I got pregnant with my daughter, the aftermath was even worse.I had moved further away from that doctor (who I really did like and was able to help me) and got pregnant later. I needed to find a new gyno, so I googled who was nearby and just started going down the list. The 1st doctor didn't see pregnant women until they were so-many weeks pregnant. Next one didn't answer their phone. Next one only did gynecology but no obstetrics. The last one I called was, who we'll call Dr. W., able to get me in pretty quickly.On my first visit, before going into the exam room, Dr. W. took me into his actual office and sat down with me and got to know me. Asked about my lifestyle, job, family, etc. We had a nice conversation. I felt very comfortable. I then got my first prenatal exam. He was gentle, informative, and made me feel at ease. I began to look forward to going to him.My pregnancy was great. I told Dr. W. I planned to be sterilized after my baby was born. At 28 with only one child, it's hard to find a doctor who will honor your wishes for sterilization. Dr. W. gave me ZERO hassle for it. We had options for my sterility, and it would depend on what kind of birth I would have. I wound up having a c-section, so I got my tubes removed.During my hospital stay, Dr. W. came to visit me twice. Each time, he stayed with me for a while and just chatted with me. It was like having an old friend come to visit. I was teasing him because he was wearing jeans and a sweater, no lab coat. ""Is it casual Friday?"" I asked. Ever since I've known him, he wears Birkenstocks with socks (lol) and was again rocking those.After my daughter was born and my periods started returning, they came back with a vengeance. I was having more accidents as an adult than when I first started. I would put a super plus tampon in and soak through it to my knees in 20 minutes. It was horribly embarrassing. I called Dr. W's office and asked just to come in to talk to him. For the first time in my life, I was not forced to have any kind of exam or jump through hoops just to have a simple conversation with the doctor. He took me into his office and we talked. He said he had a 20 minute surgery that would change my life.I had an endometrial ablation and have been period free for 6+ years now. When he said it would change my life, he wasn't lying. Every year I go in for my pap, he asks me how the ablation is holding up. I tell him every year that I cannot begin to thank him enough. He just ""aw, shucks"" me. I had my annual visit last week and he told me since he's been doing more ablations, his hysterectomy rate is way down.I have been to some horrible doctors who don't listen or don't care or both. Dr. W. is by far the best doctor I have ever had. I am eternally grateful for everything he has ever done for me."

There's zero incentive for me to go in with a happy face and a can-do attitude. And now I have to do it for 8 more weeks. I've worked the entire pandemic without complaint.

none,"I had received a notice from a law firm saying there was a class action suit pending for a bill collector who was doing illegal things. I had to send back a little postcard with my info on it and basically just sit and wait for the litigation to end. I had gotten one of these before for a class action suit against T-mobile a few years ago. I got a check for like $7. No big deal. I just need to send out a postcard verifying who I am.I get another notice in the mail months later. I open it up and there's a check and a message saying the suit had been settled. I open the check and it's for $247! I was so giddy. I know it's not huge, but I was going on vacation at the time, and this paid for a lot of it.If you ever get one of these, fill it out! It took 30 seconds of my time and a stamp. Come to think of it, the postage might have been paid on the postcard. Free money is amazing!"
none,My landlord is calling me almost daily telling me something is leaking or running from my apartment. There is nothing coming from my end (faucets are off tight and I use two shower curtains so there's no dripping). He just called me a few minutes ago to tell me my toilet is running when it isn't. I'm becoming very irritated because it's starting to become harassing.

none,"I took a few years of Spanish in middle and high school but I retained hardly any of it. If I'm reading it, I can mostly pronounce everything right and can kind of deduce what's going on.Anyway, we have a patient at work who doesn't speak English. His wife doesn't either. We had a girl who spoke Spanish, but she has since been furloughed due to c-19. I was volunteered to try to communicate with the patient the other day. I pulled up Google translate and was able to reschedule his appointment with no problem. I was speaking to him in person and I could tell he was kind of teasing me for my attempt to speak Spanish. We made it work though.Today his wife calls and again I was summoned to talk to her. It's a lot different doing it over the phone instead of in person. I pulled up Google and asked her to speak slowly so I could understand. I was totally able to get what she needed - that she was no longer leaving the house due to c-19 and needed her husband to go on hold. She seemed very understanding that I didn't actually speak Spanish and was doing my best.I relayed the phone call to the clinician. He told me I sounded like I had been speaking it for years. He said he was impressed I was able to do all of that, as he wouldn't have been able to pronounce any of it.I was seriously pleased with myself when all was said and done."
none,"Around 20 years ago, my friend had this song that I believe was on a punk/ska compilation. I don't know the artist or comp. The one thing I remember about the song, is it used some Muppets lyrics like the ""ma na min na doo doo doo doo doo ma na min na doo doo doo doo"". The verses were sung very fast. The singer had a high pitched voice (male singer.) I tried finding it years ago when the internet first became mainstream. I typed the lyrics I knew in a search and nothing came up. I can't remember the lyrics now."
none,"When I was in second grade, so like 8 years old, I became sick. Stomach cramps, general fatigue, and unbelievable pain in my side. My mom didn't even believe me. I was sick for about a week. She told me ""You're faking it to get out of cheerleading practice."" I told her no, I was really sick. Later that week, we were at her friend's house. I was drinking iced tea, when suddenly I fell over, clutching my side. My mom ran me to the emergency room, thinking it might be my appendix.We sat in the waiting room for hours before someone took us back. Appendicitis was ruled out quickly, but there was no real answer for what the illness was. I was sent for an ultrasound. They thought it may have been my gall bladder. I was told ""well since you don't have any stones, we don't really know what it is. Just take these blue pills and go home."" This was the start of 10 years of agony for me.I was sent to a dietician who put me on an ultra low fat diet. I was only allowed to eat things with 3g of fat in them or less. We followed the diet but it was really unsustainable and didn't help me with any symptoms at all. I started having debilitating gall bladder attacks numerous times a year. I was in and out of the hospital, urgent care, doctors offices. No one could or would help me. I kept getting brushed off because I ""had no stones.""I finally saw a doctor who ordered me this test called a HIDA scan, which takes a closer look at the gall bladder. It is a 3-4 hour scan where you are strapped to the table and cannot move. Once again, because I ""had no stones"", there was ""nothing wrong with me."" Meanwhile, I kept having gall bladder attacks, which kept getting worse.To describe the pain, it is a pain like you've never experienced. It's like being stabbed and beaten over and over again. It knocks the wind out of you. Nothing was stopping the attacks and no doctor was helping me. After years of suffering, the attacks were so bad, I was having what could basically be described as a bowel movement coming out of my mouth. The smell and taste was horrible. The thick yellow and brown gobs that I would vomit was the grossest, foulest thing ever. Still, no one would help me. This went on for 10 years. TEN YEARS of no one listening to me.My mom finally said she had enough and she took me to a surgeon she had used and begged him to help us. I was around 19 at this point. Doc ordered me another HIDA scan, but this time, he ordered a 2nd part to it called the ""ejection fraction."" This was not done in the first test. Basically, it's the extensive scan but you get 2 other injections with it. One is to light your organs up, one is to force them to squeeze to test their functionality. The injections made me so sick but since you're strapped to the table, I had to fight the urge to vomit. It was one of the most uncomfortable feelings ever. That night, I went to work and promptly became ill and wound up in the hospital yet again. While in the emergency room, they were able to get my results from the 2nd HIDA scan. I got the answer I waited 10 years to hear. My gall bladder was working at only 19%. I never had any gall stones, but my gall bladder was dying. 10 years of suffering, agony, hospital visits, and doctors who didn't listen, to find out my gall bladder was non-functional.I was promptly scheduled for surgery. As the doc was wheeling me in the room, he asked me if I was nervous. I said no way, this is one of the happiest days of my life. I had my surgery and it was a success. No more attacks! Unfortunately, I have some unpleasant side effects, such as chronic IBS. I'd take that any day of the gall bladder attacks though. People say gall bladder attacks are worse than childbirth. I can honestly say that's true. Childbirth lasts one day. This lasted for years. I had dozens of attacks.I'm 35 now and still consider my gall bladder surgery one of the happiest days of my life. It was a life changing experience. My quality of life became so much better. Stay tuned for the next chapter of doctors who don't listen."

none,"I work in an office. Our basic materials are provided for us, but I hate the cheap stuff. I have brought in my own supplies that I have paid for. I'm at the front desk and the other employees really have no business coming up to my area. However, they think it's fine to grab my pens and use them. I have asked them not to since I bought them. They roll their eyes and think it's not a big deal. But I do. It was bad enough at one point that I had to start counting my pens in the morning because I was constantly missing them. I moved my desk around and was able to mostly hide my cup of pens, but sometimes they'll still use them. When they use them, I never get them back. I find them laying all over the clinic. My other pet peeve is when they take my pens, use them, then just throw them on my desk instead of putting them in my cup. I know it's ridiculous to get worked up over pens, but I bought them. I'm very particular about what kind of pens I use. I have also ordered them tons of pens/markers/sharpies to use so there is no reason to take mine.Edit: there are no drawers to the desk. It's a glorified shelf. If there were drawers, of course I'd put them away.Edit for some clarifications: this is an open concept physical therapy clinic. My desk is in the front of the giant room and they are all behind me.  My work space is mine/front office. They don't know how to do my job and I don't know how to do theirs. They have no real business coming into my area. There are community pens set up in multiple places. My pens are tucked discreetly into the side. I moved the desk around and when I did, the pen theft subsided quite a bit. In fact, they would always steal my post its. I broke down and ordered these stupid phone message pads. They HATE them. I don't get my notepads stolen anymore.Two- yes I order supplies. No I am NOT allowed to order what is outside the companies we can order from and our lists are severely restricted. I used to have a touch more flexibility but corporate has cracked down hard so now everyone is punished. I bring my own stuff because I do not want to use the cheap stuff from Staples. I am very picky and certain pens works better in my hands and write nicer.Lastly - after 2 years on Reddit, I finally got a silver - over being an asshole for pens. 🖋🖋Thanks for the gold too! 🏅Thanks for the double gold! 🏅🏅"
none,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/d9tio0/imagine_being_this_agitated_over_750/So... I get a phone call today from our corporate office. The rep asks me if I know of this person and I say oh yes I am very familiar. She says he has called in again and spoke to 2 other reps who tell him you either pay or you don't get service. It's cut and dry.Well, just to be petty... He has decided to lay into me. He complained about my hair (dyed dark red), and my tongue ring (which you can't even see) and that I don't wear black pants (I wear a skirt and hose every day and the one time I wore pants, everyone was confused). He apparently went on a 20 minute rant personally attacking me. The rep wound up backing me up saying ""She has a right to dye her hair, the tongue ring isn't visible, and if she is out of dress code, it would have been addressed."" Then, he said that the person he spoke to in the office wasn't actually the director, just a fill in (which is 100% incorrect). I enjoyed every minute of this conversation. I found it to be very humorous that he's now complaining about me personally for no reason than just to be petty. Apparently he's going to come up here to speak to the ""real director"" and cancel his services.Adios, muchacho. Good riddance."
none,"I work for a nationwide physical therapy company as a front office coordinator. It's a good job and I have some great relationships with my patients. But this guy... Oh lord... This guy had become the thorn in my side recently.I had surgery over the summer and this particular patient had treated at my clinic while I was on leave. He came back right after I returned to work. I set up his account and as a courtesy, we have a team verify patient benefits. No matter how well benefits are explained, people can't grasp the concept that their insurance really sucks and therapy is very expensive.So benefits come back and dude has a very high deductible and high out of pocket maximum (which he'd already know since he's been here already) which he has met neither. Another stipulation to his insurance is he has a 30 visit limit *per episode* (which means he can come to therapy multiple times per year for multiple body parts) instead of 30 visit limit *per year* like most insurances. I explain this to him and he is convinced this is per year. I tell him this is what we are quoted and it is up to him to verify that the quote is true and accurate. He tells me to call his insurance. I tell him I cannot do that because our team has already been quoted and it is up to him now to verify his policy. Instead of calling his insurance, he calls his MD multiple times and says they need to request a peer to peer review and give all kinds of info to his insurance. Several members of the MD staff call me throughout the day because they're confused. I tell them they wouldn't even have anything to do with his insurance authorizations for physical therapy. I said I explained to patient what he was supposed to do and ask for. The MD has already done their part by giving the referall for PT. Now there are multiple hands in the cookie jar and people are becoming more and more confused. I finally give in and call his insurance again. Between myself and my assistant, we are on the phone for an hour, which is why we aren't supposed to call after benefits are originally quoted. We have a team for that and it takes time away from my office to sit on the phone all day like that. We verify everything once again and square it away and patient is scheduled and starts.As of September 23rd, our company has had a major change in policy. We have always been very lax in collecting co-pays. We realize someone who has a $50 copay is going to be hurting bad to be spending $600/month in copays to go to therapy. However, people are getting hit with huge bills after therapy ends because they don't understand how their insurance works and pays out and we are labelled the bad guys (YOU PICKED YOUR SHITTY INSURANCE, NOT US). So now we are demanding copays and partial payments towards co-insurance. Most people are paying somewhere around $20/visit when they walk in and being billed the rest. Almost all the patients who are now required to pay up front have taken it well and understand the policy...Except for this same dude.He comes in today and I stop him at the desk and explain to him about our new policy change and based on his insurance, he is required to pay $7.50 every time he comes in, which will apply to his overall bill. I hadn't had a chance to stop him when he was in earlier this week to tell him then, so today he would he required to pay $15 to be seen today.He more or less ignores me and starts to go into therapy. I tell him no, we cannot see you until you pay this. He argues and tells me that we are double billing him. I say no, this is a down payment to the final bill/there is no double billing. We argue some more and he tells me he's not paying. I tell him I'm getting my clinic director, who tells him the exact same thing. He argues with him and continues to refuse to pay. He walks out of the clinic and comes back a few minutes later. He asks if he can still be treated today. I say you can when you pay the $15. He said he called the corporate office who says they are waiving the payment. I say I cannot proceed until I get confirmation of that. The phone rings a minute later. It's the corporate office who says they have taken a very upset phone call from this guy. Rep says she explained to him that this is new company policy and he is required to pay like every other doctor's appointment now. So dude blatantly lied to me. I call the director over again and tell him that was corporate and what they said. Director talks to dude again and says this is policy. Dude still refused and ultimately left and looks like will he discharged.All over $7.50."

none,"https://imgur.com/a/i4zBtovStarting from upper left: #1 xray 5/7/19. #2 top view 6/5/19. #3 side view - permanent sore at the joint. #4 night of surgery. #5 five days post op top view. #6 five days post op side view - sore nearly gone. #7 7/31/19 top view. #8 8/22/19 side view - sore gone. #9 before and after.I first realized how bad my bunions were when I broke my foot at 19 years old. The xrays were shocking. So I started researching getting them fixed. I did not like what I was reading though. Recovery seemed to be a long and painful process.Around 30 years old, I saw a foot doctor. He took one look at my foot and said due to the severity, he couldn't help me. I was referred to a foot surgeon who wanted to do an open base wedge bunionectomy. His process would have permanent hardware along with a hard cast to knee for 3 months, boot for 3 months, sneaker for 3 months. O started going through his protocol for bloodwork and a physical to prepare for surgery. However I had to delay it all because I was between jobs and just couldn't afford it.I'm now 35. I saw my new foot doctor on 5/7/19. I knew going in it would be a ""when"" versus ""if"" for surgery. His process would be a close wedge bunionectomy with removable hardware, partial removable cast for a month, boot for a month, then sneaker for a month.I had my surgery on 6/6/19 on my right foot. I am extremely happy with the results. The first 5 days post op, I had to leave the entire wrap and cast on. It was removed at my 5 day post op appointment. I cried when I saw my new foot. I think it's beautiful. At that point, I could remove the wraps and cast but had to leave the bandages on and keep dry. Doc took xray at this visit. I used a rolling knee walker for this first month and was totally non weight bearing.The second post op appointment came 10 days after that just to check incision, infection and all that which came out good. Stitches were removed and gave clearance to wash foot/soak/get wet. I got to see my xray before and after to see the real progress. The xray speaks for itself.14 days after that, 3rd appointment. Pins removed. Received an air cast. Hated the air cast. Have to put a bunion splint on first, then wrap tight with ace bandage, then the air cast which is inflated. Received clearance to drive and walk. No lie, walking is *excruciatingly* painful and slow going. Was not expecting it to hurt this much. Air cast is a gigantic pain in the ass with driving because of the on-off-inflate-deflate sequence. I hardly went anywhere because it's just too much of a pain. Each day I'm moving a little better though. Some days would be extremely painful and exhausting then the next day I'd rest. Then next day work as hard as tolerated.8/2/19 received clearance to wear sneakers. It's awkward to walk. Still very painful and slow. Swelling still present but has subsided. At this point I discussed going back to work. Doctor clears me to return in a few weeks.8/19/19 returned to work. Wearing dress shoes to work (ssssssh). I opted to start this week in half days to ease back into it. First couple days are exhausting and minimally painful. Now I'm feeling pretty good. Still some pain but nothing unbearable. However when I start walking, I go and want to go normal like my brain is telling me to but my body is like whoaaaa slow down. I'm still on the slow side, there's some minimal pain, and I don't have full range of motion in my big toe yet. I'm *almost* healed up but I still have limitations. Grass, sand, and gravel are still hard to walk on. Stairs and curbs are still tough.Seeing the foot doc for final appointment on 9/4/19. I feel really good about my surgery and love my new foot. It has been a slow process. It has been extremely painful and exhausting and I'll have to do it all over again. Now I know what to expect. I would absolutely do it again. I love my new foot."

none,"When I was somewhere between 3 and 4, my mom got me a little plastic squirtgun. You know, something you'd get out of the 25 cent machine at Kmart. It had one of those little plastic cap plugs.  I took it off put it in my mouth, my ear, basically any orifice that a dumb little kid would put stuff in.I stuck it in my nose and it became lodged. I walked into my mom's room. I pointed up and said ""It's up here.""My mom said ""What's up here?"" I pointed up and repeated my statement. She was really confused but eventually it was figured out I had lodged the cap in my nose. She tried to get it out but did not succeed.I remember being rushed to the hospital. I remember being in the room with a very bright light over me and multiple people trying to get the cap out. With the amount of instruments going in my nose, they wound up lodging it even further. It was stuck in the bridge of my nose. There was talk that they might have to surgically remove it.I remember being held down by at least 4 people, maybe more. They took a pair of surgical tweezers and jammed them as high as possible and ripped the plug out. This left my nose damaged for years. I suffered horrible nosebleeds, some lasting 45 minutes to an hour. I have an extremely sensitive nose when it comes to smell. Sharp smelling things trigger a migraine.I'm 35 now. I don't get the nosebleeds like I used to, but still get them occasionally. When I go to Las Vegas, I get one without fail. My sense of smell is still very sensitive, but overall there are no lasting side effects or pain."

none,"I run a physical therapy office and occasionally I get calls passed from our corporate headquarters. I get one today and the corporate rep says she has a patient on the phone from South Bend to get set up in our clinic, which is 75 miles from where she lives. I was really confused but told her to pass the call through.I get on the line and tell her I here she wants to come to us. She says yes. I said you know we are like 70 miles away from South Bend. She proceeds to say the name of our town. I say yes that is correct but why do you want to come to a clinic that is a 90 minute drive? We dance in circles on the phone and she keeps telling me where she lives in South Bend. I'm like right, I got that, but ma'am, we are 75 miles from you. I'm still really confused why she is trying to come to our clinic. So I do some Googling and I figured it out. One of the clinics we have in South Bend is on the STREET NAME of which is the town I am in. I was like yeah no, this is the city of such and such and you are looking for the clinic on the name of that road in South Bend. That was a 10 minute call of which I'll never get my time back."

There was a name that used to come up regularly as a problem patient. A horrible racist, always complaining about people of color having to work at her home. Someone who just wanted to cause trouble. She would be your friend while you were at her house, but would turn you in for the littlest things. She'd call the agency at 5:32 if her aide didn't arrive at 5:30. She also had a million ""health issues."" Luckily there, I never was her aide. I had to talk to her on the phone a bunch though. There were always issues with staffing with her. She banned a ton of people from her house or the aides would request not to go.A while later, I worked at another agency and her name came up on the schedule there. I immediately recognized it and confirmed when I found out where she lived. I wound up getting scheduled with her as an aide. The first few times I met her, she seemed nice and was overall an easy patient. But whooo boy. Did she love to gossip.She told you everything about everything and wanted to hear about everything you did. She would then use this information to spread your business or spin the info to get you in trouble. She asked one of her aides to open her mail. The aide opened the mail. The patient, who we will call Jane, called the agency and said the aide was opening her mail and invading her privacy. She insisted on giving another aide money to take her children to the water park. The aide declined but Jane basically shoved the money in her hand. Jane then called the agency and said this aide stole it.Jane would tell you every bit of everyone's dirty laundry. I tried to keep conversations minimal and talk about my kid and such. I always kept her house clean, did what I was supposed to, made her nice meals, and overall took good care of her. I was a good aide and I thought overall she liked me. I had to call an ambulance for her once. She told me she loved me as she was being loaded into the ambulance.We had a big issue with Jane because she wouldn't take her medicine correctly. She would take wrong doses and make herself ill. She had an overdose once and had to be hospitalized. Even after the nurses helping her set up meds, she would take whatever she wanted, when she wanted, and would regularly pass out. She would be out of it and tell you the same stuff over and over. After the overdose, she and her family accused everyone at our agency of labeling her a drug addict. The phone calls would never end. Just like at the previous agency. The problems with Jane just kept coming. And at some point, a camera was installed so everything would be recorded or watched live.Her one daughter, we'll call Diane, who lived local, would regularly come by to visit. She seemed to like me as well, but came across as the strong and silent type. She had another daughter, Denise, who lived several states away. Denise happened to come visit for around a week or so. The 4 of us sat around one night. I offered to make Jane dinner but the daughters had already fed her. They also said they would do her medical stuff that night. So we all sat around talking, watching videos on youtube, and genuinely having fun. Or so I thought.Denise started riding my ass while she was in town asking me what exactly my job was. I said I cook and clean for her and help her do her medical stuff and so on. She proceeds to give the other aides hard times as well. The whole family is now treating all the aides and nurses like complete shit. They wind up making unfounded complaints to state. They are one of the reasons we can't pass our state survey. They are doing everything they can to get us in trouble.Denise goes back home. I'm now with Jane one and one again. Her case manager shows up and the 3 of us are sitting around talking about Jane's care and just a general check up. After I leave, Jane tells the case manager a complete and utter lie about me. She tells her that I speak about other patients by name. She also tells her about ""all these guys I go out with"" after I had one lunch date with someone. My boss got a phone call from the case manager and I got suspended for 5 days for a HIPAA violation for speaking about patients. It was absolutely not true. I do not talk about patients by name or other identifiable information. I could have lost everything because of this woman. I didn't have her again as a patient.Several months later, I was on call for the agency. Jane's aide called off and there was no option for anyone else to go except for myself and a very particular time with no adjustments. She gave me a hard time on the phone but she said for me to come since there is no one else. As soon as I show up, she gives me a hard time. I told her you told me to come. I text my boss about it and she tells me just to leave if she wants me to go.I never had her again. She wound up being discharged from us. Too much of a liability and a family of troublemakers.A little of over 2 years later, I was lying in bed. For some reason, her name came to mind. I actually always liked her name, as it sounded like something a movie star could have. I don't know where it came from, but something prompted me to type her name in on Google. Sure enough, she died a couple months ago. Her obituary was written as a glowing review or her. I know obituaries always write about the best of people, but knowing the horrible narcissim and abusive and manipulative nature of this woman, I was disgusted reading it. She was a horrible person and her family is horrible. There was the list of family members' names. When I scrolled back to the previous page, under Jane's obituary, was an article about her granddaughter who had been arrested. For what? Taking a Snapchat of an elderly patient with dementia taking a shower at the nursing home she worked at. Her caption said ""look at this silly bitch."" A family of horrible people."

My Nmom thrusted a bunch of plastic bags in my hand and told me she purchased all the school supplies for my daughter and tells me she spent nearly $30. No one asked her to do it. I was annoyed because I hadn't even looked at the supply list and wasn't even given a chance to buy anything. I was talking to my assistant at work and I've mentioned a few times that my Nparents are both nutjobs. I was telling her about the school supply thing and she said ""Ohhhh but that's so sweet! She did you a favor!""All that did was take me back to all the years of mental abuse when I'd tell people that they were nuts, or when people would say ""wow your mom is sooo nice!"" or doing anything to make me look bad.

I can honestly say it was the best vacation I've ever had. Vacation is now 2 and a half weeks away. I am excited but still have the feeling of dread with the Nparents.My Ndad and I were playing blackjack and I was having a ball. I was winning and the dealer was fun. I wad tipping her. My dad kept yelling at me for tipping her. ""(My name)!"" He yells. ""Why do you keep tipping her?!"" Uh cuz I'm having a good time. I was also a dealer at one point so I know how rough they can be treated. Who cares? It's my money.Nmom has to cause a scene everywhere we go. Always has to be loud and over the top. She also loves to speak for me and make decisions regarding my kid. I called her out on it and she did one of the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen her do. She like, had a blank stare not out me but like off to the side and she started mumbling/moving her lips real slow. Like a child would. I was baffled. It still resonates with me.So, here we are again to deal with these two AND my child but trying to have a stellar vacation. What do?"

I said that I wanted to take her here because that's where I see my therapist at. He said ""Why didn't you tell me you were seeing a therapist? Does your mom know?"" I said why would you need to know that I am? Like what would any business of yours would it be? I said that mom didn't even know until I had been going for like 6 months.

She had put a prime rib roast in the slow cooker this morning. When my daughter and I came in the afternoon, I did some meal prep and cleaned the kitchen up. I had pretty much everything done by the time she walked in the door from work. First, the ""what's wrong"", then she starts bitching because I made biscuits instead of some rolls she got and because I didn't make au jus for the beef. She starts bitching about work and it's the asinine story that she tells about her holiday workday. She's worked the same job at a grocery store for 30+. Yes people are fucking stupid and they don't prep for holidays. We get it. We eat and when my dad is done, she starts with the ""why is he mad?"" He's not mad. He's just sitting there eating. Shut up. She starts cleaning and she takes the crock out of the cooker, full of the fatty beef juices, and asks me to flush it down the toilet. I tell her I just bought the shirt I'm wearing and don't want to splash grease back on it. She makes this noise, like she always does, cuz you know, gotta emphasize that you're a beast by grunting, groaning, hmph-ing, or scoffing. Can't just have a nice dinner. Gotta bitch about nothing."

I said ""You could understand my confusion by sending me a pic of you with a child on an adult website."" All he says is ""Lol my bad.""Tonight on POF, I encountered a similar thing. Dude has 5 or 6 pics up, several of them with his kids. The profile is clearly written to be seeking hook ups. Same thing on Tinder... dude has 3 pics up with his little girl. Then the conversation immediately turns graphic.I'm not a prude but I find this very strange and kind of disturbing. It's like saying ""Hey I'm a family man so we're gonna fuck right?""

He sent me a very nice message on POF and he was a very attractive guy. Since I had updated my profile saying I was out of town and looking for something to do, there was a gigantic influx of messages. I have never seen anything like it before. But his stood out.He picked me up at my hotel. Looked just like his pics, so no surprises there. Very good looking guy. Smelled good. Dressed nice. I said I hope you don't mind but I am sending your license plate number to a friend back home, just in case. No problem, I almost insist on it. We start driving and he tells me what he intends to do with me tonight as far as food/drink/etc.He takes me to a great new brewery in town. We share a bunch of appetizers and beer. The meal was great. The company was fantastic. We were really having a nice time. We leave and during the ride we talk about my trip and I said oh yeah I went for a few swims at the hotel. He says if it isn't forward, can we go to your hotel and swim? Well fuck yeah! We swing by his condo and grab his shorts. Then we stop and get some party favors for the hotel. We go back to the heated pool. I had whipped cream vodka and cream soda. Oh man it was delicious!We swim in this lovely heated pool and are the only ones there. We make out a bit in the pool. Then a little more. Until we can't keep our hands off each other. We get to the evelator. Make out in the elevator. We get to the room. We did not have sex but it was a pleasurable experience for us both. ;) the whole night was everything I hoped it would be.So last night, I start swiping on Tinder. I match with a local who is very attractive. We agree to meet at a bar in town. I arrive there and he doesn't even say hi to me as we are walking in. I was like uh I hope this is him. It was of course. So we go in to have a drink. I immediately am out off because he has horrible breath. I mean just absolutely disgusting. The smell was burned in my nose and I could smell it all night long. We sit to drink and the conversation is very lackluster. I really want to bail but there is no gracious way to get out of it. We have our beer and talk but I am so grossed out by this breath. I was sitting somewhat far from him and all I could smell was hot breath.I start thinking of an escape plan and am discreetly eyeing the exists. I was gonna try to run when I went to the bathroom. I had my purse ready to to. I go to the bathroom and when I come out, he wasn't at the table. I laugh to myself and think did he bail on me? But his coat was there so he didn't leave. I should have just run out but I didn't know if he'd see me running if he came out of the bathroom.I ask the server if there are any more exits because I was to bail on this date. She said whoa how come. I said cuz he has disgusting breath. She laughs and said why didn't you just run out now while he was in the bathroom? I said because I didn't know how long he was in there and he might see me. She says well he just sat back down. I wince and she laughs and reluctantly go back to the table.We cash out and I ask the server if she has any mints. She comes back with two pieces of gum. She says one for you and if you want one to him. I laugj internally and we fo to leave. I said thanks for the evening, I'm going back. He asks to follow me. I said no thank you. He asked why. I said please do not be offended but you have terrible breath and it is a severe turn off. His head slumps. He said yeah my brother told me that yesterday. He says I swear I brush my teeth, must be the meds I'm on. Then he says maybe I'm getting sick. I said well whatever it is, I'm not into it at all. He says well I have gum now! I laugh and say that doesn't really help. I felt bad but he took it like a champ. He messaged me today and said he wished he could've followed me last night since I had a ""perfect body.""Win some.

none,"[Here](https://www.qubicaamf.com/bowling-products/furniture-design-elements) is a link for a visual of the seating of a bowling alley.Unless you have a party of more than (5), you'd probably only rent one lane facing a shared table and another set of chairs facing your seats.**My question is what are callout-able offenses in terms of the people across from you entering your space right in front of your sitting booth and sitting in your booth that is facing theirs?**Context:Went with a friend to a local bowling alley after (5) years. That is to say we never learned bowling etiquette or are familiar with the environment (do's/don'ts, etc.).9 p.m. to close Happy Hour lane pricing.Towards the last 15 minutes of our stay (9:50 p.m.), (5) young men about college age were placed across from us. They weren't drinking any alcohol. They were eating on the majority of our shared table. We had drinks on it. However, they kept sitting in our chairs. I told them we are sitting there once. They moved. But once we left to order food or go to the bathroom - we would find they continued to sit in our space. Lack of respect.They then kept walking through our side in front of our seat/knees. You can imagine after a year of being told to be 6 feet apart during COVID (which is still going on even in some US states) that this is unnerving. That collective trauma isn't healed quickly/easily. No one was masked including us (both fully vaxxed). But in passing through your space in front of our knees they were within 6-12 inches of our bodies. Definitely in our personal space. I don't think that would've been cool pre-COVID. But let me know if I'm wrong to feel my space is invaded.They didn't pass through their side because they had too many guys with long legs that would have to shift those legs for them to get through. So they went through our side & expected strangers to keep moving their knees for them.I thought of:A. Putting my legs up on the shared table near their food. This would prevent their movement on our side along with putting my shoes near their food. It would silently teach them a lesson. But the chance of escalating conflict is high.B. Walking through their side. This would have been an obvious offense & conflict would have definitely escalated.Again - both examples of nonverbal communication.Point A seems casual/impersonal. Point B is more directly aggressive. Both aim to teach a lesson by mirroring their blunt behavior.They didn't have a socially saavy someone to introduce groups and make small talk to reduce tension. Nor did I want to introduce the woman I was with to (5) unknown men or make friends with randos that night. We just wanted to be with ourselves and do our own thing. Like I said - unwinding after a long day.This all was nonverbal communicaiton. And the culture of space is a subpoint of nonverbal communication. It's more subtle. Hard to call out w/o seeming like a douche. Well...unless the person is within inches of you staring you down aggressively. I don't think these guys were looking for a fight. Just unaware young men stomping around without a thought for others.It sucked because my friend was uncomfortable. She did not want to sit in the booth. She stood in-between our booth and the connected booth to our backs on the end facing the approach.I decided to keep my cool & observe.I did not understand bowling culture. I planned to ask later.Tired from a long day and not wanting to deal with the potential of escalating conflict - our food came. Yummy. We ate for the last 15 minutes, each bowled one frame, then left.We asked the bowling alley frontdesk person about it:1. If you have your own personal bowling ball, you can definitely tell them to stop touching it.2. He put them across from our shared table to us since we were the smallest party.3. Food and drink is allowed on that small table.4. We can move lanes at no cost and have our data moved. We didn't know this was an option at all let alone at no cost. Lanes freed up (5) minutes after these men were placed in front of us. However, even if we could switch with (10) minutes left, it would've been a hassell we may not have wanted.5. Regarding the nuances of personal space/boundaries - it was unclear. He didn't have a hard/fast rule around it. It sounded like we just had to deal with people invading our space in a crowded bowling alley.**Any other advice on how I could've dealt with this better especially if the alley is full & don't have the option to move lanes?****If you are the smaller party or are just one person, are you supposed to be okay with a larger group across from you invading your space (again I'd like the pre and post COVID bowling expert perspectives)?**"

For me specifically, I'm curious about tennis walls in West Seattle, Burien, and Georgetown. Unfortunately, I live in West Seattle. (Damn bridge...). Here are all tennis walls on those threads and the ones I know:1.  The west side of Ravenna Eckstein Community Center, 65th and Ravenna Ave (not Ravenna BLVD). 2.  Mt baker tennis center on 28th I think 3.  Solstice park in west Seattle has one 4.  Wallingford courts, Amy Yee court 1, there are two courts off n 50th and 9th one of which has a wall; 5. uw court 7 (singles markings only court) 6.  Redmond High School isn't in Seattle but has one. 7.  There's a nice one just over 520 in Medina and another in Pit Park near (but not right at) the Bellevue I-90 exit. 8. I know Hiwatha Tennis Courts by the West Seattle High School in the Admiral Neighborhood has one. However, you have to take up one half of the middle tennis court to use it. 9. The West Seattle Elementary School has one. You have to sneak past the fence, but it's pretty easy. Anyone else have any recommendations near West Seattle?"

none,"The goal here for me as a straight man is to be seen positively in a space (gay dive bars) where I am ultimately the Other. I am there to have fun and make friends. Style is a form of communication. I want to make sure that aspect of my communication is on point. I am not talking about obvious don't wear a Confederate flag shirt or a MAGA hat. (Perhaps even wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt can seem too conflict heavy even if many of the people in the bar are down with it. It seems like a contextual shirt you can't wear all the time.).I am talking about more subtle clothing items that could trigger discomfort in a LGBTQIA person:1. Wearing anything camouflage. 2. Wearing an open crucifix (I imagine some LGBTQIA people have trauma from the Christian Church. I totally understand & respect that). 3. Any overly blue collar clothes from Cabela's or Carhartt that give off the vibe that I am a straight male that hunts, fishes, & probably shoots guns somewhere (I don't do any of those things).4. Etc. **Context**:In Seattle. Decided to go to a local gay bar (it was a dive bar) with my friend/his fiance. It was a cool vibe. Chatted with some gay guys in the front smoking. Much more welcoming vibe than a straight bar. I swear, as a man I feel like I have to compete so hard there.Anyways, I wore white pants (it was summer) and a rust orange long sleeve shirt. I have transparent Burberry seeing glasses. What got me was wearing a camo hat. It did have the Mariner's logo on the front. But green camo was the first thing you see. I later realized that that bar represented local sports teams. However, I think the camo caused an immediate association with conservatism & hence negativity which I probably do not want. Thoughts?"
none,"Hi all,I have renounced alcohol in 2018. I decided to drink a nonalcoholic beer for the 1st time on July 4, 2021 (yesterday) in Seattle. It was Athletic Upside Dawn. 90 calories for 12 oz & gluten free! I enjoyed it. It was nice to have something else to drink other than orange juice. My renunciation is based on a Shadow Worker helping me realize my body does not want it. It was then reinforced by the 5th Precept of Buddhism when I took a 10-day Vipassana Meditation retreat in 2018. My renunciation's intent is to not get intoxicated so as not to risk immoral action.Nonalcoholic beer does have a slight amount of alcohol. But it won't get you drunk. I am not Muslim or Morman so I don't have those religious restrictions on my renunciation. \------------------------------Anyways, I remember the following in chronological order from going out in Seattle on July 4, 2021:1. Went to a bar before a baseball game. Waitress looked at me funny for a second then brought out the only nonalcoholic beer option (above).2. At the baseball game, a few bartenders looked at me funny at first, then tried to point me in the right direction, but ultimately no vendor had nonalcoholic beer. Sad.3. Went to a gay bar with my buddy and his fiance. I am not gay, but we all enjoy the less aggressive/competitive/more fun environment of a gay bar. The bartender there immediately stopped smiling at me then ignored me when I asked for a nonalcoholic (NA) beer. He didn't even give me options. To my surprise, he pulls out an O'Duls NA beer. However, now that I think about it, he gave me a bottle. He gave my friend a glass for his beer and a glass for her wine. I now wonder if that was subtle disrespect to me or he wanted the bar to know I was drinking NA beer... This is all subtle compared to what I faced in Florida & the South trying to go to bars back in 2018-2019:I would tell a bartender in Florida. He was so shocked he gave me (3) orange juices for free. Then a female bartender took over. She looked at me with suspicion thinking I was taking Molly (MDMA). Maybe it was so far outside of her reality that a tall, dark man on a party holiday would not drink alcohol in the bar. She was intentionally slow in handing me the drink to see if I was fiending for it. She didn't charge me so I guess I can't hate on her that much.Another time I lived with a Jamaican-American nurse. I told her I didn't drink alcohol (it came up in conversation naturally). I remember she literally shoved me out of the sink to do her dishess. Her Jamaican-American friend was like ""Oh hey don't do that."" But she said so quietly.Still not a horrible response. But the worst I've received. However, it sucks to either get a overt/covert negative response or a ""deer in the headlights"" look from another person. Anyone else have experiences ordering NA beers at bars?"
none,"Hi all,Hear me out before you judge.What I notice is that after working out too hard (too much sweat left my body), women seem repulsed by me.It's not racism (I am a mixed race man, but do not sense it in these situations).It's not my smell (many times I am too far away).It's not the visible sight of my sweat (I often wear a black shirt).It's energetic.That is my belief and here's why:I believe my masculine yang energy is drained due to the exertion. Yes, ab work builds up the 3rd chakra (masculine center, personal power in the Indian chakra system). The excessive sweat drains my heart qi (in TCM).I notice when I get deep rest or have meditated for over an hour - women are more attracted to me. It's bizzarre. Nothing changed about my dress, attitude, or posture.This happened a lot to me in the hospital when I had testicular cancer (remission as of April 2021!). Due to the drugs, pain or whatever I did get moments of far superior sleep than at home. Deep sleep. The next morning a new nurse would come in at 7 a.m. Sometimes she was in her 20's or 30's. She would suddenly be giving me all these signs of attraction! Wow! I am here hating myself. I cannot believe anyone could be attracted to bald 162lb me.But of course there were times in the hospital where I was overthinking, wasting away my qi, or generally low energy due to the chemo.I am excessive sweater due to weak lung Qi. My wei qi is weak.An excerpt from [this link](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/exam/internal_tcm_views.html):According to Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, sweat is transformed by **yang qi** evaporating [**body fluids**](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/bodyfluids.html) especially the [**blood**](http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/blood.html), which then it emerges out of the body through the sweat pores. Normal sweating helps regulate and harmonize the internal and external body, and is also responsible for nourishing the skin. Sweating has a dual nature when occurring in disease; the first is to eliminate **pathogens**, a normal reaction of the body's defense system. Secondly, as sweat is transformed from body fluids, excessive sweating depletes body fluids and blood causing further internal disturbance.Out of the 40+ acupunctrists I've seen in over 30 US states, only one man originally from China in Houston, TX hit the nail on the head:**I have a chronic problem overthinking.**He put me to sleep during that session. I swear the light bulbs were literally flickering. Like my mind wanted to overthink so much, but his needles were preventing that regular qi flow.He said mild spice food like Mexican food would help me.This chronic overthinking is due to having an abusive narcissistic mother. Our family was sued by her brother for the first 15 years of my life. She would often threaten me that she would divorce my dad or yell or say she can't take it anymore or that she wish she didn't have us. She was from a wealthy family....Overthinking was a form of self defense. I had to predict her unpredictable outbursts. I never used violence (although maybe I should've. The abuse was cumulatively a lot worse than cancer. But on the bright side, that is how I was able to get over cancer so quickly).While it may have served me then, it harmed me for the rest of my life. I have done over (4) 10-day silent Vipassana meditation retreats to quiet this monkey mind and enter a prolonged state of Wu-Wei (difficult, I know).I have a tendency to overwork. That is due to approval was based on economic achievement via my narcissistic parents (controlling mother-passive father dynamic).Anyways, what do you think?"
none,I sweat like a dog during yoga class. Not even hot yoga. Just a regular Vinyasa flow. Not puddles. But my whole shirt is soaked. I am decent at yoga. I've done it in classes in over 20 U.S. states. Sometimes I notice that I meet a woman before class then after class she just ignores me. Is this due to excessive sweating? Thinking I should always wear a black shirt.....FYI:1. I do not look at other women when I do yoga.2. I am not there with the intention to hit on women. 3. I sit in the front of class when aplicable to make other women more comfortable that I am not staring at their butts. 4. I am a flexible guy that holds tough poses. So people know I am not there to mess around.
none,"This is probably obvious to you all. I two handed swing an 88lb (40kg) KB 100 times a day. 30 is the most I can do consecutively until it feels like my grip will break.I was having lower back soreness with KB swings.

The 15 second video below helped me see that I needed to move my upper body down more on the down swing. That alleviated pressure/soreness from my lower back. It also put the pressure of the swing on my hips more. It slightly made my grip easier (my weak point).Anyways, friendly reminder to those in the know.

There is a mirror behind the rack. I was resting. Looking at a dumbell. A bald white American man next to me says, ""Hey what's your problem?!""I quickly & calmly retort, ""What is your problem?""Why are you staring at me?I am not starting at you. I am staring at the dumbell, resting.Oh sorry. Sorry about that.It's okay brother. You have a good day.I then learned that I can't just stare at one point to rest. People may think I am going to go postal. I need to keep moving my gaze around and never too long at one person. This has never happened in the gyms I have been to in 30 US states and one Canadian province. Even during the Trump administration when I went to all of those states & spent (7) months in the Deep South. I then noticed today that old white men were staring at me. An African-American man as well. People often try to figure out my race. But they end up staring & never asking (which would be rude as hell, but direct) which is annoying. **Question:****Do you all notice more fear towards you, the Other?**"

I haven't even gone through one statement closing on this (it closes on June 23, 2021) CC. I was worried I wouldn't get it.Applied over the phone. The credit department was closed on Sunday.

She told me they doubled my credit.Maybe I should've asked for more?My highest personal CC is a $20k limit AMEX Blue Cash Everyday Rewards.My total personal credit limit is $116k.Due to COVID, businesses under 2 years old were getting a hard time getting a business CC according to my Chase banker. It was a royal pain in the butt to get this business CC. But once your foot is in the door you are good.Pro tip you probably already know - balances on business CC's do not report on your personal CC. As long as you make the monthly minimum payment you are as solid than the person that pays in full monthly from a credit score/bureau perspective."

But I do not want to break the lease. So I offered to show the unit every Saturday/Sunday of July from 1-4 p.m. I won't be in her unit unless someone stops by to be less invasive. This way she does not have to pay me for days vacant if I started looking on August 1, 2021. I know she can break the lease.  I know she has to give a 20+ day advance notice of leaving.   I know she is liable for the days remaining on her lease after she left.  I know it is my legal obligation to find a tenant as fast as I possibly can.**What I do not know is if I can increase the rent while looking for a new tenant or do I have the keep it the same?**I know that in King County (Seattle), a landlord must give at least 60 days notice of a rent increase of 10% or more to a current tenant.**Does this apply in my situation where I have a vacated tenant w/ an active lease while legally obligated to look for a new tenant?**"
none,"As I get older, I realize I want the most energy/health as opposed to losing fat/gaining muscle all the time.I used to heavy lift 3x a week. Avoided cardio like the Devil due to advice from guys like Martin Berkhan from [Leangains.com](https://leangains.com/) and Menno Hensleman from Bayseian BodyBuilding. However, with the shift in perspective, I think I was missing out on a lot of cardio that could've improved my quality of life. Faster recovery. Better blood flow. Low impact if you swim. Potential emotional release/greater flexibility if you do yoga. Etc.The kettlebell has been a powerful discovery in my new focus. 100 swings a day keeps the doctor away. 80lbs, 2 KB's, both arms. I guess the medium weight relative to heavy lifting and the explosiveness allows me to do them daily without overtaxing my nerves. I find it to be more restorative. Compare this to when I did Kung Fu. 2 hours of horse stance & other movements 3x a week. Then lion dancing on the weekends. It was wild. The next day I would collapse on the toilet seat because I couldn't control the squat all the way down.That certainly builds mental toughness/endurance. But that is not what I am going for on my health journey.Here's my personal plan:1. Swim 5x a week in the morning to kick off my day. Less than an hour. Low impact. Great for the heart/lungs. Blood flow. (M-F)2. Yoga daily if possible.3. 100 KB swings a day.4. 3x a week (MWF) of heavy lifting with accessory lifts in Reverse Pyramid Training (RPT) form as I learned from [Leangains.com](https://leangains.com/) back in 2013 when I started lifting. (I am even doubting this for my goal b/c I know how taxing RPT can be).I think that will give me maxium amount of energy without putting my body in a whole of chronic stress.Of course, this depends on stress levels in other areas of my life & total stress. I may have to dial the above down if I have problems at work or something.**What do you all do to improve your quality of life by getting the most extra energy in your day out of exercise?**"

And that report was to Transunion as you can see). **Other Credit Lines:**  Student Loan: 9 yrs & 8 months old. About $2.4k left  Car Loan: 2 yrs & 2 months. About $5k left. (4) year term. I am going to start leveraging myself with a bit more debt. I do know if you do hold debt on CC's, it's best to keep it on a business credit card (GRANTED you make the minimum monthly payment).**Why?**They do not report to your personal credit score. I got a Chase Business Ink CC last month, but they only gave me a $3k limit that I am making minimum monthly payments on (0% APR until April 2022). But I am preaching to the choir here. You all probably knew that. HOWEVER, I want to start holding debt past statement closing dates on personal credit cards. I have so many 0% APR intro offers for X months. I want to take advantage of it. I know my score will take a hit. That doesn't matter. I don't plan to get an auto loan, mortgage or apply for housing in the next year. Even if I did, any credit score above \*I am not ready to play the balance transfer game. Don't want to overleverage myself. Just want to see how I can handle managing more debt.\***Why do I want to play with keeping debt on my CC's?**A. I have never done it before. 95% of the time I pay my total balances before statement closing date. 5% of the time I pay 1-2 days after statement closing, but well before the due date w/ a min payment stated if I miss paying in full on statement closing.   B. I have taken a hyper conservative approach w/ a flawless on-time payment history. I want to take some more risk. Highest CC reported was on a Discover card app at 826 out of 850.   C. I am confident I know what I am doing.  D. I do not plan to apply for credit or housing in the next year.   E. I want to see how it affects my credit score.   F. I see my C-Score as a tool to be used.   G. Frees up more $ to invest elsewhere. **Here's what I know about what I am about to do:**A. If I make the minimum monthy payment each month on each card, it will be marked as paid on time to each credit bureau. If I do not, it will be marked as missed even if it is a 0% APR offer. Correct?B. Having a balance on each card past statement closing date (even if I make the monthly minimum payments) will hurt my score.C. It will hurt my score more if the balance on X card if over 30% credit utilization on that specific card. Correct?D. It will hurt my score more than C if the TOTAL balances across all cards is over 30% of my total $116,300 personal Credit Limit. E. My C-score will quickly correct in 1-6 weeks in situations C and/or D if I pay off all credit debt in full. Correct?F. Given I am still in the 0% APR intro period & make my minimum monthly payments each month, I will not accrue any interest. Correct?G. This is risky. I know. It will take a lot of control & advanced planning. **What am I missing in my knowledge of this game?**"
none,"Hi all,I noticed this when I got my first $15k+ comission check from a real estate sale. It was a side job to my corporate job. Both nparents and an aunt/uncle who were competitive with my parents individually looked at me with shock, fear and awe. Perhaps they were scared I could make it on my own. The very first reactions I noticed were those faces full of negativity followed by a lackluster response. It shocked me.Another occassion was me learning Spanish while away from the family. My mom has a grandmother from Spain, looks Spanish, but is actually Filipina. She can't speak any Spanish and Tagalog not well (I know a shocker for being born/raised there, but colonial history is complex). She got all jealous. Used other people to test me. Then she tested me on her birthday. She asked me how to order steak in Spanish (an obvious test). I chocked. It is almost like I could feel her squeezing my 5th chakra (throat). I could see the negativity coming out of her eyes. Putting me down. Hell, I had cancer at the time. Just finished my 4th round of IV chemo then. She just couldn't let it go. She reveled in it.On my ndad's note, he gave me a rental. It was still in his name, but I managed it/collected the income. He was trying to convince me to act like a low key slum lord like him and not put in a new gas heating system for my tenant. She is a single woman with two children running her own business. The electric bill was unreasonable. When I stuck course, he scrambled. I have it all in writing - easy to see. He then tried his damnnest to get me to just change the filter on the electric heater instead of keep my word on the gas. I folded, my tenant immediately accepted the gas proposal she was dragging her her feet on (I think she was in on it), and then my dad immediately found someone to get the gas system in. He had everything dialed it. HE just didn't want to FEEL like the bad guy. HE didn't want to just let his son be a better manager than him. I couldn't believe this childishness from my own progenitors. It was a shock every.single.time when I noticed this happening. Does anyone else notice this in their nparents?"
none,"Hi all,Had a Bumble meetup with a white American woman 10 years older than me (I am in my late 20's). We are both fully vaxxed. Although I am Roman Catholic, she was looking for someone more Christian (I do not go to Church regularly). But she thought I was cool so she wanted to be friends. I am at a point in my life where I am cool with that. I needed more female friends anyways. I invited her to lunch near her. A 25 minute drive from my house to make it convenient for her. Asian food. We ate, had a good chat, and enjoyed ourselves. Despite being strongly Christian, she has mad progressive stances on a lot of topics.And then....we get the check.I immediately ask for us to pay seperate w/o consulting her (not half/half b/c I ordered a drink & she did not). She immediately says she is cool with that as if she was forcing a sentence to get a voice in a fast paced conversation w/ two other people. Or maybe to say it was her idea too. But.... on the way out we didn't hug or anything. Sign of the times. I almost think I saw a look of disappointment on her face. Maybe its because I drive a Tesla or something. But most likely it could've had to do with the check.**When you meet a woman for the first time off a dating app & its clear she just wants friendship, but you invite her to lunch, do you pay or split the bill?**I don't pay for any of my friends (mostly guys). \-------------------------My only reference experience to this is when I worked at Microsoft two years out of college. A Mexican national classmate worked there so I reached out. We ate at a higher end restaurant on campus. I told her I did real estate on the side. Maybe she thought I was trying to sell her. I wasn't She talked about how Trump made the immigration situation difficult for her to want to invest. Other convo...bill comes and she is like - nope not budging with her body language. I paid for it confused. Maybe this was Mexican culture? She has a husband. I knew that back in college. Maybe she felt entitled b/c she thought I was trying to sell her. I didn't like it. It felt presumptous of her b/c A. I was not selling her B. I was just trying to connect & C. I never asked her for anything or talked to her again. \------------------------------But I digress. Back to this Bumble meetup: Paying for her would've been too presumptuous & given the tone that low key thinks its a date. Maybe even sexist if she is a strong feminist. A power move for sure. But to some women it can be interpreted as ""You don't think I can pay for myself, huh?!""Maybe I should've offered and said, ""Do you mind if I pay the bill?"" But then again we are just friends. Why pay? But then again I did invite her out...hmmm"
none,"I've travelled quite a bit. Most people react with some suspicion or disbelief to my teetotal lifestyle. The cool few care. And the truly rare Holographic Pokemon card folks actually give me respect.Example:I was at an Indian restaurant in Baltimore, Maryland. A teenage Indian-American server asked me if I wanted alcohol. I said I do not drink alcohol. Thank you. We got into conversation. I find out he is Muslim (I am not). I tell him that it's been tough living an alchol free life. Avoiding alcohol is easy. Avoiding judgement or others' insecurities are not. He said out loud that choosing to renounce alcohol is a truly respectable choice.Yet....people like us do not get any respect especially in bars or clubs. Most normal people either. Our choice often triggers peoples' insecurities in small/large ways. I say this is a global phenomenon broadly speaking. There will always be groups of people (even large ones like Muslims in the Middle East or Mormons in SLC, UT) that abstain from alcohol.

none,"Hi all,I have an 804 credit score on an 850 scale on Credit Karma (Vantage Score).

Alaska Bank of America CC2. Discover CC3. Chase Amazon Prime CC4. Citi Costco CCHere's what I applied for this year:1. Chase Ink Unlimited Business CC - $3,000 limit. Applied in May.2. Chase Freedom Flex CC - $10,500 limit. Applied in May in Chase branch on same day as #1.3. REI Bank of America CC - $13,500 limit. Applied on the last day of May.With my planned spending - I can hit the sign up bonuses for all of the above.My statement close dates haven't been hit for the above (3) meaning they aren't reported on my credit bureau reports (but those damn hard inquiries are!).My Plan:1. Get an AMEX before the above (3) credit lines show on my credit bureaus (the thought process is that seeing that much new credit will make it more difficult for me to get an AMEX).2. Get (1) more sign up bonus CC like the Capital One Quicksilver ($200 sign up bonus) or that Wellsfargo Cash Wise Visa ($150 sign up).   1. Reason #1 - to get the sign up bonuses   2. Reason #2 - to create relationships with new banks to make it easier to get their business credit cards or other CC's .   3. Reason #3 - to diversify my CC's in case I need to end a relationship somewhere. For example, if I leave Chase I have (3) CC's gone severely affecting my total & average age of credit.3. Maybe down the road I get a CC with Barclays, Synchrony Financial, and Navy Federal Credit Union. But the above moves will make me well diversified. I'll probably focus on business CC's next.4. Increase credit lines every (6) months on cards that do not use hard pulls except for AMEX since they are known to triple their credit lines.**Questions:****What AMEX credit card is the best to get?** My focus is sign up bonuses w/ no annual fees.**If you recommend an AMEX w/ an annual fee as my first, why?**I am aware that once you take advantage of an AMEX sign up bonus on one card you can no longer take advantage of it on other AMEX cards (I believe Youtuber Brian Jung is my source on that).Thank you in advance."
none,"Met up with a woman I used to date in college after I got into remission from cancer. I needed a win because dating during my chemo was out of the question. 1st time we tried to meet up she cancelled. She is a nurse and was having unexplainable shakes. She has health problems with work. So I told her to take care of herself first. Let me know if there is anything I can do.2nd time she actually does come over. She is slow to get out of her car. Not sure if she is tired or felt obligated to see me b/c I survived cancer & she was being nice. We hop in my car, get food, I pay, walk on the beach then go back to my place to play Nintendo Switch. She wants to nap and asked me to close the blinds. Okay....sounds suggestive. I start chatting and testing her out with some touch. She then lets it out that she is seeing someone. Dating? No. Just hooked up with some guy.So I stopped escalating then she said she felt bad....What am I a charity case now? I guess I was so thirsty I didn't kick her out. But she has also been a friend during my cancer process & we had phone sex twice before that process. I move from the floor onto my bed. She follows without being invited. Okay.... She wants to watch a movie. We put it on. She then gets a pillow on me. I put my arm around her. Movie is over. I start to kiss her. Then she starts to cry a bit because she has never been with two guys at once....Okay....I should've stopped to preserve my own dignity, but ya boi's thirsty. Y'all may not have a clue what its like to be in the hospital for a total of (3) months during COVID during the winter fighting for your life and losing all your hair. The lonliness of not being able to see visitors during COVID and not getting a vaccine until 15 days before my official remission was tough. We start making out. We get hot/heavy. She does not want my hands to water below the belt so they don't. I actually get off unbeknowst to her & just stop. I guess it looked like I was considering how she felt. I was. But mostly I lost my desire. So we stopped. Walked her out, she kept hugging and kissing me, and texted to see if she made it home well. I remember back in the old days I would follow Pick Up Artist information. Depending on the situation they would tell you to ""plow through."" But to me this just felt pitiful. I felt like a clear option. I know she wants a long term relationship, but also know she is very sexual (when we used to hook up in college and the phone sex last summer).**What would you have done?**A Pick Up Artist answer would've been that she is lying about the other guy. Or that they aren't dating exclusively so its fair game. However, I know her. I did not think she was lying to me. She is looking for something long term. It made me feel like I wasn't good enough for that position in her life. I know....Hard for you to say b/c my illness is something not everyone can relate to. Losing 45lbs of muscle in a year is akin to being a Prisoner of War. You can relate to the isolation of COVID, but not of COVID & the hospital & a debilitating illnesss (at least I hope you've never had any major health issues). However, we all have may have been someone else's option at one point. Maybe you have been the losing one in the competition to another person your prospective lover is hooking up with. It hurt my self esteem. Hell, it happened two weeks ago. I am writing about it now. But I will keep the smile within my heart & continue to be the best man I can be."
none,We all have that person in our lives. Maybe they faced a tragedy like losing a parent & everyone is super sensitive towards them (20 years later...). Or maybe not.

My intestines fell asleep for that long (ileus). Anylways, doctor wanted me to not eat fruits/veggies until 5/14. Insoluable fiber may be too much for me. I started to juice with my Omega Masticating Juicer. Carrots, celery, other fruits. I notice that I am frequently going to the bathroom, but only bits are coming out. Not to be too graphic, but like a little throw up from my bum. My guesses are:1. Maybe my veggies are old?2. Perhaps my body is going through the beginning stages of detox.

none,"Hi all, Curious about what others think about dipping to 90 degrees or all the way down on stationary weighted dips. I dipped with 90+lbs attached to my armpits without problem. Guess I had the shoulder mobility. I also felt the full ROM would help prepare me for strict Muscle Ups. Al Kavadlo seems to dip to his armpits on parallel bar dips [here](https://youtu.be/0tk1H8XwUYY?t=26). However, he probably does not load weight since he is a bodyweight purist. I know on ring dips gymnasts utilize the full ROM. But maybe my weighted dip will improve if I go just to 90 degrees instead of ATG like my weighted squat. On a related note, I have been trying to go ATG on weighted squats for years. Couldn't go past 250lbs with my 6' 2"" frame. Went to just 90 degrees and was (obviously) able to increase to 315lbs on the first go. Less lower back pain too. However, I know folks that would argue ATG on squats is the way to go. Maybe for pistols. But on weighted squats I could never get rid of the butt wink sufficiently. Always lower back soreness eventually on ATG weighted squats. Thoughts?"
none,"I was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer late 2020. I went through a few rounds of IV chemo and am awaiting a final surgery. I then recover and return to the economy. Either in corporate or as a business owner. I know many cultures praise cancer survivors. But given I need checkups/scans every (3) months for a few years, then every (6) months then once a year worries me. I am also worry of being perceived as unhealthy or less than a human for having my testicle removed to survive. Testicular cancer has no known cause or prevention. I am a healthy and fit guy. It was a shock. **My question is - does telling people in the interview process and/or on the job that I survived cancer help or hurt me?**Perception is everything in business. I do not want to be seen as a weak link (even though it takes a lot of strength to survive cancer)."

Got case numbers as usual. That usually doesn't do anything. The thief put his number and addresses on one of my credit reports. I removed that online. I disputed scores with each credit bureau in 2020. Again in 2021. Then I got serious and email paperwork (a notarized document to Transunion specifically) calling these fradulent in 2021. Pending a response on that. The bureaus threw up their hands saying to contact the vendors. The vendors say to contact the bureaus. Forget Verizon because they keep hanging up on me. Syncb (Syncronicity Bank) mailed me back saying they cannot remvove my hard inquiry in 2021. At least they got back to me....everyone else says up to 90 days and in 30 days I will get a letter. Not so. Credit Karma still has me at 799. Other credit cards have me at 800-823 on a 850 scale. However, I tried to increase the credit line on one of my cards.

none,"Hi all,I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Testicular Cancer last November 2020. I just finished my 3rd of (4) rounds of chemo. My mom brought up how she was bashful to answer the question ""**What can we do to help?**"" from my father's extended family. Like many, she and I have a difficult time asking for help.However, old elementary school friends of mine, parents of my baby sister's elementary school friends, my other sister's roommate on the East coast who I never met, some of my other sister's friends, and other family friends are sending gifts without notice (ice cream via mail, dropping off homemade food, dropping off gifts, sending Amazon gifts, etc.).It got me asking myself - what do other folks (who may or may not have had cancer) prefer?Answering that question in bold  Specifically asking for something like food  Thanking themorJust receiving something at your door  Thanking themPersonally, I prefer the latter option. With online delivery you can order someone groceries, UberEat them food, order them an Amazon package, etc. You just need to ask for their address instead of asking what you can do to help. I see the value in asking what you can do to help. However, it also puts the receiver in a place of asking for help when they may or may not have intended to ask for help. There is an issue with feeling awkward for asking for help too.What do you prefer and why?"

Unbekowst to all of us at the time, I had cancer then too. It created a big ""Oh..."" moment with immediate and extended family that were taking shots at me. To the point when I got back to the States my dad had to tell his sisters to lay off me because my suffering gave him extreme pause. What I see now is my Ndad and Nmom not admitting to the abuses in Mexico. Imagine getting your Wi-Fi cut off during COVID (and I could prove it was them), but your parents do not want to admit it and the Internet company does not want to help you because your name is not on the bill.....Anyways, do you find that in the rare times your nparents do try to apologize, it is indirectly (and w/o taking responsibility for abuses in the near or far past) via gifts or other means?Do normal people do that?For example, another man commits adultry with another man's wife. He feels guilty, but cannot face that man so instead helps secretly pay for the kids to go to private school in an indirect attempt to make ammends for his folly. And yet he cannot truly take direct responsibility for his original offense. So he uses all these indirect, unrelated methods to do that."
none,"I recently subleased a place and gave my security deposit via Venmo with a clear note attached to the leaving tenant on the lease as a sign of good faith. His security deposit was with the apartment building. The agreement was that if I left or the lease ended that I would be given that security deposit back.He tried his best to get me on the lease in his stead. Management was checked out. If he did get off the lease, he would have received his deposit and I would have theoretically been given back my security deposit to be paid to the apartment. I checked into the ER and had cancer that caused me to leave. It was short notice, but I told all roommates. The existing roommates quickly found someone knew. Due to my weakness, I could not talk to that original tenant. My father and him worked out a deal where he would write me a promissory note and I would pay two weeks of December rent (left on December 2nd).He never wrote me that note so I never paid the two weeks. However, I did not understand why I had to pay.Anyways, the guy is stonewalling me.My question - would it have been better/cost effective to use escrow instead of Venmo him my security deposit?I am in a different state and do not have the energy to chase this guy down for a grand."

I vividly recall taking the keys from him in our 2nd meeting with his girlfriend. He was wearing brighter colors, smiling, standing up straight, had more energy, etc. I did not think to clear the energy from the bed or room. It was clean. I am at odds with my back pain (tough to walk down stairs, I am witching positions a lot, etc.) coming from him, fear/hidden emotions in the kidneys (Traditional Chinese Medicine), and weightlifting.

none,"Hello, I am questioning the above quote by Franklin Leonard. It is tossed around so casually in progressive circles. I do believe that someone used to privilege (beautiful man or woman, man, white, etc) gets shook when its challenged - especially at first. Yes, it feels like oppression to them. However, my nuanced question - **is that feeling of oppression felt by a privileged group always irrational and imagined as a defensive reaction to questioning/challenging of one's privilege or is the oppression (maybe use the world extra hardship) real sometimes?** Definition of oppression**1a:** unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power the continuing *oppression* of the   underclasses— H. A. Daniels**b:** something that [oppresses](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oppress) especially in being an unjust or excessive exercise of power unfair taxes and other *oppressions* **Disclosure** \- tan white passing Filipino-American man dual-citizenship with lived experiences in both countries. Born in the USA. Voted for Biden before anyone accuses me of being a conservative. Just here to examine a quote that is said like an absolute when absolutes (always, never) rarely exist in this world. Thoughts:1. A previous white American roommate that went to my same university worked as a bartender at a French Café in Seattle. He brought home a co-worker to the house. My other Latino roommate walked with them from the restaurant to the house. I was in my room. I did not come out, but could hear some conversation. According to the roommates, they were not drunk. Just had a shot or two after the shift. The white American roommate sleeps with the woman who leaves early in the morning. She was married. I am guessing he knew that. What happened was that he lost his job after she eventually left. The white progressive Lesbian owners did not do a detailed investigation. They told him ""the white man has had the benefit of the doubt for too long."" True as that may be, it sounded unfair to me. Grey area situation since I did not have the other woman's perspective. Nor can I say there was a no fraternizing rule in this café. He was shook, but found other work. It did not follow him in the restaurant industry. Given he knew about her marriage, I believe this is an immoral act on his part. But not a fireable offense and not rape. In this case, it feels like the fight for equality across groups did cause real unfair oppression for my roommate. 2. Affirmative Action - not making value judgements on it. What I am about to write is an oversimplification of AA. However, in trying to level the playing field for other POC, let's say there are 400,000 opportunities of X nation-wide. There used to be a pool of 90% white and 10% POC that got that 400k opportunities pre-AA. Post AA all those white folks exist, but now 4,000,000 POC are added to the pool. Higher competitive. # of opportunities do not change. This feels like oppression to the white pool of canidates used to high rates of acceptance as per the title quote. However, this is NOT actual oppression. But it is more competition and more work for the old privileged class of white folks. So it is not simply a feeling of oppression. It may not be classed as actual oppression, but it results in more labor on the whites to compete. To me, this example challenges the blanket statement of the quote. 3. The face of privilege is largely white, male and American on a US-centric site like Reddit. However, in China being a Chinese man is the top (especially since they are a rising economic power). In Mexico, being a white Mexican man is at the top. India has its own caste system to determine its privileged groups. French used to be the language of the elites across Europe in the 1700's. That was language privilege. Globally, now it is English for now. In some contexts (bars and clubs) being a woman (especially beautiful) makes them the most privileged. 4. Privilege is contextual, cultural, national, and sometimes global (like white skin - stated directly or implicitly - being preferred/privileged in Asia, the USA, Europe, Australia/New Zealand, etc). I want to note this because the social justice movement is usually imagined as a white man/woman and black man/woman issue in the USA. LGBTQIA add more nuance and intersectionality to that national/global struggle. But is still not at the forefront in my opinion since they are a smaller (but louder) group. Just want to stimulate some discussion on a quote that is thrown around like it is 100% truth 100% of the time. And anything that seems to claim that (along with its moral high ground) makes me suspicious. No doubt it is true. But it stops at real additional hardships that do get added to privileged people in society's quest for equality. And that quest is mostly just, but is not perfect. Those grey or even black spots are what I hope to suss out that checkmate quotes like this ignore."

none,"I know this may seem trivial, but it is important to me.Everyone I have met sitting, serving and practitioners outside of 10-day courses pronounce Vipassana (from Germany, Canada, USA, Israel, Mexico, etc) as:**Vi-pa-sa-na.**However, Goenka pronounces it ""**Vi-pa-sha-na**."" See this clip:([https://youtu.be/w5A5mrlQx\_Q?t=879](https://youtu.be/w5A5mrlQx_Q?t=879)). The deleted user in [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/loojd/how_to_pronounce_vipassana/) clearly writes:Actually, that's not correct. In Sanskrit, it's pronounced vi-pa-shya-naa. If I recall my high-school Sanskrit correctly, the verb 'pashya' is 'to look.' Vi + pashya means to 'look again' (I'll have to check this last part because it's been a long time).

As for the pronunciation, hard to explain to English-speakers because some of the sounds have no equivalents. Let me try all the same:

vi"" as in 'vineyard'pa as the 'pu' in 'pun'shya is a combination of 'sha' rhyming with 'pa' above, glissing into 'ya' again rhyming with 'pa'. It's a combo sound like the 'ñ' in 'señor' except with an 'sh' instead of 'n.'na is like the 'naa' in that Akon song 'Right now, naa naa naa naa naa.' The Pali pronunciation is different only in that the 'shya' is simplified to a 'ssa' sound (again, rhyming with ""pa"" above).The other pronunciations you've been given are how Westerners pronounce it. ""**Thoughts and Questions:**1. Why do people do this especially if they sat a 10 day listening to Goenka pronounce Vipassana his way the whole time?2. Low key I do not like it when people subtley correct me with the first pronunciation above like its the right way to pronounce it..."

none,"Hi all,My story is below. Feel free to skip and just answer the question. My context is an American legally in Mexico teaching himself how to surf with a decent grasp over Spanish. 9th time surfing ever. Graduated from riding the white washing standing to actual waves. Only straight. I am working on cutting across the wave. Proud of myself. Although I am new, I understand localism and its passive aggressive and aggressive responses now.I surf in Western Mexico in the state of Nayarit in Punta de Mita at a beach called La Lancha. One day I was by myself surfing on my longboard. A boat pulled through with three surf instructors and about 10 Mexican national tourists. No one greeted me or awknowledged my presence. In fact, it felt like I was being actively ignored because people would paddle near me, I would look their way to smile, and they would immediately turn their head. There is no lineup. No communication. Two to three people surf a wave. Instructors push them so they can catch the wave. Just a free-for-all over limited resources. **Dynamic #1** \- Being perceived as a dark skinned Mexican, poor, non-paying customer and/or competition.I am super tan. Black mustache. Black hair. Brown eyes. I have fooled Mexicans into thinking I am Mexican many times. Not my intention. Just the way the tan works. I am also young (27). Regardless of your nationality/ethnicity, Mexico treats their elders extremely well even if they do not speak a lick of Spanish. Those being taught were the light to white skinned Mexicans you would find in Guadalajara. In fact, I have talked to many people visiting from Guadalajara before. If you know anything about Mexico or their ridiculous overrepresentation of light to white skinned Mexicans in Mexican media, you know this country has a [racism problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Mexico). Intersecting with that is the rampant classicism that is far more pronounced in Latin America than the USA. Take Colombia [strata system](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/09/bogota-colombia-social-stratification-system). Similar to the Indian caste system, but not as strict. However, it is akin to the objectification of women by pick up artists who rate women's beauty from 1-10 thus limiting the totality of a human's full potential in all areas of their life. I did not have anything to show I was wealthy while out on the surf. Therefore, the assumption is that I am not rich. It is what it is. I have observed this many times on the beach. A light skinned Mexican just ditches her board before leaving the water for the instructor to pick up. You have to walk 20 minutes through ankle high mud to get there. Many times, they make the instructor take their boards. Hard enough to get through there with one board. I cannot imagine two. I notice the white American students carry their own boards through the jungle to the surf. Anyways, I figured best not interact with these folks. I could flex my [English language privilege](https://linguisticpulse.com/2013/06/26/language-privilege-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/) by starting with English. That would be the fastest way to demonstrate I am not a poor dark skinned Mexican. However, that could rigger Mexican nationalism which is strong amongst the middle to upper class types of Mexicans. Especially the light skinned ones. They have a  stronger sense of ""if you're in Mexico you speak Spanish!"" similar to the USA. You may not interact with these people when you come here because it is highly unlikely they will be serving you. These are the types of Mexicans that hate the fact that tourism is still a big part of the Mexican economy. Again, I have talked to Mexican nationals from the state of Jalisco (tagline is Jalisco is Mexico due to Mariachi, Tequila, Birria, Ranchera music, etc coming from that state). The pride is real. And I have observed it is more nationalistic than patriotic. Also, due to my perceived skin color, they may assume I am Mexican-American or Latino-American due to the vast genetic diversity in Latin America. By starting with English, they would think I am [nopal en frente](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nopal%20en%20la%20frente) and resent me. Unlike the USA, Mexicans rarely ask your ethnicity. They ask where you are from, but unlike the USA they are not going to ask where you are really from/originally from/where are your parents from. I say this to show they would make an assumption and run with it rather than digging into my ethnic background. Starting with Spanish would convince them I am a poorer dark skinned Mexican. Yeah, it may win points with those lower on the social status totem pole of Mexico. However, it really depends on the social status and receptivity of the Mexican in question. The context of surfing is tough because you are not there to chat. The culture is to surf. Plus, they have a big group to talk to each other within. Why risk discomfort to meet someone new while trying to catch waves and balance on your board? In the USA, I know a pre-emptive good morning, smile, how are you? etc is disarming. It prevents a buildup of resentment and opens communication. However, due to my perception in this country, sometimes speaking English or Spanish is a no-win scenario depending on the nationality, skin color, and social status of the person I could be talking to. **Decision** \- keep my mouth shut and keep some distance. I am one unarmed man in a country economically depressed due to COVID. I do not want conflict even if I think I can physically best anyone out there. Mexican police and their legal system is a whole different ballgame. I have the money to fight these people, but do I want to contribute to their corrupt system by having to bribe my way through? Yeah I could flex like that. But looking at the long game - it would result in me compromising my morals. Me taking waves from the instructors/students may affect the tipping of these guys. I figured the instructors would get aggressive. Later they did..... **Dynamic #2** \- four ripped white American software developers from South Carolina rolled through shortly after. I saw these guys in the morning. Did not think they would come back. Chatted with them more. Good guys. Very South Carolina. Found out only one of their friends was fluent in Spanish. That guy addressed me in Spanish in the morning passing by and when they came back despite me starting with English. So goes to show I am not perceived as a white American down here by both sides. These guys shred. And unlike me, they had strength in numbers. They got right next to the instructors and students. They did not talk to them either. I could tell the instructors were pissed. One instructors started blowing a whistle at them a few times. Like who the fuck are you dude? But it's not my country and I knew this would happen. Saying he was going too fast and taking too many waves. The South Carolina guy came up to me and was like ""Dude I had wave priority each time being at the peak and this is surfing. It is up to them to get out of the way.""What he did not understand that I understood was this:1. These are the type of Mexican nationals that expect to be fully pampered. They do not want to paddle out of the way of your wave. They do not want to do anything more uncomfortable than they have to. They basically want the waves to come to them. 2. They are ignorant of surf etiquette or ignore it. 3. The instructors need to make the money. Their service depends on how many waves their clients catch. That is a limited resource so of course they feel entitled to it. Their livelihood (tipping, reviews of their surf school, etc.) depends on customer satisfaction.I did not explain point one to him. But points 2 and 3 helped soften this guy out. He started showing more restraint and giving people waves. Even to me. Good guys. There was a bit more harmony in the water. You could still see those light skinned Mexican men showing a lot of resentment for our presence. But I figured they were both too smart and not powerful enough to start something. **Conclusion** \- did not catch any waves after boat full of Mexican nationals came in. The Americans guys did help me out though. I do notice when enough Americans hit the waves the Mexicans get out of the water. Subtle, but I see it. I learned from this that I have to get in there more and be a little more aggressive. I am showing a bit too much grace to the point of not even being seen as a threat at all. However, the aggressive approach of those South Carolina guys definitely triggered an aggressive response from the local instructors. How do you all act when a bunch of new folks roll through to your spot?Bonus points if it is a foreign country you have no ties too or are a tourist in."
none,"Hi all,Fully teetotal here. I stopped drugs and alcohol over 2 years ago. As a young man in his late 20's, I have struggled with the idea of going to a bar or club to meet women. As of now, I just do not go solo. I went teetotal as #MeToo was getting popular. As a young man, I am doing my best to remove sexist ideology I have been raised with and properly navigate a world of quickly changing power dynamics. It has been quite a task to figure out how to have fun in environments you were introduced to being tipsy to drunk in and everyone else is. My hesitations with going to bars and clubs solo teetotal -1. I do not want to take advantage of women even if they only had one alcoholic drink. Maybe I a wrong in framing it like that. Maybe it is okay. Maybe I am limiting myself. Telling someone you do not drink alcohol (for me due to no past addictions or religion - I just stopped which makes it more bizzarre to drinkers) is shocking enough. I guess I could got a mineral water or non-alcoholic beer, hide my teetoalism, avoid, deflect and manage to succeed in those environments. However, I know I am not being fully authentic and wonder about the ethics of going solo just to meet women. 2. Personally, I believe being tetotal is not buying women alcoholic drinks. Maybe if it is your wife and it was part of dinner. But only alcoholic drinks? You do not drink so why enable someone else on a substance you have renounced? At most, I would buy them a non-alcoholic drink, come off as cheap, have to say I do not drink alcohol or buy women alcohol, and create a mess for myself to dig out of. I doubt many women in those environments would be impressed with a teetotaler or want a non-alcoholic drink. 3. Would not want my money to go to an establishent that promotes harmful substances I have renounced unless it was a work event or with a group. I am not at this boycotting stage yet, but I see myself getting there in the distant future. What are your thoughts on this?If I was with a group (work or friends), no problem being in these environments teetotal. I can point to the fact that I am here with friends. People can still lash out passive aggressively at my teetotalism, but they cannot call me a creep for trying to take advantage of women under the influence. P.S. I did have one hookup on New Years three months into being newly teetotal. Met her on the street between bars. Just an over-the-shoulder talk that resulted in her pulling me to the beach, making out, etc. Her friends called her. They asked to talk to me. They just got on my case for ""taking advantage of a drunk women."" She was tipsy, but we got in the cold ocean in Florida. She definitely had time to sober up. Maybe I should not let that deter me, but I never forgot that. I ended up taking her back to her friends, drove them home as a New Year kindness and moved on."
none,"Hi all,I am contemplating a complete cutoff after 19 months of Low Contact. I returned to the family with a new perspective on life uninfluenced by n's in my life that did not want me to see things as they are. It shocked me. I see my entire family dynamic is toxic. Even the good people gossip, backtalk, etc. So I have a question for those that jumped ship for your own sanity:How do you manage the reactions of those at work, life and potential lovers knowing that you are either No Contact with one/both nparents or your entire family?My fears (let me know if they are irrational or can be handled):1. No one to lean on. Just me in this world.2. A future wife would not like that I will have no family behind me at the wedding. 3. Her family may not approve and it would always be a huge red flag in whether or not I myself could raise a family. 4. Those from family oriented cultures like Latin America (and most people in the world tbh) could never understand my decision.5. If a coworker asked me an innocent question about my family, I would either have to deflect or lie (do not want to do). 6. A company or competitive coworker could do something underhanded like call my family to see what is going on. That could damage my reputation at X company. 7. I feel like I would not be a spiritual person if I did such a thing even though it is clear I am being abused.8. There is no turning back after the decision is made. I would rather be poor in line for the soup kitchen than come groveling back. 9. Some spiritual people tell me my soul chose this family and that I will eventually have to live within it. Completely leaving and staying gone man not be what my soul/destiny/whatever wants."
none,"Hi all,TLDR - local Mexican guy hits me while surfing a wave on my 3rd day surfing ever in Sayulita, Nayarit. I did my best to leave his wave. In a Mexican tourist town. No blood drawn. Nothing fatal. But a personal boundary violation nonetheless. I shake it off.  I was at 6 hours of surfing at this point. Exhausted. Sun burnt. I immediately said a lo siento (I am sorry) when we both resurfaced. He goes straight to English which tells me he knows that I speak English. (Days 1 and 2 shows me they thought I was Mexican going straight to Spanish on me. This adds to me thinking he could have been targeting me. I never spoke English within earshot of him. Or the masajera told him. Word travels quickly in the pueblo.). He said he could not get out of the way.His smile and saying he could not get out of the way threw me off. Perhaps he was genuine. He tells me this next wave is good to take. I just hit it. Stopped. Leashes are tied. Missed it. I tell him this is my 3rd time surfing ever. I can see he is trying to direct me to an easier part of the beach. Then he gets a thought - I need lessons. He needs money. And the peso binds us all together once again. I ask from who. From him! Fist bump each other. Names swapped. Situation turned around  - I have a lesson with him next Monday for 600 pesos ($27 USD).Got out of the water after that.**My questions are**\-  is this an accident or could he have gotten out of the way (given he works as an instructor at a surf school) and not hit me?How should I act next time this happens with another surfer?I remember the day 1 local Mexican guy did not hit me on his wave I was trying to escape (below). But yelled at me in Spanish instead when he resurfaced. (A little intimidating for a first time surfer jajaja).Trying to figure out how to act in the water. Respectful is my default, but you also have to clap back when someone is over the line. That is global. I am reading localism is a problem world-wide. Maybe that is what I experienced. Let me know.\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**More background:**3rd time surfing every today.

Probably only 6-7 sufers out at this part of the beach at a time. Small rollers. No tubes. Perfect place to learn.Anyways, I stayed silent on days 1 and 2 on the water.Bought a massage for an hour. Made friends with the lady there 7 days a week. Park in a sketch alley with what looks like homeless guys manning a bathroom that charges $20p. Always greet them with kindness. Vendors on the beach - buying when I can to show some love.Establishing relationships. Spending money is the fastest way to do that in Mexico.So far - no one has taken my little backpack and beach towel. I leave my wallet in the car.Tried to learn on my own with my [8ft Costco Wave Storm Surfboard](https://varialsurfboards.com/best-foam-surfboard/costco-wavestorm-review/). Due to my ambiguous complexion (I am super tan and have a black beard/mustache) I could tell people were eyeing me up and down. The blonde white Americans thinking maybe I did not speak English, but looked more like them. The Mexicans had some trepidation, but were friendlier.I know the Mexicans thought I was Spanish when I was trying to get out of a local Mexican guy's wave. Instead of hitting me he gave up on it. He started to speak Spanish angrily. Now I do speak Spanish decently, but to disarm him I decided to look at him like I did not understand. He was yelling. Get the hell out of the way, etc. No swear words though. Just an angry dude. It worked. But then he switched to English with a heavy accent. That switch took a lot of steam out of him. He realized I was probably a tourist. And Mexicans in tourist dependent towns know that their potentially bad actions can affect the very livelihoods of all that live in the pueblo. Negative PR hurts everyone.This systematic understanding is evidenced in random Mexican surfers pushing you to go to X restaurant or spend money somewhere. I like how the whole town is working to market each other in that way.Anyways, Day 3. I break the silence. I start light chats with surfers.1st, a French guy. I just give a PSA letting him know it is my 3rd time ever. He starts helping me out. Real cool guy. He points out when a local Mexican dude cuts the line coming in. That is not cool. But says he has surfed everywhere around the world. That entitlement is a general local trend. I think I pushed the line with him by asking him to get lunch. Trying to make friends. Although he said both he and his girlfriend got food poisioning, he also said they just got there yesterday. Do not think he had a GF. But I was just being friendly. Before he left we exchanged names. It ended on a good note with me thanking him for his help.2nd guy - guy from the UK who I found out lives here full time. Less intensive of a chat. Let him know it is my 3rd time ever. He is just giving me tips on respect and courtesy since I asked. I noticed him and the Frenchman were super courteous. Dropping out of waves. The local Mexicans seemed a bit more entitled. The UK guy insists everyone is cool here. I still notice the entitlement especially in the Mexican kids who do not take turns. It is what it is. He swims off.3rd woman - two blond American girls are surfing. This time I am wearing a hat which I think they are ridiculing from afar by talking about a careless friend who they ""cannot believe he wears hats while surfing"". Figured a chin strap on these small waves is no problem. It worked out.I talk to one just lamenting at how slow of a day it is. She agrees. Give my PSA that it is my 3rd time sufring ever, make a joke, she seems dismissive so I disengage. Perhaps they thought I was hitting on them like guy number 1 because the 4th guy below says to them in Spanish if I was bothering them. I paddle away after that. A little White Knighty.I did not talk to anyone on Days 1 and 2 (even beautiful blond women paddling super close to my board) because I could not figure out who was dating who. Mexicans are great. But I know the Mexican machisimo well. And I do not understand surf customs of small chats yet either.4th local Mexican man - just give a greeting in Spanish and a smile. I see he drops a wave early as he sees me trying to get a wave after that.Not trying to be that chatty guy on the water.Not trying to be the silent surfer either.Everyone seems to know everyone. Locals and foreigners alike. I need to figure out who is who. How things work while trying to learn. Politics, water, instablity and learning is difficult when you are alone in a foreign country with no allies. No out of reach. But other stressors you do not have to deal with when learning to play basketball for example.**Action in question:**So after all this another local Mexican guy in my TLDR above hits me while I am trying to get out of his wave.Trying to figure out how I should act next time if I am making a best effort to get out of the way and the surfer hits me.Can they really not control hitting me, do they not like me for some reason, or are they selfish and not want to give up the wave?I am a trained fighter. Despite their numbers, I have no fear of the locals in this pueblo due to its tourist designation. However, I know how pueblos work. Violence should always be avoided. Sometimes it helps to let someone know you will go there. But I think the solution for me is to keep smiling at people, small talk in Spanish on the land, and spending money on anything in a radius around my part of the beach (walking vendors, beach restaurants, etc.)."
none,"1. I remember when I sold my first house on the side from my corporate job. Having that commission check in hand struck fear into the eyes of my nparents. Then my aunt/uncle saw it and looked at me with shock. Then as competition. They could be n's, but not as bad as my parents. It took my parents three months to celebrate it with a dinner. Compared to my sisters.2. Leaving home for long-term solo travel was met with ""give me the house keys, garage opener and a threat to write me out of the will.""  I did everything by the book. 3. When I first learned to cook in high school, my nmom always insulted me. Always criticized me. Criticism or ignoring were the punishments in the convoluted Pavlov's Dogs Rewards and Punishment system they used on me since birth. Any efforts I have made to be independent has been met with some form of punishment. My parents both have abandonment issues. One lost a mother at a young age and the other's father divorced his mother. On top of that, they are n's. Perhaps those wounds led them to becomming n's. Or they were wired that way. Who knows. But I am really starting to get tired of all the petty games used to gaslight, manipulate, and put me down. Maybe I should give it all up and walk....Same for you all? What do you notice in your n-family systems?"
none,"Estoy aquí en Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Los empleados de PEMEX generalmente no usan mascarillas. Tengo curiosidad por saber si ocurre lo mismo en otras partes de México."
none,"Hello, Is my anger misplaced? Am I not seeing things correctly from the view of a security guard? Here is my situation:A. Living in a golf course right off a major highway in Mexico.   B. The front gate has a security guard in front of it 24/7.   C. I drive 7 minutes along a bumpy dirt road and there I am in a community of 30 or so homes.     D. Email 1 to security when I walked on the golf course confirmed it is their property. They can harass who they want. Email 2 to security when I walked on the shared road we all used unfortunately confirmed the same - their property despite it being the only shared road we all use to go in/out. E. They have a high turnover on security. New guy every week so I do not bother forming a relationship now. They also have their guards on rotation over a large swath of land owned by a golf course. F. I do speak Spanish well. As you can expect from an old school Mexican security guard head - the guy does not back down, does not apologize and does not want to hear how his team can be trained better. He is professional with what he writes. But he is very clear in stating I am the problem. Here is what bothers me:1. Everyday I come home I have someone asking me if I live here. It is exhausting when you just want to go home. Imagine getting ID'ed before you come home from work everyday. Perhaps this is the price for private security run by a golf course - let me know. 2. I used to walk on the golf course when it was closed due to COVID until last May. Many other residents did as well. It was an unspoken rule to let us walk here. However, I seemed to be the only guy tagged by security. My most aggressive event - One guy followed me two holes, approached me just before my house, I told him I lived there, he did not believe me, and I proved him wrong. Went up, put my key in the front door, and walked in. He looked pissed. He did not apologize. The problem here is that they can justify this harassment because it is their property. Cool. I accept that. So when the course opened, I stopped walking on the golf course.3. Now I run on the only shared road in/out of the golf course. I figured they could not stop me here (see email 2 in point D above). Also, I thought people would be smart enough to see a criminal would not be running down the public road in broad daylight. Wrong. Both residents and security vehicles would slowly follow me for an unjustified period of time on my runs. No one likes being watched. It escalated into Email 2 in Point D when a security guard pulled directly in front of my path to block the whole road. He questioned me, I chose to speak in English first then Spanish to make the interaction go faster (never saw the guy before in my life), etc. He was cool and let me go. However, it pissed me off that I am even in this situation of getting stopped, having to explain myself on the daily, and being watched like I am about to steal something from a store. It makes a guy feel trapped in a property he owns, but is completely surrounded by a larger, private property owner with armed guards that have a high turnover. Do not get me wrong. I am grateful for private security in Mexico. I argue it's necessary. I honestly do not trust Mexican police or their judicial systems here should something go wrong. But I notice a clear desparity on how I am treated by security and how other residents are treated. I do not mean to make anyone uncomfortable here. But I have to mention that the residents are all old and white Americans or Canadians. I am both young a visibly much darker (Filipino-American). I cannot say how a Mexican perceives me. But I can say in the USA and Canada people have verbally mistaken me for Arab, Mexican, Latino, Japanese, etc. I saw this because I visually do not look like I live here based on the demographics of the other residents. I cannot blame it all on security. I have accepted that it is part of their security protocol to question me. Whether they do it to other residents or not, they have the right. Like the USA, the real problem is sometimes unseen - the BBQ Becky's and Permit Patty's (transformed into what we collectively know as the [Karen](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Karen)) calling the security on me. Whether they be golfers or residents. My suggestions to these guards:1. A sticker for vehicles that live on the golf course. A new guard can be trained to see the sticker and immediately click the button to open the gate. 2. If you have to approach someone you think is not a resident, do it in a less aggressive manner. So I ask again - what is your perspective on all this as a security guard? Am I trippin?"
none,"In Western Mexico currently bunkering down. I wanted to travel to Mexico City....but given how Mexico seems to be loosening its restrictions (or people just getting fatigued economically and with COVID) it seems people are not doing the same type of shaming you would see in a Left Coast city like San Francisco. My 60 year old degreed Mexican architect just got COVID. The guy was making fun of me for wearing a mask, social distancing and such last May. Prayers to him and his family. I look at his defiant attitude towards COVID as a sample size of how that older ""old school"" Mexican approaches these COVID laced times. Not saying you all do not care. Just saying in general I view Latin America as more conservative and heavily involved in Facebook (and its indifference towards misinformation campaigns). I do not plan to travel. But I am curious at how you all respond to that white American or Australian or Chinese person rolling through. I bet in tourists areas they are still catered too even during COVID. Do people give tourists the Evil Eye where you live?What do you think of foreign tourists in your city during these times?"
none,ah
none,"At best, I would get people that ignore it in my social circles. No one actively congradulates me or helps me defend my choice if someone is reacting negatively to knowing I do not drink alcohol-smoke-do drugs.   Do any of you have people that actually actively support and maybe even admire your choice especially if they themselves are not on the same path?"
none,"I cannot speak for the rest of Latin America since I have only been to Havanna, Cuba for a week. I did not notice any stares there. Currently living in Mexico. Big cities  in like Tepic, Nayarit or Guadalajara, Jalisco I usually blend in. Although I got pegged at as an extrajero at the Basilica de Zapopan after I bought some street food. Then a guy in a suit finds me in an obscure part of the Plaza de las Americas to ask for money. So I guess big cities where people generally tend to sit and look (plazas next to parroquias) I get the stares too.   However, anything smaller down to pueblos Mexicans seem to have a [habit of staring](https://www.knowswhy.com/why-do-mexicans-stare/#post-8705:~:text=a%20lot%20of%20tourists%20have%20noticed%20that%20Mexicans%20have%20the%20habit%20of%20staring.%20For) plaza or not. Not sure if this is strictly a cultural phenomenon restricted to Mexico, a class indicator, or some mix of both. Any takers?For the rest of Latin America - do you notice this within yourself and/or your compatriotas towards someone that does not fit the look of the area?"
none,"Hi all - As you know, wearing a mask in the USA is [political](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/01/masks-politics-coronavirus-227765) at this point. The ones not wearing one are usually associated with forgetful people, anti-maskers, and/or conservatives unfortunately. It is almost a visible sign of party loyalty at this point. Do the same dynamics/symbolic messaging exist in your country as well?How do they differ? Do other folks in your country view wearing a mask as a sign of weakness? Or a sign of someone who probably did not like X-Latin American authoritarian regime?"
none,"Not sure what kind of people are on this subreddit and the general biases that exist here. However, I am going to shoot from the hip as usual and write about my uncensored thoughts.Finished Narcos: Mexico Seasons 1/2:Pros:1. Excellent cinamatography. Compare this to El Dragon and you can see why (still a decent show though).2. Strong on the historical accuracy. I enjoyed bits about zooming out and talking about the 80's in general. Comparing the largest coccaine busts to date in Season 2 Ep 9.3. Packing some heat and occassional references to gun history like the scene in the elevator with the guns Hitler's guard used.4. Realistic deaths.5. Showed the brutality of the narco subculture.6. Painfully and accurately portrayed the corruption in Mexico from politicians, police, and even the military.7. Did better at showing that these are just people that needed to eat (that completely got fat off the money/power) due to ruthless politicians hoarding all the wealth.8. Shows how much more money narcotraficantes brought in compared to oil in the 80's. That $4 bil vs the $15 bil USD was scary. Mexico's economy was heavily oil dependent at about 40% of the economey in the 80's.9. Diego Luna,  [José María Yazpik](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946962/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t3), [Fernanda Urrejola](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1343708/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t7), [Teresa Ruiz](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1840708/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t8), etc did excellent work.10. Shows that the Americans were not just the white saviors they were shown to be in the original Narcos in Colombia.11. Flows nicely.12. Did better with showing Felix's bad side, but still mostly glorified the dude.13. Less American-Centric than Narcos in terms of interpretation. There was a fair amount of fuck ups on the USA side and criticisms of the CIA, FBI shooting up civilians in the pueblo, etc.14. Accurately portrayed the corruption in Mexico.15. Beautiful country-side shots.16. I enjoyed how they showed what part of the country they were in and the map visuals when they could.17. Brutally attacked the rich of Mexico with Alexandria Gulimant probably being the only redeeming wealth ""fresa"" (although she cared more about endangered animals than people which is common among the white power class in the USA as well. Easier to care about environmental issues than socioeconomic ones especially if that threatens your power). Honestly, she was complicit in all of it too though. Maybe her enviornmental care was just virtue signaling.18. The top-down authoritarian approach present with the PRI's 90 year dominance (for example) is shown to largely be hurting the people. You need to listen to your employees even if they are not your partners.19. It pays to forgive sometimes, but ultimately most solutions are solved with violence in that subculture.20. Shows some tensions between Mexicans/Mexican-Americans with Kiki that could have been fleshed out more. I guess it is fair they would not send a Mexican-American who could not speak Spanish well, but would send a white American who could not speak Spanish well because well, yeah you know.21. Diego did a fantastic job at going from good cop to resentful, unforgiving and eventually defeated (but still cunning) drug kingpin.ConsA. Paints a dismal picture of Mexico. Accurate, but unfair in my opinion when it comes to the general Mexican people.1. I have been here living near Puerto Vallarta, Mexico since March of this year. I have been coming here since the early 2000's. I have witnessed corruption a few times. Some Mexican nationals on an ATV run from Guadalajara to PV were kidnapped (1 killed) in front of the Costco here two months ago. The New Generation Jalisco Cartel posted a few Twitter videos flexing their firepower a few months ago. A drug lord was recently arrested in Guanajuato. El Chapo's son is giving food to hospitals in Sinaloa. El Chapo is saying he is depressed in Colorado's maximum security prison due to COVID restrictions. This is still ongoing.2. Banorte, one of Mexico's 4 largest commercial banks by assets, [was caught in a drug money laundering operation in the late 90's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banorte#Money_laundering_involvement_in_US_Operation_Casablanca:~:text=Money%20laundering%20involvement%20in%20US%20Operation%20Casablanca%5Bedit%5D,to%20defend%20the%20money%20laundering%20charges).3. Mexican politicians are corrupt as hell. Current president AMLO's brother was recently caught accepting a $1 mil USD bribe. Corruption is up in Mexico. Even the US ambassador and former US Ambassador before him warned not to invest here. Seems like nothing has changed.4. Displaying how easy these narcotraficantes can control THE MILITARY in the 80's may be accurate, but paints an extremely bad picture of Mexico from the eyes of an American viewer (and international audience) that has never been here.5. Even though the Military has been patrolling the carretera 200 in response to the Jalisco Cartel - I have no doubt these cats would murder me if I was on the wrong side of Mexican politics. I have no faith in 911 (same as the USA) if I called it down here. Private security is the way to go. Bribes are still very effective; however, I have never had to make one thankfully. I would also not like to contribute to a system of corruption.6. Mexican police - at least I have met some good federales, but no doubt they would do something unethical if their masters told them too. Good news is that at least a few dozens officers got fired in central Jalisco for narco connections.7. Narcos still control large swaths of Mexico. I just believe they are more educated and know not to shoot some mofo in the club over some petty shit. They have adapted and will continue to.8. Does not mention, but clearly displays the anti-intellectualism of Mexico unlike El Dragon which tries to push multiculturality and Mexican technological prowess. From either the foreign or Mexican perspective, it does not support a view that Mexicans can achieve intellectually. Diego Luna is our best bet and some example that guy is...9. No one cashes in their chips. Even the promising Teresa Ruiz pushes it with the Tijuanna cartel until she gets arrested in a warehouse. She came off as so powerful and sophisticated. So much for Mexican pride.10. If I was a tourist ignorant of Mexico, I would never want to come here after watching this show. 1986 is still pretty close especially if the narco problem is still ongoing.11. Shows (intentionality of the directors and editors aside) Mexicans are incapable of long term organization. They eventually break apart.12. Shows that even the common people are active participants or complicit with these narcotraficantes that ""own"" whole cities or towns because they know everyone and have guns.13. Does not delve into the history of why Mexico and Latin America is so corrupt.14. Start at the 300 year Spanish colonalization and extraction of resources.15. Continue to US involvement at all stages of Mexico from 1821 onward.16. See Mexican-American war of 1846-1848 where we took half of Mexico's terrirory by force for $15 mil at the time and forced then Mexican president Santa Anna to sign it. We provoked the war. I do not apologize for it personally. Mexican corruption and disorganization also led to us winning that war. It is just easier to blame the USA than take responsibility for what you can within your own country. And I sure as hell would not give back Texas, California, New Mexico, Arizona, etc. However, I question if Mexico would have the orgaization to develop those terriorties seeing that the power players in Mexico City do not care about the North. The North of Mexico is its own culture more aligned with the USA. Baja California is totally off the national power grid.17. The best way to balance understanding why all this corruption and poverty came to be would be to read [Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of Pillage of a Continent by Eduardo Galeano](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Veins-Latin-America-Centuries/dp/0853459916). Although....that would make the show less sexy and appealing to the American (and even Mexican) viewer.18. I guess we have to settle for Walt's explanation that ""everybody's gotta eat"" and  Guillermo González Calderoni's ""This is just how it works down here - you do not understand!""19. Obviously and accurately showed the technological superiority of the USA. Glad it was led by Kiki who is Mexican-American leading on that, but Walt eventually took a classic American role in season 2.20. Kiki representing the USA in Season 1 was a great counternarrative to the ""white savior complex"" Hollywood is heavily criticized for (#OscarsaresoWhite).21. Falls into many Mexican stereotypes (Bandito lifestyle of Francisco Arellano Felix, the roughness and immaturity of the Sinaloan cowboys, drinking too much alcohol, etc.). All accurate especially for narcotraficantes.22. The dark Mexican/indigenous Mexican bad and lighter skin Mexican good or at least successful is imagery shown all throughout the show. Other than Azul - Season 2 Episode 10 everyone around the table is a light skinned Mexican. And yes, there is a power differential in this society. A pigmentocracy if you will. How Rafa went down was probably accurate, but sad. The dude tried to get clean, but eventually could not control himself. Also, the darker Mexicans are portrayed as the workers, being shooting at others, people getting shot, etc. Again, accurate. Especially for the 1980's. However, it is just too bad that is how things are still down here.23. Language thoughts -24. more que's than mande's than I expected - did not hear mande once.25. all the creative Mexican slang (surprised they did not used naco at all).26. The Whole Marvel Universe of Narcotraficantes feels cool, but ultimately serves to glorify these criminals.27. Weak on showing discrimination against Mexicans/Mexican-Americans by white Americans. Not necessary. Shown once or twice. However, the USA is still dealing with race problems and I have no doubt it was rough for a guy like Kiki in the 80's in the lowest department on the totem pole (DEA). If Trump is still using the ""bad hombre"" line, can you imagine what was said in the 80's in Fresno, CA? USA's moral standing needs to be taken down a notch.28. Did a fair job showing the nasty ways the USA meddled in Latin America. But like the Spanish ultimately won the narrative of conquistadors over the defeated indigenous of mesoamerica - I believe the USA ultimately wins the moral narrative battle over Mexico simply due to all the corruption and violence of these narcotraficantes.29. I do sometimes wonder if there were any good apples in the Mexican upperclass. However, I would not waste my time finding them. Sounds like they were all complicit in the game.I like Diego Luna a lot. Would not change him for some white Argentinian guy playing a Mexican like El Dragon. He is super representative of the majority of Mexicans (and yes, they have a Vida Aspiracional problem with their media here). First saw him in Star Wars. Watched his Pan y Circo in Amazon Prime. The guy is both privileged (born into a degree of wealth), woke, and trying to get other Mexicans to be woke (lot of Mexicans still think [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mem%C3%ADn_Pingu%C3%ADn) is not racist and part of their national culture...).That all said I expect more from the guy in influencing this script to positively portray Mexicans. Perhaps that is boring, but my suggestions are:1. Have someone with the sense to walk off, turn their life around (but still be in touch with them), etc. Diego's 2nd wife is not that deep in the game and she has kids. Francisco tried, but ultimately does not want to be a snitch and gets shot by 30 people despite knowing he has a kid on the way...2. I would have liked to see some forgiveness from someone. **But if that is not true then forget it. I prefer the truth over good PR for Mexico.** It is always eye for an eye. Predictable. Diego at first had the restraint of a warrior in Season 1. That eventually wore off as he got drunk with power.3. Show student protests against this stuff (then you find out nasty stuff like the Tlateloco Massacre of 1968 or the 43 students that went missing in 2014 on a school trip to Mexico City).4. Show someone in the pueblo that refuses to be complicit in narco money. It would have been nice to have that counterbalance of an honest Mexican constantly being observed, but not bothered by these narcos. Doubt those sociopaths would care."
none,"How do you deal with them?I have been more vocal than ever on the white side of my family about racism. I am a Filipino-American. My white (Republican) American father has been extremely tone deaf on my racial experience. After 2016, a lot changed for me. Did some solo-travel in parts of the USA/Mexico/Canada in 2018-2020. And experienced a lot more discrimination than I ever would in Seattle.My father's response to all of this is simply to not listen, but keep lecturing - be yourself!  Of course he does not recognize the multidiscriminatory nature of the USA - I have darker skin, minority by blood/culture/citizenship, and racially ambiguous looking (meaning I do not know how the hell X person will perceive and respond to me based off what they see). It seems the Trump approach of the ""strong do not listen"" (also promoted by Nietzche in his Geneaology of Morals book in the first essay with the master-slave morality) does not seem to be working for America as a whole.Curious as to how you all deal with your clueless (on your experience) white parent (not necessarily Republican)."
none,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Labyrinth\_of\_Solitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Labyrinth_of_Solitude)Hi all - Poet Octavio Paz won a Nobel Prize for The Labyrinth of Solitude. It examines the Mexican mind in the 1960's and before that. It talks about being between Spain and Indigenous culture and the loss of self that occurs when one denies the other. His contrast to American culture is especially enlightening since he gets a lot right about the USA. He seems to have a disdain of the Mexican-American unfortunately.Anyways, is there an equivalent book for the Philippines you can recommend?"
none,"Hi all,   Just bought [this](https://www.samsclub.com/p/bella-vitano-merlot/prod7610107) wine infused cheese at Costco yesterday. It was on sale so I figure why not.   I had some. Okay. I do not see it as getting me back into alcohol which I renounced two years ago. However, I wonder if it does break the strictest definitions of the teetotal lifestyle. I figured this is the best place to ask.  Thoughts?  P.S. I am also influenced by the 5th precept of Buddhism in my personal teetotality -  The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means, and its virtues are [mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness_(Buddhism)) and responsibility,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_precepts#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGwynne2017The_Buddhist_Pancasila-13)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_precepts#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWijayaratna1990166%E2%80%937-14) applied to [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_(virtue)), work, behavior, and with regard to the [nature of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_in_Buddhism).   I do not see this cheese consumption leading to a sluggishness and lack of control. I am not allergic to cheese so it is not unhealthy. Well maybe a slight food sensitivity, but that is it. So on this point, I do not see what is wrong with it."

none,"And as a white man he does not want to attend any at work diversity trainings in response to George Floyd's murder because he is a white man with nothing to say. He will get slaughtered for saying anything. I told him the point is for him to listen and learn. I have never heard anyone say this. Grew up in the 90's. All my friends of all races were on the racial comedy bandwagon. But times have changed. We grew up. Yet it is shocking to see some haven't and that has revealed some scary insights into the people I thought I knew so well. I am Filipino-American. Everytime I say my Tita my white friend changes it to Aunt. Come to think of it, he never asks about my Filipino culture or when I lived in the Philippines for two years. He has been out of the country once to Panama. But that is it. And he mostly found it backwards and abhorrrent (meat market with no refridgeration and lots of flies and such). Natural beauty was cool. People, no. How do I deal with this?I am starting to talk about my experiences with racial discrimination. I am now seeing it is falling on deaf ears. That scares me. It makes me wonder if this guy would have my back if someone called me a FLIP or something racially derogatory at a bar or just laugh with them.Another childhood friend laughed along with an aggressor at a club who called me Juan (referencing I look Mexican when that person obviously knew I was not). He was a stranger to both of us. Yet my ""childhood friend #2"" laughed along with him.I am seriously reconsidering my friendships and wondering who the hell I hung out with this whole time."
none,"Found out my lawn care professional was only mowing one side of my property for two months. I lightly complained about it with the third party that hooks us both up. They chalk it up to a miscommunication despite me making that clear in the past. Lots of ""Thanks for reaching out!"" and the subtley dismissive ""Let us know if you have any questions!"" Are ! marks necessary? We aren't celebrating anything here. All they actually did was tell the lawn care professional. Of course I am bracing myself for a higher bill. Personally, I find this approach condescending, dismissive, and a poor way to handling a rightfully angry customer. Customer service folks - why do use this ""kill'em with fake kindness"" approach?Everyone else - ever get this sort of response? How do you feel and how do you handle it?I was not ready to walk. I decided to wish them well, wait, and see how things change."
none,"This is truly tragic. Do I let my past go? The friends I have known the longest? TLDR - found out my white American friends since childhood do not view me as white because my genetics are 25% Asian and 75% European despite being white passing, but tan. I believe that view upholds the One Drop Rule. It is systematic racism via gatekeeping whiteness. I never wanted to be white. I am against skin whitening lotions. However, my main question is whether I should let my friends go or not?.....I have undergone a two year journey now. Solo travel. I have experienced things my white American father and white passing Filipina mother would want to explain away as not racism (but it very much is). I was always out in the sun so I am tan and it stuck. But without it I am very much white passing. Black hair and brown eyes. Over 6 ft. I did look more Asian before 10 years old, but then I grew stronger features. You could only tell if you look closely at my eyes. I go back to the three white guys I went from K-8 and some from K-12 and still hung out in and after college. Guy #1 - I do not like the new Star Wars (undertone - now that there are women and minorities). This guy was huge on Star Wars all his life. Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver is the only thing he likes about the new SW. He wants to get ripped because of him. It is now clear that if a white guy is not playing the lead it does not matter to him. He gets real quiet when I talk about the racism I have experienced on my journey. Then somehow changes the subject. Guy #2  - laughs when I say I am white. Says racism is a natural human phenomenon. Does not want to go to work diversity training because he is a white guy and can get murdered for saying anything (the point is you have to listen and learn dude). Still watches South Park and Family Guy (pros and cons to both shows, failures on race, but the main point for me here is the guy has not changed). Does not really care when I tell him about the racism I have experienced in my travels. Tries to explain it away. He takes a sneaky paternal approach with me. He texts my dad on the side everytime we talk. I know he does. I have asked him not to. But I do not want to confront him about it again. Either he lies or tells the truth that he is. Either way I terminate the friendship due to lack of loyalty and trust in my ability. I have travelled 48 US states, 3 eastern Canadian provinces and 2 Mexican states during the Trump administration by myself. I am alive. If that is not enough to prove I can make it on my own, then it is just the white savior complex/white paternalism in action. A need for control. Superiority. Power perhaps. Shoots maybe my dad is paying him for information on me. That is another question I am afraid to ask. Subtle, but I can see clearly now. Guy #2's white girlfriend from Florida 5 months ago - you kind of look Mexican (before I went to Mexico). 5 months later post George Floyd's murder - I did not know racism was a thing in 2020. OMG. When I mention racism now I am a tan white guy. She actually changed. I was surprised how much the global protests changed my fellow Americans. I was also surprised at how little it changed Guy #2.Guy #3 - still have not talked to him after 2 years. But when he was a little tipsy he said I was definitely not white, but definitely American. That rocked me. I met a Chinese-American man from Louisiana. Visibly Chiniese unlike me where I am not visibly Filipino. With the tan I am racially ambiguous. He said he never hung out with the white kids because they were super racist. Granted he is 10 years older, grew up in New Orleans, and I grew up in Seattle in the 90's - it makes me feel like a fool.1. Was I the guy that hung out with the racist white kids while all along they subconsciously looked at me as less than simply because I was not fully white?2. Should I have fully aligned with nonwhite friends instead of having my feet in both doors, but 70% towards my white friends growing up?3. Is it racism to gatekeep a white passing minority from being considered white? (I think so. Enforicng the One Drop Rule is the most strict and racist definition of whiteness on Earth. Even the Spanish Conquistadors had more nuance with race. In the USA it is a dangerous binary of us or other.). 4. Are these people really my friends if rough racial experiences of mine simply get brushed aside?5. Can they change and is it worth waiting?6. Is continuing to be friends with them enabling their racism? I am withering in grief. Perhaps embarrased at what I was. And that is good. It is growth. But I feel I have outgrown my friends. Other than Guy #2 getting a masters, none of the other guys changed. Guy #1 talks about travel and physique ambitions which is new. But no action. And he has been going to college for 10 years now. Still not done."
none,"Met these guys from [this](https://www.facebook.com/LaSalsatv/videos/198292208221446/) channel on Facebook on a hike in Western Mexico two days ago. They are called Botas de Nene. They interviewed me because I was on a hike to the Altavista Petroglyphs in the state of Nayarit on a weekday around noon. They were the only guys there at all. It was bizarre to run into a full camera crew in the jungle. Anyways, they had told me their Facebook channel. When I asked if they did YouTube they said no.They film quality videos. 1. I wish I asked then, but why do they only post on Facebook?2. Is there more money to be made over Facebook videos?3. Is there a larger Latin American (in this case specifically Mexican) audience on Facebook instead of YouTube?Just curious if this was the same over Latin America. Trying to figure out what these guys were thinking. In the USA (especially on Reddit and other tech circles) lots of people are dumping Facebook (and trying to dump Whatsapp and Instagram because FB owns them too) over ad manipulation, data mismanagement, privacy concerns, mental health concerns, etc. Seems Latin America has different views."
none,"I was at REI in Fresno, CA going to Sequoia National Park to enjoy nature alone - socially distanced. I hop over to REI to get some of those dried food bags you hydrate with hot water. They were all out. So I ask a gentleman who works there if he knows stores around here that sell those bags. I am not familiar with Fresno. I ask if the Walmart 0.5 miles away had them. I passed it on the way here. He says maybe and another co-worker arrives. They both try to convince me to go to Winco and give me oddly specific directions on how to get to the specific aisle in Winco where to get this product.I ask if Winco is closer than Walmart. After a slightly snobby a morally righteous I do not know I haven't shopped in Walmart for years”. The guy then asks me if I have a smartphone.Ummm yeah dude I do. I shrug this off because I am in a hurry. It rarely happens. But when I do I usually perceive it as condescending and dismissive since I am in my late 20's. Also, when someone asks you for directions after saying they are not from here, defaulting to the smartphone question is both lazy and rude. P.S. I needed up going to Walmart since it was much closer. And I used to hate Walmart, but I've done several weeks worth of car camping at their parking lots around the nation so I've come to be grateful for that at least. I am still critical, but I don't think I'm above shopping there if I need to.Update -Seems like no one likes my opinion. Where are my upvotes people??"
none,"I see this a lot. Discrediting the success of business people because they had a leg up on you in life (i.e. a loan from a wealthy immediate family). **How much of this is jealously and how much of it are actual critiques of a broken system?**Imagine if the USA went super socialist (UBI of $2,400 a month, free healthcare, free higher education, etc.). Some person from a rich family make it big with old money and we would still get folks smacking them down from the fact that they did not start at the bottom. For the record, I do believe in the [moral case against billionaires](https://www.amazon.com/Winners-Take-All-Charade-Changing/dp/0451493249). I am talking about those smaller fish like families with millions of dollars. \*I understand Reddit is full of 20 and 30 year olds without the unparalleled benefits the generations before them received. No doubt that will generate a lot of salt. **The question is what is the salt and what is the substance of this argument against those that do not start at the bottom?**\*\*I am not talking about nepotism. Simply talking about getting a monetary loan from the family. Not taking advantange of potential dynastic connections."
none,"Hi all, Filipino-American here. My mom is Filipina and got burned pretty bad in the PH by her family. She chose a white American husband and migrated to the USA where I was born. We lived in the PH for two years when I was a kid. I went to school in the PH then. But international school. All in English. I could have learned Tagalog in school, but my mother did not want me to learn it. Not overtly. But you could tell there was no excitement in her voice. No reward really. Subtle discouragement. She wanted me to be white. And if I look at all her actions and choices she made that is clear. Maybe it is just her being protective. It does not take a keen eye to see white equals right in the USA and even the world. There is so much privlege to being white or even acting or sounding white. There are a lot of Filipinos in the USA that look a lot more Filipino than me (whatever that means) and do not speak a word of Tagalog. It sucks. It feels like a battle to reclaim my heritage. Reasons why Filipino parents do not teach their kids the language can range from -1. (Intentional) Do not want you to get an accent in English. We just got here (the USA). It´s a pretty racist place. 2. (Unintentional) Do not have time. Have to work all the time. 3. (Intentional, but also unintentional) Got burned by the Philippines in some manner - poverty, violence, some familial disfunctionality, etc. 4. (Intentional) Colonial mentality - as a status symbol - look at how well my kids speak English and they do not even speak Tagalog! (hell even governemnt documents are not in Tagalog in the PH). 5. (Intentional) They were upper middle class or upper class Filipinos and did not learn Tagalog or only use English and speak Tagalog ""only to talk to the maids.""6. Etc. It is complicated. It depends on socioeconomic class, where you were born in the PH, your experiences here, etc. In my case, my Filipina mother does not want me to learn Tagalog. And it is not for a lack of trying. She is straight up gatekeeping the culture. Whenever I learn more about the PH, she perceives it as a threat. Maybe an insecurity of hers. Maybe I triggered a trauma of hers. I have no clue. It is tough when other cultures or even white Americans try to test you by asking if you can speak Tagalog. Sort of like how other African-Americans call white sounding African-Americans the derogatory term Uncle Tom's (even though if you read Uncle Tom´s Cabin, Tom risked his life not tell where two runaway slaves went and sacrificed his own life to protect them). Does anyone else deal with this?"
none,"Born in the US, but dual citizen with the Philippines and lived there for years. Obviously it's a national pastime for Americans to criticize our country/government. It seemsTo be the world's too because we (for now) have a unique position as the leader of the free world. That does not bother me. I'll even egg you on when criticisms the US.However, Latin Americans are not the same. I notice that Latin Americans get super sensitive when you, as an extranjero, criticize aspects of their country/culture. Some conversations just fall flat on their faces. But among themselves they are down to criticize their own government. Why? Example, Mexican Actor Diego Luna of Star Wars fame (US perspective) released an Amazon Prime series called Pan y Circo. Check out the comments and amount of dislikes the trailer got:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dZeFda-IsNsSome criticisms are solid - these are elite majority white/light skinned Mexicans criticizing their country and eating five star meals while many Mexicans are struggling during COVID.The three episodes cover: 1. Environmental issues2. Femicide and Sexism 3. Cartels and the effectiveness of Prohibition. But other comments are the ultra muchísimo conservative equivalent of this guy's a pussy” and this guy's soft” and this guy is a disgrace to Mexico” without providing solid reasons. In those cases, it just seems to be a childish reaction to criticism. I can be wrong which is why I'm asking, but from my POV it just seems that these criticisms attack the collective shadow” of whatever Latin American country the extranjero is criticizing. People don't want to face the darkness in themselves. So they lash against it with denial, willful ignorance, etc. Perhaps you could even go so far as to say it's part of the culture in the US to criticize itself. That freedom of speech is what we proudly defend. But perhaps not the case in every Latin American country. Perhaps if you take them long view from a Mexican perspective you could say the US took half our land in 1850, historically and currently discriminated against our people and have meddled in our countries affairs for too long. They have no place to criticize us.Perhaps for other Latin American countries with a medium view you do not like the US meddling in your country's or neighbor country's affairs historically. Who knows.Those examples only cover US extranjeros criticizing X LA country. Not Europeans, Africans, Asians, Middle Easterners, etc. Let me know your thoughts."
none,"Hi all, I live in Bucerías, Nayarit about 30-40 minutes of a drive to Puerto Vallarta in the state of Jalisco. The last few months have been wild with cartels -1. The New Generation Jalisco Cartel has been posting Twitter videos showing armed force. Apparently they were in Tomátlan which is about 70 miles south of PV. 2. 20 Mexican National Tourists from Guanajuato on an annual ATV ride from Guadalajara to PV get kidnapped (one killed - rest in power) in front of the PV Costco. Big hit since PV is supposed to be safe. 3. A Cartel boss gets taken out in Guanajuato (this could lead to the Jalisco cartel gaining strength).4. 16 million pushed into extreme poverty due to COVID which increases the chances of increasing the violence and joining cartels. The government response I have seen in the last week has been -1. Dozens of military vehicles patrolling the Highway 200. 2. Increased presence of the Tourist police especially in Nuevo Vallarta. 3. Border crossings seem less strict than a few months ago - from Jalisco to Nayarit and back. Not sure if this is a government flex or if AMLO ordered these soldiers to hunt down the cartels. But they have already taken action in Guanajuato. Personally, this is what I wanted to see as an expat to make me feel safer. Anyways, just some thoughts. If you do come down here, COVID is only getting worse."
none,"Why did his wife, Asya, commit suicide?Just because she had a terminal disease and lost her child?I'm here in Mexico and people go through way worse on the daily. Maybe not folks in her economic and genetic class, but definitely the majority (it is estimated 40% of Mexicans are below the poverty line). I feel like the Miguel learned about it then two days later she killed herself. Like c'mon give the guy a chance to figure it out. Mexico suicide rates have been declining. Being a Roman Catholic myself I know how taboo that choice is:https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/MEX/mexico/suicide-rateIt does not seem realistic. This seemed like a lazy way to free up Miguel to go to Mexico and find love.I mean I hear the show is past 70 episodes: way to rush a death. I guess you could say that Asya is beautiful, has always been treated well because of that, then gets something that is terrible that challenges that deeply held belief and perhaps the shock of that and loss of her child causes her to take her life (she is flawed) than the actual disease's effects. But to me it really paints her as a fragile person. She knows her husband is a competent and wealthy guy. She went to one doctor, accepted the diagnosis then OD's on pills. Is this show worth watching?...."
none,"The best I get in the USA is a subtely condescending ""[good for you!](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=good%20for%20you)"" when I tell people I renounced alcohol. The worst I get is agression. A step up from that is further questioning and testing to see if I am telling the truth or if I HAD to get up alcohol due to addiction. No I am not Muslim or belong to a religion that prohibits alcohol (my skin is darker). No I was never an alcoholic.   No I am not allergic to alcohol.   Alcoholism does not run in my family. FYI that does not make me better than anyone else here on this sub. It is just annoying that people have to test me like this. Within the context of the USA, the only people that truly admired our (everyone on this sub) decision were:1. A Guamanian-American police officer in Iowa (born in Guam/Guam genetics, but moved over to Iowa when he was (2)and could never go back, but wants to). He pulled me over, asked to search my car because I had a Monday to Sunday vitamin organizer in the front seat, showed him by plastic transparent box of detox supplies, told him I do not drink or do drugs, offered for him to further search the car, etc. He then realized I was a genuinly good dude. I could see his [pupils dialate](https://www.healthline.com/health/dilated-pupils-love#takeaway). He let me off with a written warning. Odd, but we wished each other well. 2. A Muslim teenager (Indian-American or Arab-American perhaps) working at an Indian restaurant in Delaware. He said it was a truly respectable decision. I understand his religion informed that opinion; however, science should inform the world it is a respectable choice. [There is no safe level of alcohol consumption](https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/no-safe-level-alcohol-scientific-study-concludes). Unfortunatley, we do not listen to science as a whole in the USA.3. A former white American CEO at a Fortune 500. He was transitioning to chairman when we met on a meditation retreat. The difference is that he stopped drinking at 24. He did so because his brother died of alcoholism. He is an active participant in Alcoholics Anonmyous. He complimented me on my decision, but also asked if I had alcoholism in my family. When I said no he did seem to slightly visibly less impressed. Oh well. Here in Mexico. The state of Tequila's origin - Jalisco. Jalisco is often seen as the ""most Mexican state"" since Mariachi, ranchera music, and other clasically Mexican modern elements. So upon hearing I do not drink alcohol it brings up the usual insecurity of someone listening who does. In addition, [it almost seems an affront to Mexican culture not to consume some level of alcohol](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teetotal/comments/hohrib/pros_and_cons_of_making_alcohol_a_pillar_of/). It is also a largely conservative culture. In Canada, I did not tell anyone I did not drink. It was not needed. I was only in three eastern Canadian provinces for 14 days. It never came up in conversation. So I do not know what the reaction there would be. The most aggressive responses I received from saying I did not drink alcohol occured in the Deep South. Florida especially. Given the COVID situation there, I can see why I got those responses. One BnB post shoved me aside from using the sink after I told her I did not drink alcohol. Wild. Anyway, where do you all find people genuinely admire your teetotality?"
none,"Two situations:1. With the police when they either do or do not ask for identification.2. In regular social situations. For example, as a racially ambiguous man, folks always ask me where I am from, where am I really from, where I am originally from, where my parents are from. Americans are obsessed with race. I always get this mini-interrogation which is known as a microaggression (yes, I am an American). With the police:I recall a white ex-military man I BnB'ed with in Golden Valley Arizona. He hated the police. That hate came from his father. He said some pretty old things:1. The fact that you have to put your identity on a passport or driver's license is a way for the government to symbolically limit your being within the confines of that plastic border.2. The police pull up behind your car as a sign of violating your backside. 3. Barely roll the window to hear the police and never respond. 4. The fact that they ask you to identify yourself is a satanic power move. Now it got me thinking about some situations I've had with the police down here in Mexico:1. The federales pulled me over at the border of a Mexican state. He asked for my registration and not license. I offered my passport and he said if you would permit.” Odd. Usually police in the US ask. He said I had the face of a Mexican and he found it odd my car had US plates on the front. I am not Mexican but thanked him for the compliment which threw him off. He eventually thought I was a Navy Seal or Marine there to help fight the cartel. Odd. I kept denying but that only made him think more. It ended with him shaking my hand. Weird. In this situation my overcompliance and kindness threw the police off guard. It worked in my favor - I wanted no conflict.2nd situation was camping in Mexico. The gatekeeper wanted the municipal police to take my plate and my name. I offered my US passport. She declined. Odd. I gave her two names and she was like that's it? I said that is my name, but omitted my other two names. Best not to give too much information when it's not needed.Obviously, my overcompliance helped me in these situations. But I do believer it was a power loss and me being a people pleaser. Thoughts?2. Where are you from?Seattle.Where were you born? SeattleWhere ar shout parents from? Seattle...and Manila - ahh the beautiful sigh of relief from X white American that thought I could've been white.Let's take race out of this if that makes you uncomfortable.This mini-interrogation that can sometimes be genuine curiosity (most often no because why does my race matter we just met and in some cases this is a business situation). However, I have been to all 50 US states and have received that question at least once with someone I just met in every state. I started to just say Seattle. If they persist they lack class and I get more heavy handed with my refusal to answer. It is a microcosm of a cop asking for your ID. Who are you that I have to identity myself to make you comfortable? I haven't gotten snarky with my answers yet. But I also realize in most situations in the USA it is not beneficial to point out I am Filipino-American. The focus is this - by answer this mini-interrogation (given it is an actual microaggression and not genuine curiosity which I still think shouldn't be asked in a first meeting with someone) is this a power loss? Why or why not?"
none,"I notice this weird pattern:Whenever I feel some positive emotion for a period of time (intense or mild) I notice people send a text, email or even try to call. Particularly those closest to me like my narcissistic parents or a childhood friend who keeps trying to pull me back into ""the old me."" I believe in cords of attachment. People that are closer to you have stronger cording. I believe they do not even need to be in the room to feel you. That may just be me. My guess is that they feel your high. They either want to pull you down like crabs in a pot or get you to focus your attention on them to take some of that energy.

none,"I have a highly narcissistic grandfather and parents. I am now questions if some of my aunts from this grandfather are too.Curious about normal uncle/aunt behavior that seems infantilizing.vs.Actual infantilizing from narcissists. Maybe it is all infantilizing.**Context:**I find this take on [infantilization](https://www.ravishly.com/please-stop-infantilizing-me-especially-workplace) to be relevant in my situation:### Infantilization is an issue of power. In a corporate office, for instance, women are infantilized, so they continue to be seen as inferior and therefore less powerful to men professionally.I broke many silent family rules by stopped corporate work to go on a journey of self-discovery and individuation. Of course, my immediate family resisted. Narcs are all about control. However, some members of my extended family did as well.After 19 months, I came back to a family that was largely the same. Resentful of how much ground I covered. I came back during the start of COVID to help take care of my grandfather in Mexico. I knew it would be a viper pit. But....A. I wanted to help out,B. I did not know when my grandfather would die,C. It is nice to have a place to bunker down during all the madness.D. and I also thought providing value would be a nice way to come back into the family.Turns out people in my family did not like me taking pictures of making meals for my grandpa. The mini-PR campaign on the family WhatsApp pissed them off. They did not  want me to look good.**Examples of Infantilization in Question:**Aunt #11. Upon seeing me in person after I texted her asking her not to come to Mexico from the USA (don't infect us please basically), she said, *""Oh my sweet baby boy!""*   1. I think this was an attempt to infantilize me and thus diminish me. Let me know if I am not seeing this correctly.   2. I did not think this was an appropriate way to greet your nephew after not seeing him for 2 years given the context. We left on a bad not after I left on my journey.   3. I promptly ignored her and walked away. She was not wearing a mask or practicing social distancing with grandpa. I had already set the boundary that I would not be talking to her for safety concerns.Aunt #21. On a WhatsApp text she said to me, *""Oh I found this book called Late Bloomers and it sounded like it fit you to a T.""*   1. Again I saw the context as trying to make me sound immature. For me personally, I believe one of the positive insights into my journey is giving up alcohol forever. Not for everyone. And no I am not a Muslim nor was I an alcoholic.   2. Upon providing her with various examples of how I excelled in school, real estate and corporate America, she went silent. She did not respond.Aunt #31. Aunt - *""Yeah so just tell them XX in English they seem to understand.""*   1. Me - ummm yeah I have been to Mexico before. I can tell them in Spanish....You know I speak it pretty well....2. Aunt - *""The sink water is safe to drink.""*   1. Me - Yeah I know I have been here before. \*In fact, been here with you and your family five different times.\*Grandfather1. Me - Hi grandpa where are the mango forests around here?   1. Grandpa - it is pronounced Maang-o.   2. Grandpa - Okayy....I see you are trying to assert dominance over me by correcting me. Do you correct your peers like this? However, you married a Mexican diplomat Spanish teacher, lived in Mexico for 40 years and still cannot conjugate in the present tense in Spanish. I speak way better Spanish than you.2. Grandpa - here are the car keys.   1. Me - ah did you change the the key ring?   2. Grandpa ""This is the car key. SEE. It says ""CAR KEY"" on the label.   3. Me - okay...thanks.3. Me - I think I want to get an MBA grandpa.   1. Grandpa \*instead of being supportive starts to challenge\* - do you have two years of corporate work experience?   2. Me - Yes I have three. You know this...  \*in my head\* man this guy sure is discouraging.In the greater scheme of things, I view this as a tribe (organization, family, nation, whatever) using shame, abandonment and betrayal to keep its members in line. I obviously stepped out of the line and challenged a lot of unspoken beliefs.I realize infantilization is a tool not just used by narcissists. However, I want to confrim two things:A. Are these legitimate examples of infantilization?B. Are people who use infantilization narcissists or can infantilization be used in innocuous ways by family elders?(Obviously I did not provide you enough information to show if my Aunts are narcissits. I do not know. They have terrible listening skills. But I do not think I can say that are. At most narcissistic tendencies. What I can say without a doubt, is that by grandfather is a narcissist."
none,"Hi all,I want to check myself to see if I was not being condescending and/or sexist.**Context -**This event happened when I was in Mexico taking care of my 90+ year old grandfather during COVID. I am still here. Just me, him and his Mexican nurse. This happened (5) weeks ago. We already knew COVID was airborne back in March. Also, it can be spread during the 14-day asomatic period.My grandfather´s life was in my hands. I did not go outside at all. Everything was closed, but I did not attempt to risk myself because I had him there.Anyways, one of my white American Aunts (I point this out because I am Asian-American culturally and nationally - more below) wanted to come down. She wanted to escape the construction noise next to her home in the USA. But....my other aunt who owns the house was going to start a renovation project  below the room she is staying in.....She was aware....And my father has a construciton team that has been working on the house next door for 3 months....**Incident in Question -**So I heard from my parents she was coming down. I decided to text her saying,I repect your decision to do as you please. I do want to ask that you do not come on the grounds that you could catch COVID on the plane. Grandpa is being put at risk because you want to move around. I take my job seriously. I have never asked you do not do anything. I just believe the severity of this global crisis is concerning. If you do decide to come, I will be wearing a mask and keeping my distance. I self-quarantined here for my first 14 days. I expect others to do the same at least for grandpa.**Response -**No text back. She actually comes a day earlier than stated. Not sure if this was a metaphorical middle finger to me or just how it panned out. I did not ask. However, as predicted, she could not stand the construction noise of my father´s team. Then when the construction project below her started she really could not stand it. She quickly found a friend downtown to let her stay in her vacation rental for free. Then she rented a car. Got in a car accident and did not have insurance (a scary thing in Mexico). Got insurance later, but complained it was costing her too much a day. Her sister did not let her use her car which she had down here.Do as she pleases. I just found it sacry for my grandfather that she is going in and out of downtown. She later admitted that three people in her buidling had COVID which is why she is back at my grandfather´s house....**Cultural Thoughts -**I would not even attempt at sending this message with a Tita in the Philippines. Any defiance to an elder is culturally met with sometimes dire consequences. However, she is American with no other national identity."
none,"I realize I am asking for an objective analysis in a biased sub. I will probably repost this question on another sub of people to get a different set of answers. I am a teetotaler myself. I am biased. I recall my early days when I did not drink alcohol at all. My father was a hobbyist filmmaker. He took me to some pretty cool small distilleries around the state of Jalisco. It is amazing how people open up when you have a camera. One small distiller said they recived a 98 score in a contest. One of the big guys (Jose Cuervo, but I think it was Sauza) sent the regulatory agents to shake him down. They found one mistake in his process and shut him down for a few months. Such as life. We visited the [Tequila Regulatory Council](http://www.ianchadwick.com/tequila/controls.htm) in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The only place in the world where they can determine what is tequila and what is not. Tequila's blue weber agave plants are primarily grown in Jalisco and in parts of five other Mexican states. When I started to drink alcohol in college, Tequila was my favorite drink. I often told Mexican and Mexican-American friends they should be more proud. This is their heritage! But I was deaf when they said that was just the stuff X alcoholic family member use to abuse back in the day. It went against my beliefs at the time. They were not as excited about it. I renounced alcohol a few years after college. I now find myself in Mexico seeing it in a new light. Studying the history, the gastronomy, the culture, and of course interacting with it when I can despite COVID in depth. [This article](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/story-about-pulque-vendor-triggers-rally-of-support/) is about a man who makes pulque - a moderately alcoholic drink that predates Tequila by 1,500 years. You ferment maguey sap to make it. What struck me was when he said this - ""**Rodríguez emphasized the importance of maintaining Mexican culture and heritage in an ever-changing world. Young people must plant magueys and rescue the production of pulque so that this tradition and the identity it gives Mexicans is not lost**"".There is a hidden complexity here. Tequila has it roots Spain's 300 year colonial rule over Mexico. Some say it silently promotes a detrimental ""colonial mentality."" Pulque predates that rule into pre-Hispanic roots. In a sense, this man is claiming that the identity and culture of Mexico predates Spain. Not sure if he resents the Spanish or realizes that harms of idolizing your oppressor in subtle ways. Maybe he intended no subtextual meaning. However, he is a proud traditionalist Mexican. From our perspective, he is literally encouraging the youth to make a substance science has found there to be [no safe level of consumption](https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/no-safe-level-alcohol-scientific-study-concludes). I am back in Mexico as stated. Now having renounced alcohol. I have been here when I did not drink, in my drinking phase and now teetotaler for life in a social justice oriented phase of my life. Analyzing the deeper aspects of culture and identity in countries that have a place in my heart. **What are the pros and cons of making an alcoholic beverage like pulque and/or Tequila a part of national identity?**My answers:Pros:1. A national drink everyone can drink at patriotic events. 2. Helps with bonding and can reach across cultures to bond others.3. Connects one with the land where maguey and/or blue weber agave's are grown. 4. Could make someone more environmentally conscious if their plants are threatened. 5. Boosts the national/state/local economy to have a drink that can only be made in your country and in certain states.6. Creates a solid product you can attach your national identity to. As opposed to abstract. But it becomes a symbol in itself too. Cons:1. Health risk to yourself as we all know (preaching to the choir here. I will not go on about the dangers of alcohol mentally, emotionally, financially, physically, etc.). 2. Distributing a toxic substance (not posion, but can be poisonous in excessive amounts). 3. Encourages other sectors of the economy to glorify drinking to increase sales because capitalism. 4. Danger of foreigners narrowly associating Mexicans with an alcoholic beverage. Esp if they do not know much about Mexico. 5. Peer pressure to drink to prove you are Mexican (not sure if this happens. I am sure if you do not drink alcohol as a Mexican people respect that. They are cool folks here. But as with anywhere in the world, I get weird looks when I tell people I do not drink alcohol)."
none,"Hello again,I drove from Bucerías, Nayarit to Compostela/Tepic/Jala/Bucerías, Nayarit. Had my mask on. Social distance. Jala was closed by the federales.What struck me were the toll road booths. They seemed unprofessional and somewhat intimidating. Like a bunch of locals in casual clothes asking you for money. Sometimes the sign says $31 P and they ask for $50 P. I got different answers every time and they never lined up with what the sign said. I greeted them in Spanish and said, ¿Cuánto Cuesta? Next thing I know I'm in a long conversation. No one needs to know where I'm going just let me pay and move through. Many do not give you a ticket (accident insurance for road damage) unless you ask.None of the three pay zones I went through had anyone in the booths (expect in Jala, but people drove through them which may be why these people are not in the booths with chains and cones to stop each car until it pays).Felt a little Mad Max especially since few cars were on the road. I know we are in a pandemic. However, this is also my 1st time going through Mexican toll road booths.Is this normal?"
none,"Hi all,Curious if there is a place in Latin America for someone like me. I am sure there may be a need. But I also would like to be around like-minded people.I was raised in a somewhat wealthy conservative Catholic in a Filipino-American household. Went to Catholic school from grades K-12. Then a Jesuit private college in the US. Dual citizen - US/PH. Had the privledge of living in the PH from ages 8-10 then never went back. I write this because I can relate to Latinos on a lot of notes. We were both colonies of Spain that took up Catholicism en masse. I was born and mostly raised in Seattle. I had my first large solo journey throughout the US and Canada. COVID has me in Western Mexico right now. Solo travel really opened my eyes. Living in Mexico now has made me realized how Left Coast some of my values are. And how much I have changed (not making a value judgement on conservative or progressive values) from initial raising. And how conservative Latin America (again I know you can count Mexico as part of North America) really is.Left Coast Values that I get down with:1. Intellectualism2. Idealism3. Anti-corruption and bribes (I know this will get me in a lot of LA countries).4. Culture of individual fulfillment5. Good government6. Social reform with a commitment to individiual self/exploration and discovery.7. Strong environmentalist.8. Big tech guy having worked for Amazon and Microsoft in the past in corproate.9. Support LGBTQIA rights. Not super loud about it.10. Black Lives Matter Supporter - I am pretty loud about this.11. Spiritual, but not religious, but still identitfies as a Catholic.12. Racial equality.13. I renounced drugs and alcohol (which places me way on the convervative end for most people).What I notice about Mexico that I can get down with (this also overlaps with other parts of LA):1. Excellent and complex food - I enjoy how moles can be mildly spicy. Straight up the prep time in some of these dishes surpass the Japanese and French.2. Most biodiverse nation in Latin America. Beautiful nature.3. Sunny (but damn that humidity though).4. Rich traditions.5. Spanish colonial architecture.6. Loving all the tropical fruits.7. The Mexican identity is strong as a whole. Not sure about the rest of LA.8. Quickly industrializing - better roads at least in Jalisco and I know the majority of Mexico's economy went from oil to machinery and transport. (not tech innovation sadly).9. Economy is set to be the 5th or 7th largest in the world by GDP in 2050.10. Lots of basketball courts in Jalisco and Nayarit. I am told it is because they are easier to maintain that soccer fields. COVID aside, I do not see sports as being too big in Puerto Vallarta. But a tourist city tends to align with the US which is their largest tourist base.11. Deep history with lots of different cultures contributing to what is Mexican culture today (mostly the Spanish then indigenous, but the French had a surprisngly big influence on Mexican baked goods).12. More relaxed pace of life.13. Warm, friendly culture when you do break past barriers (in my case too many).What I do not get down with:1. Lack of diversity of thought - Not many subcultures. I know Mexicans go from white to Afro-Mexican. I know most of the tourist are from the USA (mostly white) or Europe (same). However, within Mexico itself, the diversity of thought seems to be lacking. Maybe I am just not meeting enough progresssive Mexicans. But the majority of LA seems more conservative than the Deep South of the USA. And I spent 7 months in the Deep South during Trump's presidency.2. Smoke and pollution from old gas guzzling cars.3. Internalized Oppression/Racism/Colonial Mentality - I notice a lot of Latinos favor white people. Hell Uruguay is 88% white. Argentina's government has documented efforts of trying to whiten the population. Many Latinos in the USA say they are white. Example - I met a Mexican national from D.F. in L.A., USA who told me he dreamed of being white. He had a white girlfriend (while married to his Mexican wife from the puebla he knocked up in his 20's....) then died his hair blonde. He felt like he was on top of the world. He made a tough decision to let her go because he had a daughter to raise. It was sad hearing that story, but he did not see anything wrong with it. Other examples   1. My white family members get encouraged/rewarded to speak even the smallest amounts of Spanish. I am not fluent, but way better than them. However, I am not white. So the expectations are high for me. I see this play out all the time. It is actually rough to learn Spanish in Latin America if you are not white and perceived to be Latino.   2. My white grandpa paid in a seperate line in the grocery. After I paid and tipped the bagger at Mega I was accused of stealing the swim trunks by a manager there. This was my second month in Mexico so I did not fully understand what she said.   3. My father's construciton workers do not like taking pay from me. They perceive me as nonwhite. It could be age too. But they have no problems with my white aunts, grandfather or father. And only my dad speaks Spanish fluently. I am 2nd best in the family.   4. A manager on my dad's construction project always spoke Spanish to me. I was happy because he never switched out of it. I thought he was being supportive. He later went outside the glass door, wished me well, closed it, then proceeded to talk mad smack about me in Spanish about how I am in Mexico speak perfect Spanish (I never switched to English talking with him). I realized the dude was a old-school Mexican nationalist. I asked the designer who was in the conversation about what I had heard. She admitted in writing what I heard was true. Here is the contrast. My white grandfather who cannot conjugate in the present tense in Spanish was invited to this man's wedding. My father claims that he speaks Spainglish with my grandfather. They have known each other for 30 years. What is the difference? Well my grandfather was in his 60's when they met so he has age. But I low key think perceived skin color was the bigger deal. How else could my grandfather marry a Mexican diplomat who was also a Spanish teacher and never learn Spanish?   5. Large disparities on how I am treated and how my white cousins, aunts and uncles are treated.   6. French being the 2nd most learned language after English in Mexico. Like how many Mexicans are really going to France or Quebec to work or live long term? Seems to be romantisizing the oppressor as more sophisticated to me.   7. I live on a golf course so I am constantly getting Mexican security called on me for walking around when dark by other white residents. One security guard followed me from Par 18 to my house until I opened the door with a key proving I live here. He backed off. We do get robberies. A golf course is an overwhelmingly rich, white space. However, the guards lack discernment. I low key switch to English to let them know I am not some local trying to steal even though I know they do not speak English. This can fit in with Small Mindedness below.   8. A Mexican national near my age born and racist in PV told me I hated white people from bringing up social justice issues. This was after he told me about his racist treatement in Australia/New Zealand.4. Small Mindedness in many places   1. The amount of times I have had folks just stare at me in pueblos (Jala, Compostela, Sayulita, Boca de Tomatlan, etc) amazes me. I waive and smile, but do not get the same. This happens in PV too sometimes.   2. Even at Costco in Puerto Vallarta. They ask me for my passport then mug it like I am not supposed to be able to afford what I am buying.   3. Other than the fact that over 10% of Mexico's population is in the USA, I do not get the sense that you all as a country do not travel much. I think Latin America may be the same. 120 million US citizens have never been out of the country according to a 2020 Superbowl ad. I believe it. The problem is that this leads to ignorance and misconceptions about other races (not all Asians are Chinos).5. Cartel and Crime rates in some places bother me. But I am also not seen as white, drive a shit car, and realize this could potentially save me from being a target.6. PEMEX is a huge environmental transgressor. Recycling is unheard of from what I have seen. Brasil's Bolsonaro is not that much better cutting down half the Amazon while no one is looking. In 2018, Mexico opened up the market for private competition. I am finally seeing other gas stations other than PEMEX. But if that is the big innovation with environmentalism then Mexico (and perhaps the rest of LA let me know) has a long way to go).7. Inefficiencies - not sure if it is like this in the rest of Latin America, but I can fill my own gas. I do not need someone checking. I had some Internet guys come over. They sent three guys. Reminds me of the Philippines. Labor is cheap and people want to work so overstaff. It just seems inefficient after working in corporate America.8. Little talk of Social Justice. AMLO denies women's domestic abuse calls. No one wants to talk about how indigenous Mexicans are treated and underrepresented in the media. Etc. I know this is the same for the majority in LA.9. Tip culture - the tip culture at grocery stores and gas stations make me uncomfortable. Tipping is an offshoot of European aristocracy. Emilio Zapata (Play of Ayala) and (to an extend) Pancho Villa fought against classisism in the decade long Mexican Revolution. Mexico has struggled with classicism for a long time.10. Rigid ideas on what guys should like and what girls should like. I am sure this may change in larger cities like Guadalajara. But that city is also super segregated, racist, and has a lot of cartel killings.  [https://territorio.mx/el-parque-de-las-gatas-racismo-en-guadalajara/](https://territorio.mx/el-parque-de-las-gatas-racismo-en-guadalajara/)11. Lots of downplaying of COVID or straight attacking some nurses in some areas of Mexico.12. I have encountered some anti-American sentiments. Makes sense. Trump is a douche. But then again it could be linguistic discrimination or skin tone discrimination.You know...the fact that I think I could go on means maybe Latin America is not right for me. Shoots let me know if there are some progressive strongholds anywhere. I doubt it. Maybe I should stick to Europe and the Left Coast of the USA."
none,"My existence is kind of odd. I am a minority in the USA by citizenship in genetics. However, I am white passing. My skin got tan at a young age playing out in the sun so much. I decided I liked that skin color and used it as a way to connect with my minority heritage. Big wake up call seeing many do not (and not just white folks a lot of minorities have internalized racism/oppression too and uphold the system with their behavior). It is clear to me that **how you are perceived is how you are received**. The truth no longer matters. Perception rules people especially their initial reactions. Additionally, I was born into high economic privledge as a tall man. The intersectionality of my existence does not line me up completely with a classic minority experience or white experience in the USA. I am here near Puerto Vallarta, MX living in a golf course (historically a white and rich space) community of mostly white Americans and Canadians where my white grandfather has lived for 30+ years. My immediate and extended family has come here almost every December for 2-3 week vacations to visit my grandfather. I came here to take care of him for three months until he could safetly get back to the USA. However, being here by myself (without white family members or friends beside me) has opened me up to a completely different experience:1. I dress casually like everyone else. I was practicing the front splits before a nightly walk in front of a lake on Par 12. A white man passes by and greets me in Spanish even though my first language is English. He obviously perceives me as Mexican. I greet him back in Spanish so as to not make him feel excluded. Little did I know very soon he would make me feel excluded. About 5 minutes I started to walk his way. We were 750 ft apart, but he would nervously look behind him like I was following him. Many people walk the golf course late evening especially since it is closed due to Corona. A security guard from the golf course followed me for 20 minutes then confronted me right before I got to my house. He did not believe I lived in that gated community. I opened my front door and he went off. I thanked him for his service, but the damage was done.2. Yesterday, I was on Par 8 right outside of my house. Started by daily walk. A car driving on the road slows down after the speed bump. I look over and waive. I am holding an iPhone 10X, but this car is over 500ft away. They continue to slow down and mug me. I feel uncomfortable. Five minutes later when I got to the same area where I first encountered the white man about, a security truck comes with lights flashing. That dark skinned Mexican man drives. We lock eyes. He sees I am not Mexican or brown, just tan. Or maybe he recognizes me. Or maybe he seems I am just on a nightly walk with no hat or sunglasses. Just shorts, a shirt and slippers. I have not seen him before. He drives away without stopping me. That has happened before, but this time I clearly connect it to that resident in this 40+ person community telling security on their way out. 3. Many times security questions me heavily if I live here. Even the same person who has seen me multiple times. I have emailed my picture with a hat/sunglasses on and with none of that smiling next to my white grandfather to the head of security. I know we are in troubling times. I imagine there is high turnover in the golf course security. I imagine this guy isn't showing my picture to every new security guard (and some want to play hero like some white police officers in the USA). It just sucks to get interogated everytiime I want to go home. 4. I was finishing checking out of the local grocery store. My grandfather was in his own line. After I paid and tipped the cashier, a female manager stopped me. She asked in Spanish about my swim trunks. I am not 100% fluent so I emptied my American Passport, iPhone 10X, wallet, and showed her my receipt. She brought someone over to translate. He asked where I got my shorts. I told him Costco yesterday in Puerto Vallarta. I actually had a picture of the receipt on my phone. I was going to show him. He said this is stupid and told me not to worry about it. I was shocked. I then joined my grandfather. He was watching from 10ft away. I explained what happened. I looked back. The translator looked shocked I was with my grandpa. He appeared as we were loading the car. He apologized about his colleague saying she was just stupid and ignorant. I asked if it was about my perceived skin color. He looked shocked and said no. I told him this is my grandfather. He looked more shocked. He quietly loaded our groceries with me into the car. I wished him well, but damn did that stick with me. What shocked me the most is that my grandfather called one of my accusers his friend. He did not call them out at all... 5. I was hiking in [Boca de Tomatlán](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/mexico/jalisco/boca-de-tomatlan-to-quimixto-waterfall) three days after the Mexican state of Jalisco lifted its stay-to-home order on May 1, 2020. I was doing my best to follow my AllTrails hiking map. But the unique aspect of this trail is that it takes you through a series of resorts, restaurants and even front yards of homes. I almost went into a closed restaurant. A Mexican man came out yelling at me in Spanish. I was confused. Why is this man yelling at me like I am human trash? I am dressed well - nice hiking backpack, Cole Han Shoes, decent shorts, hat, designer sunglasses, etc. I was obviously off trail. The manager was running on the beach. Upon being able to see I was an American he sheepishly addressed me in English. He told me to go that way for the trail. I thanked him and went on. Of course there are small villages there where foreigners are not allowed to buy property. Those people were nice to me. Not sure why the non-English speaking (aka probably not well travelled) Mexican waiter treated me with such disdain. He perceived me as not white and therefore not having money. Internalized oppression from the Spanish colonial racial caste system from its 300 year rule in México. 6. I could go on. But both within the golf course I live on and in the greater Puerto Vallarta community - I am treated poorly because I strongly believe it is because I am not seen as white. Critical Thinking to Balance my Thoughts -1. Have compassion - we are in COVID season. Everyone is scared. This is not the México you remember. Yet, I realized my experience in México has always been under the aegis of my parents of a white cousin or aunt/uncle next to me. Tough to say.2. 50% of Puerto Vallarta´s economy is tourism. For 150+ years Americans have been coming to México for vacation - mostly white in the hotel zones I will say. The locals have been subconsciously trained to perceive/equate white skin with wealth through decades of tourism. 3. I drive a beat up family car that makes a ton of engine noise and has paint peeling on the hood due to sun overexposure. What I drive does not affect my perception in grocery stores or walks on the golf course, but it does affect my perception in toll roads, coming into the golf course where I live, and etc. I will say in toll roads Mexicans feel bad for me and charge me less than the stated toll. I speak enough Spanish to make a local think I am local. My pronunciation is on point. I do not do that maliciously. Trying to respect the country by learning the language. 4. If I am perceived as American, perhaps there is national discrimination for decades of Latin American discrimination, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo where we took half of México´s territory, but most recently Trump and his divisive rhetoric. Most people see an American and assume we voted for Trump especially if they themselves have not gained the critical thinking perspective of travel. I realize Trump could be drumming up Mexican nationlism and/or patriotism. 5. Mexican colorism (personally I still call it racism because no one takes systematic colorism seriously). They treat darker skinned Mexicans worse than lighter skinned ones. The evidence is growing.    1.  [https://theconversation.com/study-reveals-racial-inequality-in-mexico-disproving-its-race-blind-rhetoric-87661](https://theconversation.com/study-reveals-racial-inequality-in-mexico-disproving-its-race-blind-rhetoric-87661) 6. Etc.On average, I am a pretty racially ambiguous guy depending on who is looking at me. Makes navigating life far more difficult. Action Steps -1. Continue to do my best to learn Spanish as I have been. Better to be perceived as a dark skin Mexican that can speak Spanish than a [Chicano, Mexican-American and/or some sort of Latino (based off who is looking at me) that cannot](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/03/10/588306001/can-you-lose-a-language-you-never-knew). 2. Try to meet all 40+ neighbors despite COVID. 3. Probably come back to México with a better car. I hate to say it, but the hard truth is that it is better to be perceived as well-off and dark skinned than poor and dark skinned. Questions -1. How do I fight back against discrimination on the golf course I walk everynight and the community I am part of when I would rather not talk to a bunch of white folks during airborne COVID season?2. Hang a Black Lives Matters flag and walk around the golf course with it on a pole? (this is not a joke I strongly support the movement. Racial conversations need to happen in bastions of white wealthy too). 3. Make signs around the golf course with my picture on it saying I am a human being too. Talk to me do not call security?Not quite sure how to approach this. My white father and grandfather do not have my back. They have always talked a ""do not rock the boat"" approach here. Yet when one of your own is getting shit on you have to stand up. And it looks like I will have to stand up for myself and non-white people that get discriminated against for their skin tone somehow."
none,"Honestly, it does not seem like there is anything good left especially after spending so much time on Reddit. I did **not** vote for Trump FYI. I consider myself liberal. However, I want to see the glass half full if that is possible with Republicanism. Not just Trump's style. All of it and what is left of it today from years past. The Mitt Romneys, George H.W. Bushes, George W. Bushes, Regans, Eisenhowers, etc. I realize a lot of Southern Democrats came to the Republican party after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Answers may differ on time periods. Mainly curious because my parents are ardent Trump supporters. My father is white. I am a minority and clearly not perceived as white.  I honestly consider leaving my family behind for good sometimes. I have parents that deny when I obviously get racially discriminated. Yet they vote for a system that allows that to keep happening. Hell I am even in a property of theirs on a golf course. The other white neighbors continually call the security on me. Mostly when seen from afar, but once up close. Just yesteday I went on an evening walk. A car slowed down after the speed bump to look at me from 500 ft away. I waived. They kept their windows shut. Suspiciously looking at me while still going slow. Minutes later a security truck came with lights flashing. The guard saw it was me, waived and drove away. Still bothers me. One time a security guard followed me to my house. I had to prove to him I lived there by opening the door. I get there is a high security guard turnover here. However, it is obvious I am not welcome in white wealthy spaces. I never saw this before because I was usually around a white person in these spaces that I knew. Not by myself. I also had several wake-up calls during my travels. My father does not like to rock the boat. He is not calling anyone out even if it is blatant racism. Not even tactfully calling anyone out. One time my mom got racially discriminated against at my baby sisters school. I think she hid it from my dad. Later, I told him. He did nothing. Probably because he realizes keeping the system that benefits him (and our family) is worth a bit of racial discrimination. Who knows. It is complicated. That I am sure of. However, their denial of my racial experience continues to the point where I ask if they really have my back or not?Shoots I could have all the money in the world, but what's the point if I am getting accused of stealing the shorts I walked in with at the grocery store after I paid for my groceries (this happened in front of my white grandfather who I was with at the time)?Yet another front that is tearing at my soul.It is more complicted than a racial note for me. I am a strong environmentalist too, for example. This is one example of a conflict I am having.Is the pursuit of money greater than supporting your own son? Not looking for any pity, sympathy, empathy or compassion. Simply trying to see what is left of the good amongst all the hypocrisy these days in the Republican Party. Please help."
none,"Hi all,Initially came to PV to take care of my 94 year old grandfather. He stayed for 90 days then my aunt decided to take a risk and bring him to the USA. I do not want to overstay my welcome. However, I am here during COVID thinking it is too insane to move to a new city in the USA (my plan before COVID) and look for a job at the same time. Going outside even in Mexico feels like an extreme sport. I have no health insurance in either country (I am a U.S. citizen). I realize that I will pay up to a $300 USD fine and no more according to the below link. Not sure if there are provisions for global pandemic's like this.

none,"Given we are in COVID and assuming you do not have a job, how long can you study a foreign language until you just have to stop for the day?For me it's about 4 hours in 40 minute cycles of work with 15-20 minute hours of rest. I start to get language learning headaches if I overload myself. Trying to skirt language learning burnout is an art.My activities in my current language are:1. 1 hour of Anki - individual words and sentences mixed (vocab and some listening as some decks have audio)2. 1 hour Yabla.com Scribe videos (active listening)3. 1 hour Pimsleur (listening and speech) 4. 1 hour Reading in target language for an hour via Storyling which has audio in my target language along with the text. (Vocab, grammar indirectly, language immersion). 5. Other is learning about the country, gastronomy and food of the country I want to learn the language of. This is usually in my native tongue of English so I don't count this in a day's study. 6. Watch target language shows with target language subtitles but more to relax so I don't count this. More to just get that less useful passive listening in."
none,"Kumusta - Filipino-American here (white American father, Filipina mother). Had a falling out with my mother before I left home to live in a new city. She called me not even Filipino and other hurtful names. I now realize it's because she lost her mom at a young age and me establishing my independence was bringing up old wounds. She was projecting her pain. But her words still hurt. To add insult to injury, I've watched her update my sister's Filipino-Citizenships, but leave mine with my 8 year old picture (I'm nearly 28 now). I lived in the Philippines and went to school there for two years from 8-10 years old. However, due to the classic inheritance struggles between family members, we have never went back. I realize I get citizenship through my mother in the PH. While I was able to take my physical US passport, she refuses to give me my Filipino passport. Am I able to renew my Filipino passport without my passport and without her?Is she able to somehow cancel my citizenship (not through a dirty means of bribing but by legal means) if I am able to get it renewed?"
none,"I was in a resturant in San Diego. I am in my late 20's. Rolled up in a red Tesla and parked in front of the restaurant which I had glass windows. I came out with my friend who is 50 year old German woman and her half black, half white daughter. I myself am Filipino-American. 6 ft 2 in. Darker skin so and the world has made it clear they do not perceive me as white. I mention this becuase that may color my perception in this restaurant. We get a table. A young white waiter around my age serves us. I learn the guy was in the military in the Middle East because the woman I was with (friends, not dating) asked about a dehydrated egg dish. He mentioned he ate that a lot during his service there. Instantly, I realized he is a rougher guy's guy. San Diego has that strong military presence. Anyways, he kept taking subtle shots at me for not saying please and contrasting me with my friends daughter who did. Odd to call that out when you are serving me.At the end, I put up my hand to ask for the check. He passed by and half-jokingly said, ""Woah there no gang signs in here."" Then he did not immediately come over. I just laughed it off. I was confused, but it was obvious my darker skin tone merited that comparison to a gang member. Was my perceived wealth pissing this guy off? Perhaps the juxtaposition of my darker skin and wealth especially when compared to his piss him off? (I may not be African-American, but the Tusla 1922 Massacre clearly show white jealousy when minorities have it better than them). Was this guy just a straight racist?What would you have done in this situation? To me, racism is like a guy punch and claiming a white person is racist triggers a sense of White Fragility that causes a reaction almost greater than that of calling an African-American the ""N-word"" with the hard R. That being said, I probably would not say that was racist. I would say that was offensve, I do not like being compared to a gang member even if intended as a joke. It is in poor taste and I am the customer. You do not know me. This is my first time here. Thoughts?"
none,"Have an n-grandfather I recently took care of for three months during this pandemic. It opened my eyes as to how much of a narcissist this guy really is. It really shook me. I am seriously thinking of not going to his funeral. He has never done anything for me anyways. I think it would help for me to hear other people´s experiences. If you are not from the USA, please say so since I am multicultural as well (Filipino-American - funerals are held in high regard in the PH often 9 days long). It would help to hear other family reactions to your decision not to attend."
none,"I realize there are a ton of criteria on what it would take for you to pay full price for a Switch game. I want to zone in on one criterion - hours of gametime. I recently bought a standard Switch. I quickly realized not all games are made the same. While insanley charming and nostalgic, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening only has [14 hours of main story gameplay, 16 hours main and extra and 21 hours completionist](https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=66255). I paid full price for this. I also paid full price for Super Mario Odyssey. [12.5 hours main story game play.26.5 hours main and extra61.5 hours completionist](https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=42833)That was worth the price to me soley based off the game time (of course I have other criteria as well). For example, recently bought FFX and X-2. Did not know X-2 was online download only so I cannot resell. Also, paid full price for a game that goes for $30 USD on Amazon, but I am in a part of Mexico that does not receive Amazon purchases. Had to buy it in a Walmart-like grocery store. Old games, but still amazing and long game time. However, I also realize all the hard work of making the game was done back in the PS2 days. So tough to say what I would pay. Maybe I should return it and just buy both online. Just looked and it is full price for a digital copy on the [Nintendo Store](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/final-fantasy-xx-2-hd-remaster-switch/). Not on[Amazon where it is $33 USD for a hard copy](https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y). Odd. Curious to hear what you all think."
none,"I read [this blog post](https://www.fluentin3months.com/tagalog/) by Benny Lewis. Judgements on the man and his method aside (Snakeoil salesman, unrealistic expectations, etc.) he makes some great points in the post about how much easier it is to learn Tagalog with local Filipinos than Spanish with local Mexicans -1. English is an official language next to Tagalog in the PH unlike México and many other countries in the world. 2. Most Filipinos speak English unlike most Mexicans.3. \*Tagalog code swithing from Tagalog to English (i.e. Taglish) nation-wide makes it easier for a native English speaker like Benny to speak Tagalog. The transition is more mangegable. 4. Taglish fights against our natural desires for perfectionism making it easier to learn Tagalog. 5. The Philippines acceptance of Taglish prevents the horrid switching right to English when they see you struggle with their language that many of us get in our target language countries. 6. **Under promise, over deliver** \- In Benny´s case in the PH, being a white man was an advantage beceause he was not expected to know the language at all. Same would apply in México. However, if you look like you could be of X country, then you not knowing the language to fluency would come off as rude, uneducated, or ashamed of your own culture. He mentions this in the aforementioned post I linked above. Often times going from whever you are at in a language to the country it is spoken is like trying to bench press 425lbs when you have only been pressing anywhere from 135-375lbs. Sure you may even be an advanced learner (B2 to C1). However, given you have never been to that country there is a whole new culture and climate (environmental, political, social, etc.) to adjust to. My questions apply to any situation where X native English learner mixes their language with the one they are trying to learn with locals. Other questions -A. Why are other languages far less tolerante of this English to X foreign language code-switching for beginner to intermediate language learners in your opinion? (perhaps becuase X country has a lot of natives that learned English as a 2nd language, but in the Philippines you can see that the unqiue place Taglish has nation-wide and English´s prominence amongst most Filipinos does not cause Filipinos to automatically switch to English. You do not get that cultural shut-out so to speak). B. Do you think it would be less pressure for you to learn a foreign language in a country that accepts a unique mix of English and X foreign language like Taglish in the Philippines? Or would it cement improper learning for new learners?Thoughts?P.S. I am Filipino-American with dual citizenships in the USA and the Philippines. I have lived in the PH for 2 years, but the USA most of my life. I realize México was under Spanish colonial rule for 300 years and the PH for 333 years. Unlike México´s Independence in 1821, we were bought by the USA for $20 million (almost $700 milion today) along with Puerto Rico and Guam after the USA won the 1898 Spanish-American War. We fought back, but ended up under American rule for 48 years, then 2-3 years of Japanese rule in WW2, then American rule, then our Independence.In the meantime, the USA had an outsized effect on the PH´s language, culture, entertainment industry (we have the best beauty queens and boxers in the world and for some odd reason basketball is more popular than soccer despite our average national height). The USA may have taken half of México´s territory in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo after the 1846-1848 Mexican-American War. They may have meddled in most Mexican revolutions and helped topple dictators there, but they never truly occupied México like they did with the Philippines. Obviously, Spanish is literally tied to the identity of México as many social engineers throughout México´s history desired. Creating a cohesive identity is difficult in such a vast/complex country. However, the Philippines is more fluid in its identity. This can be seen in the fact that 98% of México´s migrants are in the USA (11.8 million of over 10% of México´s population), but 10 million Filipinos are literally in every country around the world. This causes personal identity issues as it has for me, but this linguistic and cultural fluidity makes us the most adaptable migrants in the world in my opinion. You can find Filipinos everywhere.I could go on. Just wanted to demonstrate reasons why I personally know Taglish is acceptable. But still wonder why many other cultures are far less tolerant of code-switching attempts at early language learners. Perhaps it feels like it is tugging at X native speaker´s national identity heartstrings to butcher their language in such a way to help who is ultimately a foreigner in their land."
none,"Hi all,Maybe this post has been discussed before. Let me know if I suffer from unoriginality here. I finished a 14+ day no calorie water fast two months ago (1 tsp of salt, 1 multivitamin, and occassional hot green tea per day only). Obviously, I noticed my libido shot down tremendously. The value of these water fasts are seeing how the tiniest things are actually stressors you never noticed before. You are literally forced to slow down b/c if you stand up to fast the head rush could cause a quick black out. X0I decided to eat vegetarian with the exception of meat broths for the 40+ days post-fast until today. Here are my observations in regards to NoFap and Food -1. No food, NoFap. 2. Eating before your daily caloric needs to maintain weight is less chance of fapping.3. Eating in a caloric surplus is far more chance to fap due to increased libido. 4. Eating in a caloric surplus (fed) and being nourished (getting all those microvitamins, minerals and intangibles) leads to a higher libido and more chance to fap.5. Resting more recovers energy and thus sexual energy. 6. Higher chronic stress leads to the need to fap. Much like being drunk you have less inhibitions/control. You need a release from the stress. 7. Adding in meat increases libido way more than a vegetarian diet. Not sure what Western science has to say about that in terms of NoFap. But I do know Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) states meat stimulates the Jing and thus sperm. 8. *The quality of a NoFap streak matters more than the actual days.* Someone could fast for 40 days (difficult, but possible) then eat below their caloric maintenance as a way to manipulate the sexual energy. Thus, it is easier to maintain a NoFap streak. You have no idea if some guy is a chronic undereating vegetarian or a meat eater with a nourishing diet continually eating above caloric surplus. 9. For overthinkers, sweet foods regulate the spleen/stomach in TCM. Science has shown that the brain consumes about 20% of your body´s energy. The spleen´s holds the negative emotion of worry. Eating sweet foods (properties of the food is sweet in TCM) is a way to nourish the spleen, calm the mind and stimulate the appetite for overeaters out there. 10. Less chronic stress means more control and longer telomeres. Obvious, but stress management is truly an art with hidden stressors (like that small light in your room or the heavy to light noise of traffic outside at night) still affect you despite your awareness. 11. There has to be some Qigong method to circulate the energy regardless of stress level to lessen the chance of fapping and correctly utilizing surplus sexual energy in other areas of the mind/body. Small/large universe does not do it for me. That wraps up my thoughts. Feel free to add, discuss, dispute, or pick out one sentence I wrote and focus on it. Cheers."
none,"I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CacMP1uWebI) about the black experience in Japan. This woman is a tenacious and highly educated architect in Japan from Jamaica that moved there to teach English to then afford a master's there. Amazing.At the 44 minute mark (exactly) she talks about how you get an uncomfortable headache while learning your newforeign language. That is a sign you level up in understanding. Speaking in your new language even hurts your face as you work to pronounce words.I found this fascinating.I relate to this so hard. However, I have never heard of any polyglots talk about this phenomenon. Especially Benny Lewis who jumps into a completely new culture in an extremely stressful way with his Speak from Day 1 Method with little preparation. I do not think that man has shared any burnout stories or times he had to slow down. I guess that would go against his brand. Maybe he is a natural extrovert and gets energy from others. And/or finds ways to make his experience as enjoyable as possible.1. Has anyone else expereinced these headaches?2. Do you agree they are a sign of a ""language learning level up"" so to speak?3. How do you distinguish these seemingly ""good"" headaches with actual language learning burnout?Edit - 6/28/20202I stand corrected. Benny Lewis has spoken about language learning headaches. Not many other polyglots have or even dedicate a post on it. It is the unglamorous aspect of language learning.[https://www.fluentin3months.com/pain/](https://www.fluentin3months.com/pain/)On a quick Google search I found another Redditor mentioned it here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/43f7s5/should\_language\_learning\_hurt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/43f7s5/should_language_learning_hurt/) That person mentions [saysomething.com](https://saysomething.com) for Spanish learning.

none,"4 questions -1. Do you believe it is right to make fun of a foreigner trying to learn your language in your country?2. Do you believe that does happen and it is helpful to expect some level of teasing, condescencion or nationallistic hostility to prepare yourself for those events?3. Have you had any rough experiences trying to learn a new language in your target country?4. How have you dealt with the perceived put-downs and/or discrimination in your mind and in the actual interaction?Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRzfAdgdx7w) of a young Japanese boy trying to speak Portugese to superstar Christiano Ronaldo. The crowd keeps on laughing at the boy´s attempts until 45 seconds in when Christiano chastizes them. That is class on Christiano´s part.I bet the people that make up that crowd are Bralizians (or perhaps people from other Portugese speaking parts of the world) of all economic backgrounds and education levels laughing at this boy. Perhaps clowning on someone is just a universially Latino cultural aspect.Now I have never been outright laughed at in my target country while learning their language, but I have been put down in less jovial manners -1. Talked behind my back (after my attempts at speaking Spanish a Mexican within earshot said speak Spanish if you are in Mexico damnit).2. Condecensions - subtle and not so.3. Grammar police without the intention to be helpful, but more to dominate/control.4. Those who think I am not intelligent because I do not have a full grasp of their language and use it as an opportunity to put my attempts down to make themselves feel better.5. Impatient people that literally scour the immediate area for an English speaker instead of wanting to listen to me at all.6. People in shock I do not speak in Spanish (I am not white and can pull off some sort of Latin American so it puts me in the category of a some sort of [Latino/American that does not speak Spanish in their eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNxPuQaGmNM). Perhaps they think I know Spanish but I am ashamed to speak it while perceiving me as Latino. More often the case in the USA since English is what I always start with not to alienate anyone).7. If they know English, keep it in English only. I have seen a lot of other polyglots mention this happening so it does not bother me. Now if I paid a language tutor to only speak in Spanish and they spoke only in English....well we would have a problem haha.Of course I have had helpful people. I expect no one to teach me their language. But I do expect basic human respect. Maybe I was foolish to think I would be encouraged, but I am getting the exact opposite more than I would like.And it is not like I am in the mountains. I am in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico - where 50% of its economy is based on tourism mainly from the USA. People here are used to tourists."
none,"Does anyone have any opinions on whether Storyling is worth it for this intermediate Spanish learner?I cannot seem to find any reviews on the site.I bought this beginner [Spanish ebook on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Spanish-Stories-Beginners-Short-ebook/dp/B07XH56GGH).A. I found the content compelling enough which is key.B. I enjoyed the audio that came with it.C. I liked how there were comprehension questions.D. Modern diction.I recently finished it and it took me to a site called [Storyling](https://storyling.com/pricing/).I am looking for a site that can offer comprehensible input +1. It seems they have levels of reading from beginner to advanced.It is either $20 a month or $180 a year with 3 months off.Based off their promotional video I have some thoughts ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLsLnPkPwLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLsLnPkPwLs) ) -1. Audio with stories is great.2. Being able to click on the word and get a definition is cool. However, only one definition. Yabla provides multiple definitions and defines the specific verb form too. 3. Just like Yabla - the flashcard feature does not matter much. Except Yabla links you back to that portion of the video of the foreign word so that is useful. I have Anki so this does not mean much. I have the Anki Auto Adder Extension for Chrome. I am quick with adding cards. I guess the question is how many stories do they have? I do not see how I should pay for a year if I can crush the library in three months. I will email support. I paid $88 (used a different currency for a discount) for a year of Yabla.com Spanish mainly for the active listening of their Scribe. Now that was a real steal.I have tried [Interllinear books](https://interlinearbooks.com/). Excellent start up. However, the Spanish books they have are ancient. It is best to read more modern works to be caught up on up-to-date vernacular. And I do not find that content too compelling. They also have audio with their books, but the price is wowzah ($20-30 a book that is around 120 pages or so).I know I could probably go for a plethora of children´s ebooks and work my way up for free. Or just pick up the Harry Potter Series in Spanish and go from there. However, I do appreciate something more structured with comprehension questions to make my expereince as active as possible.Thoughts?"
none,"Spirituality and spiritual mastery are difficult to define. I went on a long journey and was introduced to Vipassana Meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka. The minimum for that practice is two hours of day of meditation twice a day. I have been consistent, but not at the 2 hours level. However, I notice that not every practitioner has a consistent practice. I have met a variety of spiritual people in my travels -1. The yogi or yogini archetype (could be a practitioner or teacher).2. The people that read a lot of spiritual books ( Qur'an, Bible, Torah, Eckhart Tolle, etc.). 3. The folks that do way too much acid and claim they say God or talk to spirits or generally use drugs in their spiritual practice. I have never seen disciplined use of drugs for spirituality with these types of folks. It seems to be chasing sensations to me. 4. The Judgmental Spiritual Leader archetype - this is someone who is probably in their 50´s and lord their age and amount of experiences over you. Forgetting that you can learn from everyone. They often feel threatened by someone that could know more then them. They get angry when you want to talk about your experiences. This happened to me twice. 5. Spiritual Competitors - I have seen this in Vipassana 10-day retreat meditation halls. One time I started meditating past breaks. After we broke silence on Day 10 one guy literally came up to me and was like ""Hey do you think this is some sort of competition?"" Not at all just doing my best man. Happened with some other folks in varying levels of directness. Maybe it is a guy thing. I noticed some women were giving me sharp eyes too. 6. The Straight Cultural Appropriator - it is cool if you change your name to a spiritual Indian name because you either had a spiritual experience or your Guru gave it to you. However, you have to be all in with that culture - good and bad aspects. You cannot cherry pick what you like and do not. Best way to keep it authentic instead of something like taking [unethical photos while volunteering abroad](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/11/26/565694874/volunteering-abroad-read-this-before-you-post-that-selfie). 7. The Potpourri Person - the person who keeps going from one spiritual practice to another. They sure know a lot, but you question if they have a consistent practice. Spirituality seems more like Pokémon to them - gotta catch´em all. 8. Etc. I understand I may sound judgmental and you may call me out for it. But these are observations. These are types of people I have met in the spiritual community. The ones that have the brightest light are the ones that practice something daily. Could be a simple daily prayer for five minutes. An hour of yoga. Staring at a candle in a dark room for 30 minutes. Staring at the setting or rising sun for some minutes. Chanting. Etc. My personal opinion is that you are not spiritual without a practice. You just choose to latch onto a highly ambiguous and general label because you have not made a firm decision to start a daily practice (again could be daily of one practice or a new practice each day - key word is daily).

none,"Renouncing one´s inheritance is a complex decision especially when you currently have part of that inheritance now. Has anyone renounced their inheritance? Why? How was life right after that and how long did it take for things to get better?I am a guy who was raised in the upper class and middle class depending on which point of my life you find me. Both N-parents gave me a rental house mortgage free mid-way through college. After an epic 19 month journey of low contact (a few months of no contact at a time), I again find myself in a home of theirs in México taking care of my grandfather next door. At first, it was perfect. I did not have the disgrace of moving back home to the USA. It is still there place, but more of a mid-way between my own place and theirs. I could reintroduce myself to my family energy to see if it is right for me. No one can come to México due to the virus (although two Aunts have). What I have discovered is that my family (immediate and extended) is a toxic environment for me - 1. My grandfather is a bigger narcissist than my father. It was a shocker because now I see it. The glorified image I had of him growing up was shattered. That was painful - mentally and emotionally. 2. The family was using my relationship with him to take subtle shots at me as revenge. 3. He never learned Spanish unlike my father. Has has been down here for 40 years. His ex-wife was a Mexican national who taught Spanish to her two sons from another marriage. Therefore, he does not want me to learn. He is finding ways to put me down. 4. My grandfather has betrayed me, lied to me without apologizing and even witnessed an event where someone in a grocery store claimed I was a thief (I did nothing, he introduced that person as his friend and did not introduce me). 5. My N-mom lied to me about not being angry after me leaving on my journey (month 8 my sister confirmed it and in México my grandfather said my parents were devastated when I decided to take a break with no debts, quitting a corporate job, and no girlfriend or children to leave behind. 6. My father was trying hard to get me to manage his construction projects. I asked not to. I was unfamiliar with the project and the language. Plus, COVID. Quedate en su casa is the tagline on the radios here (stay in your house). I only started studying Spanish since I arrived here 80 plus days ago amidst a pandemic. The deal in coming here was only to take care of my grandfather, live expense free, learn Spanish and weather the COVID storm.   1. I politely declined.   2. Since then the architect for his project has been charging my father and not working. He did not like my presence (obviously) and had problems with me. I have caught him talking behind my back before already.    3. My father refused to pay some grocery bills he promises are free.    4. My father kept making excuses for the architect´s disrespect of me due to his troubled home life (little did I know he was a hardcore Mexican national who only speaks fast Spanish. I never asked him to speak English because I thought he was being supportive of my language goals. Turns out he (an employee) felt entitled and tried to power play me (the employer)).    5. Now they turned off the A/C in the summer as retaliation for me deciding not to talk to any of the for 7 days. Unannounced. So passive aggressive. Or perhaps the architect did that on his own. Who knows. I have working fans, but if they start to shut off the water and power I may have to go back to COVID USA. I will not submit to control. 7. Etc. My decision is far more than a reaction to my current situation. I have thought about this since I was a kid. It has been on my mind of 19 months of travel. The house is in their name. Technically, they could take it away at anytime. However, they would not. We grew up getting sued by my mother´s brother since she got a betrothal from her father (in millions). My parents grew businesses out of that. He claimed we stole the money. Long story, short they would not do that because they would be becoming the very monster who they have been fighting all their lives. Someone who felt entitled to a gift they received. Given that, I have always wanted to not be like my mother´s brother. Giving my two sisters my inheritance and living a free life is what I would want. It´s a gamble to do it now. We are about to see a resurgence in COVID. The economy probably will not bounce back in the USA until 2021. However, I have this strange sense that once I jump into the void all will be provided."
none,"Hi all,Going to give a hypothetical situation then my own.Boeing transferred X manager from Seattle to Tolouse, France to manage a team of 10 French professionals. The agreed upon language is English via company policy. One team me ever refuses to speak English to the new manager who only has an elementary level of French.What does that new manager do?Option A - enforce the company rule as a show of power (and on the side learn French as fast as possible to show respect to the new country you are living in). The manager can even mention his elementary level and say he is happy to speak French after work about non related topics if you would like to help me improve. Option B - struggle hard to speak French to your subordinate.The problem with this is:A. It puts the manager in a position of supplication to a subordinate.B. It infantilizes the manager and lessens his intelligence because he cannot effectively communicate in French.C. The manager is allowing a breach in company policy which he is supposed to uphold.What do you think? My situation:I am here in México taking care of my grandfather. My father simultaneously has some construction projects he wants me to oversee. I took four years of high school Spanish then started again when I got here after 9 years of no Spanish.

An old school Mexican nationalist who refuses to speak any English (he speaks English). I was naive of the above power dynamic so I defaulted to my natural I'm going to do my best to speak Spanish to respect the country I am in” attitude.I realize that his intention is not to help me speak Spanish. It is one of you are in my country so you MUST speak Spanish.”I get that but what reverses that dynamic is that we are paying him and my father gave me supervisory control I've this men. Framing his attitude and refusal to speak English as insubordination in this context.His nationalistic attitude is a much more toned down version of a white Texan guy yelling at a Mexican American woman for speaking Spanish to her Mexican American friend in a store (I recall seeing a video of this). Furthermore, I observed that my efforts are not even appreciated. He expects it. He didn't expect it from my white grandfather or white aunt when he built their home. I know this from watching the interactions myself. Why do I get treated differently? Now my father is white so he gets the wow factor of speaking Spanish. I have some color to my skin so I'm slotted in the Mexican American who doesn't speak Spanish but we expect him to because he looks like it” slot. Now an easy place to be. I feel for the Chicanos here.I've decided to speak only English to him and Spanish to his workers because it's dawned on me that I've been licking his boots where it should be the other way around. It's too bad because I have put 225 hours into studying Spanish since I've been here. I'm getting better. But I don't tolerate disrespect especially when we are providing business in a down economy.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), they say the left side is the feminine side (receiving) and the right side is the masculine side (pushing outwards/forward) of the body. My guess is that I either work too much and need to build my yin by resting and/or something about my feminine side is weaker than my masculine (right side).Thoughts?P.S.

I myself notice that the more I live life the less I care about someone insinuating I had a problem with alcohol before. My case - had dinner with my grandfather tonight. I mentioned how I met a former Fortune 500 CEO that stopped drinking alcohol 42 years ago on a meditation retreat. He told me stories of Chinese businessman who put him in high pressure situations where they wanted him to drink (cultural business practice). He had millions on the line. He still refused to drink. I said, ""Now that was a real man of integrity.""I noticed he started to reel as if he took it personally. I don't drink at all half the year. Never had a problem. Etc.The same insecurities that come up in a lot of people that ask if I drink alcohol. The responses get predictable whether they are immediate or take time to simmer. He then did something a bit devious and subtle. He spoke about how his son's latest wife had two sons with another man. One committed suicide. He started drinking then doing pills. I know he committed suicide, but I didn't know pills were involved and I said that. Then he said, ""If you can't handle the juice Sauce, then don't drink it at all.""He then paused and looked at me.I got the message - ""You probably had alcohol problems which is why you don't drink it PopularTradition.""Something magical happend.I didn't care. I glossed over it and asked if sauce was slang for alcohol. I've never heart of the term. I saw his heart sink a bit. He realized I didn't let the insult stick at all. It flew off me.This came with a lot of time and practice (Vipassana meditation to be preceise) and learning to take people less seriously (not in a demeaning why). For those that are teetotal and never had a drinking problem, how do you deal with these inaccurate/unfair insinuations?"
none,"TLDR - Grandpa is unconsciously racist. So are his friends. I am supposed to be his caretaker alongside his nurse who comes 4x a week. However, he keeps condescending me with subtle and sometimes more over racist remarks. I called him out. I've talked to one Aunt about it. And I'm honestly thinking about just doing my own things and avoiding him. The problem is that he needs social contact and isn't eating enough on his own. The nurse reports he is getting dizzy. Background:I was asked by my father to take care of my grandfather in Mexico last minute before the borders to Mexico closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am a Filipino-American. White passing, but I tanned my skin since I was 10 because that felt more like me. My grandfather is in his 90's and served WW2. He has been in Mexico for six months of the year for over 40 years and was stationed in Panama for most of his service. He still cannot conjugate in the present tense in Spanish. He doesn't speak it. Nor do his friends. Watching him is odd. He is went to college on the GI Bill ([which we all know practically excluded minorities](https://www.amazon.com/When-Affirmative-Action-White-Twentieth-Century/dp/0393328511)), lives off his Social Security (which we won't live off of at all), his teacher's pension (they are called 401k or 403b's for teachers), and two of his six kids got wealthy and support him. As I grow some facial hair or get more tan here he says I am looking like a native everyday. I called him out on his racism and other condensing remarks followed by an email on boundaries. We talked about that email and he called compared me to a ""dog peeing on a fence."" I told him the connotation there is negative. He is comparing me to an animal therefore the implication is that I am [subhuman](https://theconversation.com/why-its-so-offensive-when-we-call-people-animals-76295). His rebuttal was that humans are more like animals and he grew up spoiled. Then he changed the subject without apologizing.I told one of my Aunts. She apologized on his behalf. He is from another time. There is nothing I can do to change his views at this point. He is pretty lucid. His daughters all call him a narcissist which brings another complexity to this. He has a nurse come 4x a week now. I cook for him and just leave food for him even if he doesn't want to eat as my aunt's have advised. However, worse than the insults, I don't want to remember my grandfather as a racist. Perhaps worse, I don't want to think about if my great grandfather or great great grandfather would see me as subhuman if they met me as a stranger or were properly introduced. Solution I hear around here and family:1. Don't take it personally.  It comes from their programming/rearing. 2. See the bigger picture.3. He is old.4. He is family. 5. When the nurse is gone he is here by himself. However, we all have [basic human rights](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201501/how-spot-and-stop-narcissists). A few relevant ones: **You have the right to say no” without feeling guilty.**    **You have the right to be treated with respect.**   **You have the right to express your feelings, opinions and wants.**   **You have the right to set your own priorities.**   **You have the right to take care of and protect yourself from being threatened physically,**    **mentally or emotionally.**  **You have the right to create your own happy and healthy life.**I was scaling back on my contact with him until my Aunt called me. He is getting dizzy because he is not eating. The nurse is only $50 a day. So far he is paying for her. Any of his six children can easily pitch in for the other 3 day of the week. In this case, is protecting myself emotionally and asserting my rights worth it at the potential cost of my grandfather's life? He won't change. It really does seem my only options are to distance myself, walk completely, or grit my teeth get through it."
none,"I'm a home cook asking other home cooks since I feel professionals don't have a choice.Lately, I've been cooking for someone who low key insults my food and spends two hours during dinner talking without asking me a single question. I'm a bit demotivated to cook for someone so self centered. I feel like my body automatically gets tired and I no longer have as much energy/inspiration to cook.I'm a decent home cook.

My bad for not clarifying. Not sure why I am getting downvoted."
none,"TLdR; Went on an over year journey. A lot of areas of my old life fell apart before I left. Friendship betrayals, ex coworker put downs, family putting me down, no support. Lots of resistance for what I wanted to do. The theme of my journey was self compassion and taking my power back. A particular Aunt asked me to come over to her house before I left. Open up. I did. Then she took the chance to beat me down. Now I'm coming back. That same Aunt is texting me on Whatsapp. Do I bring up the past or just be ready to be assertive if it happens again?\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Many messed up betrayals and put downs occurred from family, friends and former coworkers before I left on my journey (no contact to anyone). One of them was an Aunt that invited me to her home to open up about what's going on in my life. Then she took the opportunity to put me down, call me a ""little boy"" and suggested I get a transgender surgery. I have a feeling the attack came about because I told my father I am keenly aware I am the last man to pass our name down the line. That Aunt is a strong feminist who thinks she is the ""patriarch of the family."" My father never admits it, but I think he told her. I never told any relatives I was aware of this .Very classic - Woman - ""I want my man to be more vulnerable."" Man - ""Okay strap in for this ride..."" Woman - ""You disgust me and I no longer respect you..."" Famed TED Talk Psychologist on Vulnerability, Brene Brown, had a man ask her why she doesn't study men. She said she didn't have data. He said oh that's convenient because my wife/daughters would rather me die on my high horse than see me vulnerable. Now I am isolated during the corona virus. I decided to go to a foreign country to take care of my grandfather who is all alone. Luckily, none of my family members can just barge in and see me (borders to US closed). Family is doing weekly Zoom meetings and Whatsapp. This particular Aunt solo messages me saying, ""thanks for taking care of Gpa. I am reading this book called ""Late Bloomers (link below)."" Every word reminds me of you...and me.I gracefully thanked her and mentioned all my above average achievements. I just burnt out. I was living the vision of someone else for me and not me. She hasn't responded in three days. It came off as really condescending, but that book she recommended looks great. Prior to this I confronted my Grandpa asking why the men of the family don't defend each other. He basically said that Aunt did a lot for him and I had to forgive. When I had the courage to ask that directly I realized how much hurt I was in still. Despite all the meditation.**Question** \- do I confront this Aunt in an Assertive way or keep working (meditation) to get over it and be ready to be assertive when she tries to power play put down again? Unfortunately, I was about to settle into a city, get a job then a therapist, but Corona threw that off. Therapists cannot practice with clients from another state. I feel like leaving everything behind no contact is the silent treatment. An ultimately passive aggressive move. You can only: A. Change the situation,   B. Accept it, or   C. Walk away. I chose C since it was shitty so B was a no-go. I had no energy for A. Now I am slowly coming back to the family but have trust issues. It's only a matter of time for a narcissist to resort back to their old ways once they feel like they are in control of you again.

none,"Hi all,Currently using my quarantine time to learn Spanish. At first, I was aiming to take the C2 CERFL test in six months to prove my fluency for business purposes. However, my tutor told me about the [DELE test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DELE) which is apparently far more difficult. He said that costs $400, is in person only (unlike the CERFL) and lasts a lifetime. I do not know how much the CERFL costs. Is there a difference between these tests and how they are recognized around the world? It'd appreciate it if you all could help me pick one so I can start studying specifically for it now."

none,This question applies to the below context as well as other contexts you all normally are in. The contexts here is odd - the second to last day (talking day) of a 10-day meditation retreat. I mention this because it's not some club where I can be more aggressive. I and everyone else was feeling elated.I'm between the women's and men's dining area in the book area where men and women can talk. Segregation took place for 10 days.Now a woman who asked me for a ride on the way there was all over me. I didn't want her but she was so eager to talk. We were in the middle area on two chairs.One guy approaches form the side to join the convo and another guy (29 and the first thing he told me was all he could think about was sex when silence broke) jumped into the convo later.Later the woman said both guys gave her a bad vibe. Like hungry hyenas. And they were. I didn't want this woman so after a bit I excused myself and walked. Then she started friend-zoning me hard which got annoying. In that context I wonder what I could've done?1. Left before any dudes appeared which could've worked since it isn't perceived as a battle lost. Or2. Kept my body turned towards her and not even acknowledge the guys. Ignoring is tough in this context because it makes me look unfriendly when we are all supposed to be happy/compassionate and what not (which was how I felt which is why I was being nice). 3. I couldn't tell them to piss off since now I'm showing too much interest in the woman.4. Try to dominate and shift the conversation towards me and not listen to what they thought.It's a weird one. On the street or club I may say do you know anyone in this group? No okay bye.” Then back turn.That May be harsh even for the bar/club and definitely shows a lack of social calibration/grace.Thoughts?
none,"I'm all for the LGBTQIA community.   I love Mexico and am currently in Mexico.   I'm all for family first.But how Dominique was treated in this show was beyond messed up. I get it - one issues at a time Mexico. Perhaps LGBTQIA is more trendy for the young progressives in Mexico City rather than fixing racism and even deeper - poverty. It's easier to call out too. But my man Dominique pushed through nonetheless: Half the time he was being called a ""Negrito"" behind his back.   No one really accepted him.   He knew about Paulina cheating on him and still kept his cool.  He even learned Spanish! But this poor brother was swept under the rug with a steamy cabaret dance/post make out session and some light hearted music. My mother is from the Philippines. I get colorism. It's in Brazil. It's obviously in Mexico. Chinese in the B.C.E. used to believe those with darker skin were poor because they had to work in the fields outside. Similar types of attitudes spread across the world in different hues of ignorance to hate. But she gets off the hook because he kept his cool and she missed her family? I don't recall her ever asking if he wanted to move to Mexico. It's obvious he was making steps by learning Spanish for her. What's going on here from both a cultural and power dynamic level?1. Was Diego too cool and didn't generate any attraction for Elena, Aka the typical ""Nice Guy""2. Was racism/colorism a larger aspect in her leaving him and her whole family resisting him? 3. Did Paulina have a right to be angry at Dominique for knowing about her cheating and still being cool?   1. The only counterpoint here is that if he never shows anger or brings it up then he likely is someone to never bring up issues he has with his significant other leading to lots of passive aggressiveness (but he didn't strike me as the roommate that leaves sticky notes everywhere). 4. Why would the writers/producers even include an African-American?    1. Just to subtly put the guy down for being black?    2. To imply that Mexico is about the LGBTQIA and fixing racism is not on our radar?    3. To show that the Latino man is superior to the black man?    4. To perhaps reveal racism/colorism in Mexican culture in a sly way to the audience? Dominique had no recourse. He should never hit a woman. But he certainly is in a foreign country with a powerful family. He'd get destroyed. He couldn't yell at her either. The man had no avenue to express his rage in this country and situation. His boundaries were completely crossed. Paulina just nexted the dude after a marriage and we are supposed to accept that?Hope other folks on this sub aren't so easily blinded by happy music and sexy scenes to reply objectively."
none,"I took a big leap for myself in my Spanish studies - I hired my first iTalki language teacher today for a 30 minute trial. Over 800 lessons. 4.9 stars. His intro video has a professional microphone and crisp audio. Solid reviews. From Colombia.I turned on my video and audio. I asked why he didn't turn on his video. He said it was because he was saving power. I know the currency in Colombia is $1 to 4,092 Colombian Pesos right now, but this was odd. \*Is this a red flag or some sort of safety measure on his end or the actual situation over in Colombia during this global pandemic? I have another lesson tomorrow with him. Personally, I thought he was a bit aggressive and fast talking. I didn't get a great vibe or felt like we connected. However, he was on point with finding my level of Spanish + PDF visuals. I figure I need to find a male teacher instead of a female one because (as a man myself) it is useful to develop that accent. Thoughts?"
none,"Like a few folks out there I got banned without explanation. No accusers where named. No evidence provided. I didn't even know what I've been accused of.Used BnB for over 70+ stays with 53 out of 54 positive reviews.I can appeal but how can I appeal Something I don't even know about?It sucks. My first thought is this is a blessing in disguise. Try other apps for 6-12 months.Then appeal BnB to see if they're in the mood to reinstate my account.Cute how much money I've spent on the platform (they are a corporation). But that may not work.Another thought would be to create a fake account and hope I can get by without a government verified ID, but they may see my name and the name on my CC don't match.But that may not work either.A larger concern would be when I want to list on BnB. I can probably create a business account and use a friend or business partner's name as the official owner.Not sure if there is a workaround but I'd like to hear it if so."
none,Have you had struggles around substance abuse? Yeah...I find this to be a subtle clap back from folks that do drink alcohol/do drugs upon hearing I renounced them. Like why can't I just quit because I want to or because I finally listened to my body screaming out that this substance isn't for me?It's like consumers cannot comprehend someone quitting drugs and/or alcohol unless they had a serious problem with it that caused them to quit.Anyone else get this or would like to share other subtle and not so subtle condescension (or wild reactions against) our collective decision to live a sober life?Note:Personally - gave up drugs in Spring 2018 and alcohol in the Fall of 2018. Sober and completely clean ever since. Never had any addictions. Successful in corporate America. Parents rarely got drunk and never did drugs. No addictions in any extended family member.

I was crystal clear that I was seeing if I wanted to move to the area (true). Went (8) times. Cancelled the membership in person w/ the same guy who signed me up. He had to get his manager. ""This rarely happens."" She looked me in the eye and said I wouldn't be charged. I get charged for the first month. I email the guy and he says it's an odd technicality with corporate. I needed to go to the gym (8) separate days. One day I did a morning and evening. (7) different days, but (8) sessions. Whatever. I tell him I don't mind paying the first month. Please ensure it is cancelled. Ok Ok. Next month I'm charged again!Disputed this 2nd charge on my CC.Gold's Gym never stopped calling and emailing. Blocked both. (6) months later a man (sounds like he is from India) claims to be from a third party collections agency. He is collecting my debt from Gold's Gym. He claims to have called a lot (though he never left a voicemail).  I tell him I have everything in writing. It's cancelled. He says he needs my permission so he can keep calling. I ask to speak to his manager. He asks the same question. I say yes and tell him to transfer me. Hangs up.He hasn't called in two weeks now. Super sketch. That was a great Gold's Gym (in terms of equipment and cleanliness), but damn do they have the unethical business practice part down pat."
none,"I ran into this below YouTube video that advocates hitting a rep, stop, stand up, reset and pull again. Before I was doing a stop-go which killed my back. I'm far better off now and have made good gains with this approach.https://youtu.be/uh2W4jLPdDINow I'm wondering if I have been doing it all wrong - a slow, controlled lower to the floor?Is a DL complete once it's pulled to the top and a slow lowering puts unnecessary strain on the back that doesn't lead to strength/hypertrophy? If so, I could be saving my back and a lot more energy.If not, then I'm doing it right.Thoughts?"
none,"Hi all,TL;DR - I'm a form perfectionist. Full ROM on everything. Even hands to shoulders on weighted dips which many argue is and (not gymnasts though).  I never knew it was hurting my gains. I also didn't realize there is benefit to killing muscle ups, explosive shrugs and the push press in helping key lifts.Any other secrets out there??And has anyone used a lifting coach and gained a lot from it? ———————————I'm getting a gas line installed at my house. The PM on the project is this cool 180lb dude who set a few lifting records in that weight class (not world). He recommended the following for me:1. Practice shoulder shrugs to get use to heavier loads psychologically. 2. If you aren't hungry after a workout you're not lifting enough. 3. A lifting session shouldn't be over 45 minutes.4. Master the grip on the DL and use cross grip over 2x overhand.5. I left 365lbs for 5 reps on the DL. At 6' 2” 218lbs he immediately balked and said I should be doing 500lbs easy by now (I've been lifting since 2013. That would be elite level on many strength standards, but it's encouraging to have someone say that. Expanded my horizons and belief in my body). 6. Leg Press to improve the DL. 7. This is what I discovered recently on YouTube, but hit a rep, stop, stand up, reset and next rep. It's saved my lower back. No need to touch and go so quickly. The shoulder shrugs stuck with me. I never thought of doing an exercise to simply get use to the heavier weight. Also, never thought of using my hunger as a gauge as to how hard I worked. The Power of the Push Press:Another older gentleman at the gym recommended I push press to improve my shoulder press. I told him that doesn't really train the shoulder muscles specifically but he said it does work the lock out and again the psychological benefit of lifting heavier weight sans perfect form. Form Perfectionist - A Limiting Belief?!I've always been someone to balk at kipping pull ups and jumping T-Bar Rows, but I'm starting to see their benefit in a limited space. Sometimes you need to cheat on form to achieve muscular overload like eccentric ab wheel rollouts or one arm pull ups or kipping muscle ups to get used to the movement. Another breakthrough area for me - Squats:After years of being an adamant ATG guy with lots of lower back soreness on a squat session I decided to go an inch below parallel (low bar Mark Rippletoe's style). I figured if I could seal row 250lbs I could do 315lb squats. Sure enough pumped out 4 reps for the first time ever! Working with the body is easy, but against the mind is far harder. Psychologically, it was a breakthrough for me to have that much weight on my back. To me it felt like a half squat since I've been so adamant on ATG, but I finally accepted:A. The maximum effective ROM doesn't go past an inch below parallel (been lifting 7 years and never knew that!). B. I lack the active flexibility to stop the butt wink at the bottom despite having hyperflexed ankles. perhaps my body isn't suited for ATG. Why all this ignorance from an experienced lifter? - Limiting BeliefsI used to be a huge body weight training guy. A true zealot. I scoffed at weightlifting with heroes like Bruce Lee and stereotypes about the inflexible meathead keeping me from the iron. Obviously, I moved away from that and the iron has helped me in more ways than one. Anyone else have key lifts where an accessory lift performed with subprime form benefit the key lift in some way?"
none,"Tl;Dr - hostess leaves me a false review. I can prove it is wrong with pictures and even the contact of her property manager. BnB won't remove her review because it doesn't violate content guidelines. Other than respond to it with a comment - what do I do? So I stayed in a BnB with a lot of red flags. I started to ask some more questions and the host got defensive. She claimed that she doesn't make money off the property and isn't being evicted, but is moving out. She also did not disclose the 7 am construction noise in the condo next door being renovated. Luckily, I ran into her property manager. He told me I was the first guest to tell him the truth about being a BnB guest. Everyone else was trained to lie. He told me she was being evicted and has been lying to them about her BnB ring for a year and a half.They gave her a three day notice to leave.Of course I'm pissed that this woman lied to my face while being defensive about all my questions. I left an honest review for the hostess, but she left a dishonest review of me where she claimed:1. She was choosing to leave.2. I left the her place in a filthy condition.3. I took a dump in her toilet and left it there.Reality:1. She was asked to leave and I called the property manager this morning who agreed to back me up with BnB.2. I always take after pictures and can prove the unit was in good shape.3. I did not leave a turd in her bathroom. That is not my style. Also, I got a full refund for all nights from BnB plus a $55 coupon. I was taken care of.Now BnB is saying her false review does not violate their content policy. However, I can absolutely prove with time stamped evidence and witnesses that it's false.Thoughts?"
none,"Hello,Tl; Dr - hostess advertises a kitchen under amenities which I filtered for. After cooking steak and cleaning throughly she mildly freaks out saying the kitchen is only for light cooking. She is a real estate agent use to legal puffery, but in my opinion it's listing misrepresentation. I'm in a BnB here in Southern California. I specifically filtered by kitchen” since I cook to save money. I cooked steak on my first day in the hostess' open kitchen. Vent fan on max.Garden sliding door open.Wiped down stove after use.Washed, dried and put away all dishes and pans.I come home later that night. I greet my hostess. She says nothing. She doesn't even turn her head from watching her nightly Netflix.I see some essential oils and comment on them positively. She then mildly freaks out:1. The kitchen smelled and all her clothes smell like steak one floor up from behind a closed door with a door seal on the bottom. 2. She had to burn incense for hours and get a diffuser to rid the place of the steak smell (again not fish, steak). 3. The BnB listing says the kitchen is only for light cooking like soups. She doesn't even cook in her own kitchen. She told me to look upstairs at the paper in my roommates with house instructions. It should say kitchen is for light cooking.Discrepancy!A. The sheet in my room said nothing about kitchen restrictions. B. The BnB amenities included a kitchen for any guest cooking needs. C. I did see something I hadn't seen before saying the kitchen is only for coffee and tea in the fine print. I don't remember seeing that. I think she added that on the sly. If this is true it's listing misrepresentation on her part. 4. She told me to use the grill outside. I agreed to get this woman to chill. Tried the next day and the grill doesn't work. 5. Then she suggested if a kitchen is what I'm looking for maybe move to another BnB.6. The most perplexing was that she mentioned if it's just the two of us it's okay, but there is a bedroom for another guest. What if they were here? Well there is no other guest now or when I started cooking lady.... but I respect your home so I'll accommodate you? I think the host should be the one accommodating. 7. On my arrival she let me put items in her fridge and cupboard. I don't know why she would've thought I didn't cook if I put fresh food in her fridge (she saw) and a plethora of spices in her cupboard (which she reorganized because she just got rid of ants there but I only had spices so she basically touched my stuff without permission and admitted it). I've been to 70+ BnB's. I've never been to one that advertises a kitchen you can't cook in. Usually they just don't list the kitchen as an amenity. I'm a calm guy. This is a new situation. I'm only here for two more nights. I dealt with it well, but I don't think a guest should be accommodating a host. In the name of hospitality it should be the other way around. Now I'm wondering if I should have stood up for myself more or if I handled the situation well. I am curious how you all would've responded given your a guest like me that values the kitchen."

none,"I'm Filipino-American. Due to Spanish colonization my Filipina mom (born/raised) is white passing. My father is white American.However, at a young age I always wanted to be more Filipino (lived there for two years as a kid). I tanned my skin with natural sunlight for years only to find I am racially ambiguous to most folks. Ancestry tells me I am 75% European and 25% Asian (Filipino, Chinese, 1% central Asia from my dads side). I do have a dual citizenship - USA/PH. The last piece of the puzzle for me to shut folks up is mastery over Tagalog. Maybe loosen up on the tan to become a white passing minority since many Asians like white folks and dark skin is looked down on, but that's not me. This is who I feel I am. When I tell Asians or Asian-Americans I'm Filipino-American I get mixed responses. Usually the Asians are more subtle in their approval or distaste than Asian-Americans. The Chinese get pissed. Visibly show it the most. The Vietnamese don't want to accept it either.The Japanese are usually suspicious subtlety. Any central Asians I've met lack a superiority complex or just don't care for an opinion.The one Korean-American I told let it bubble into anger over time. Filipinos generally understand. Some that have been born and raised there know how diverse our country is (Spanish colonization for 333 years so there are white Filipinos like my mother). The Filipino-Americans are a bit more vocal with their distaste that I claim to be F-Amer despite never having been to the Philippines themselves or Boeing how to speak Tagalog. I guess culture is all in the looks?....Do any of you get this kind of suspicion or distasteful reactions from people?"
none,"Hi,First off please disclose if you are a host or have only been a guest to expose bias.Currently on hour 4 of my stay. I've stayed at 70+ BnB's but never have I stayed in a city where BnB is being actively fought.So prior to arrival my host calls. Her name is Mary and see her picture on her BnB profile. The woman that calls me says her name is Susan. She is her sister. I feel catfished and get suspicious. All the reviews mention Mary and how Mary lives in the unit. I asked about the set up prior to arrival voicing my need to know how the space is used.I was told host is in one wing of the condo and two guests have their own bedrooms. The hostess asked me to arrive at 3:30 pm because she has to get back from school (teacher). Then she had to leave at 4:30 pm before my arrival to teach a night class. She says she will see me later tonight after her night class (I'm still not at the unit at this point). After I arrive she texts me on the side (I hate when hosts try to get me off the BnB app) asking me to lie:Tell other residents I am Susan's personal guest.Reason being is the city is fighting over BnB, but I'm thinking condo management may have banned it.Arrived:Surprised to find the hostess does not live in the unit and it's one two bedrooms. I text her saying I prefer to take to her via the BnB app. She leaves a voicemail saying water is off from 9 am - 2 pm tomorrow. She is back home somewhere and doesn't come back to the unit to meet me as promised. Lastly, she says she can't see any BnB messages....Suspicious.I usually play along and would be the cool guy, but I don't like to have to lie to every person that chats with me in the condo jacuzzi. This is a terrible place to put a guest. Also, I don't know if this setup is legal. Lastly, I'm not sure if the sisters are working together or if they had a fight and one took over.The reasoning was that they had to put Mary's face/name up instead of Susan's over this city wide BnB fight.What are your thoughts and my options?1. I could get out before 24 hours for misrepresentation and potential illegal activity and being asked to lie.2. I could be cool with it and lie for them (against my ethnics). 3. I could ask for a slight reimbursement for the inconvenience of this whole situation (yeah I know some of you hosts don't like this but I'm being asked to do something unethical and outside the realm of guests. It's also a suspicious situation I've never encountered before.Edit:This BnB is Southern California."

none,"So I've seen this floating around some comments here with people confirming the following:N-parents have an us against the world mentality.My nparents constantly put down relationships with other subtlety and had a general distaste for others. They were both charismatic, but they lacked real friends. My dad had two shaky guy friends and my mom had a few female girlfriends who I finally saw were mostly jealous of her. No friends from the opposite sex. Does anyone else observe this in their n-parents?Does anyone know why this is?"
none,Here in California - my car was stopped at a stoplight on red. To my left was a left only” turn lane. To my right was another lane going forward.A moped pulls to my left and scoots in front of my car. I've never seen that happen before. I know motorcycles can drive in between lanes in some countries which help in traffic. California is the only state in the US that doesn't ban lane splitting. But I've never seen them try to get ahead on the left side of a car in the lane furthest to the left going forward in parked traffic. Is this illegal or is it just a legal move I've never been aware of?
none,"Hi all,I'm working my way up to the Full Lotus (Padmasana) for hour long sits as per my Vipassana practice. I realize it will take me 2-3 years and a major requirement will be to get into that posture without hands. So now I am starting with the [Burmese Sit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yZrJh5YrdE). The problem I am having is ankle pain. I sit like this on a bed to do my hour long meditation sessions. I believe this is a lack of hip flexibility that doesn't allow my knees to rest on the ground. Questions:1. Am I right in my diagnosis of the problem?2. How can I work to fix it?    1. I imagine sitting on a cushion so that my knees are below my hips - something I already do. 3. Are there any PNF stretches to help with hip flexibility?4. Is there a possible emotional component to my inflexible hips? (Thinking [The Genius of Flexibility by Bob Cooley](https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Flexibility-Smart-Stretch-Strengthen/dp/0743270878)). Currently I am six inches from the floor on both front splits. 16 inches on the side splits. Rusty on my back bridge but can hold it. But decent hamstring flexibility. I can get my knees to the ground with back straight parallel to the wall on a butterfly sit (It takes a lot of time). And I am a dude so I may lack natural hip flexibility. Far better than average, but it seems my hips and shoulders are my weak points."
none,"Hi all - 27 year old male here. So I moved out of my family home (and evening state) and went LC with both nparents. Before the move my nparents did a lot of messed up things to get me to stay. Then went NC with my nmom after she illegally opened my mail without permission, sent me pictures of the mail opened, then threatened to throw away future mail (a felony) without taking responsibility. She brought up X bad thing I did a long time ago for smoke and mirrors. It really showed me she hadn't changed at all. All the polite and loving emails over the 15+ months I was away were attempts at lovebombing to hook me back in. This email finally exposed the side I grew up with. And I enforced my boundaries politely (thanks but we've been over this. Please do not open my mail without my permission. It is illegal. Then her angry repones then me just going NC). We've had this conversation may times before. I decided to go NC. Email and phone number blocked. I had one supportive female friend ask me about last Christmas. She asked if I talked to my mom. She knew we are in bad terms. I felt that this was society's programming working through her to assume I'm the one who had to reconcile with the person who wronged me. I know she loves me as a friend, but she wasn't raised with nparents. You all were.So here are my questions for you all:1. Do I have to be the one to reconcile with my nmom when she has done nothing to reconcile with me? I would prefer to do not contact for good, but some spiritual folks have told me I'm robbing her of an opportunity to grow. 2. Do you all believe that my soul chose this family prior to birth and I will have to deal with them at some point in the future? 3. I can forgive without being asked. It's tough. But with trust it takes two to tango. And many of us on here know not to trust the narcissist. Thoughts on that?4. As a man in society, you're almost seen as one step away from being a psychopath killer for not having a good relationship with your mom. Comedian Chris Rock even has a bit about that. Want to see how a guy will treat you? Look at his relationship with his mother.” How do other guys on here overcome that and ladies what do you have to say about that? 5. Have any of you had a wedding and didn't invite your nparents? How did it go especially regarding the other family's view of you? Other thoughts?"
none,"This happened a few years back. A guy two years older than me owned a hot dog business. I later lived with one of his first workers who complained about poor pay, late pay and other shady matters. I made the mistake of telling a close female friend of a woman he was dating in my social circle. These ladies like me but detested the guy I lived with. He was very macho and patriarchical. They were strong feminists. Next day the business owner boyfriend calls me out via Facebook message for talking behind his back. He was justified. I shouldn't have even gotten involved unless I had both sides. I believe I apologized over the message. That was it. The right thing to do I imagine. Not very powerful though.My question for you all:What would you have done?Asking him to meet somewhere would be too aggressive. Sending him my cell and saying I'm open to chat about this would've been both polite sounding and confrontational. The reason being is that most millennials hate using the phone to call. Texting is way more convenient. The upside is that if he doesn't call then he chickened out so to speak and I didn't lose any power if you will. If he did call:I'd also imagine he would ease up, we could reconcile better and I'd learn more about his side. And oh it wouldn't be a weak move. Curious what all the social engineers think out there. Sometimes we know we fucked up and will apologize but want to minimize the power loss as much as possible."
none,"TL;Dr - I feel yoga for a nonwhite man is a subtly unwelcoming place that is not a good place to meet new people. I have a few thoughts below as to why. Curious if anyone feels the same way - male or female or other regardless of color or culture. \---------------------------------------------------------------------------I am a fit (12% body fat) mixed race 6' 2"" 27 year old man in the USA. A white passing minority who tans making me racially ambiguous. I started yoga in October 2018. Yin yoga, hot yoga, beach yoga, etc. I've done yoga in over 20 US states and all different times of the day/week/weekend. I'm starting to form the opinion that yoga class is a place to release negative emotions (grief, anger, etc.) rather than a place to meet people. And sometimes I am an easy target for projection of said negative emotions. It clear to me that I am perceived as nonwhite man in a yoga class (whether the projector hates the man or nonwhite part or both or none is a mystery to me - I just know when I'm getting bad vibes). Types of teachers I've encountered:1. The invitation teachers that don't force you to do anything, but give you options that aren't too hard. 2. The crossfit yoga teachers that treat it like an American cardio workout. 3. The yin/nidric nap teachers that are super soothing, caring and gentle. Shoulder compression and singing bowls for the win!4. The Instagram model teachers that are all about hitting the toughest poses (I don't get this often). 5. The teachers that really want you to keep your eyes closed a lot (sometimes I think this is directed towards me because perhaps they think I'm there to give off the [Male Gaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze) or that's there thing). 6. Laid back, smart, but silly teacher that knows how to lighten the class up. Few really do community right. Most people dart out the door after a yoga class right after work. America has that go-go-go money chasing mentality. I've come to accept that I'm only there for mental, physical and spiritual growth. If a conversation happens, it happens. Going into it I knew yoga is a [space dominated mainly by women](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21604851.2019.1583527) \- white women in particular (even in [New Orleans, LA](http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-orleans-population/)). This did not bother me. But I've noticed my presence annoys three groups from most occurrences to least:1. White women    1. Typically the ones that have dreads and smoke weed.    2. The ladies that only kick it with ladies (either because they are awkward, had traumas with men in the past, racist, who knows).    3. Then the super fit competitive ones.    4. The rest can be a toss up. 2. White men   1. They don't expect other men in this space let alone someone they perceived as colored who is unexpectedly flexible. A silent competitive vibe starts to hit me as I catch them looking over at me throughout the class. 3. Nonwhite men   1. This started happening to me in two beach yoga sessions (donation based) simply because I haven't had yoga class with another nonwhite man. There was this brown fellow from Chicago. He was talking to the teacher after class for some time. I waited and then decided to interrupt. I just crouched down to her, gave her a donation, thanked her and went.    2. The second session this fellow arrives late. Lots of room on the beach, but he places his mat less than (4) inches of blank space to my right and (6) inches from my female friend's left. I caught him looking over at me a few times. I definitely got that competitive vibe.    3. My female friend was also irked at how close he was. He could've gone anywhere else.    4. [To me it kinda felt like this Key and Peele skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EtalOOS-eM). For nonwhite women it can be a toss up. Sometimes I walk into a class full of women and no one wants to talk to me or perhaps thinks I'm there to gawk (I do serious work). Sometimes the female yoga teacher knows me and introduces me to the two or three other women in the room. They barely bat an eye or give a halfhearted wave in my experience. I asked my female friend about competitiveness in yoga:She said that she definitely gets that too from other women. She has also shot the competitive vibe at men as well. She told me that she did this because she had issues with her father and was working through them. The men in the class happened to be there. An easy target for her projection. She's cried in hot yoga before which confirms my whole ""space for release belief.""I trust my intuition and don't believe this is all in my head."
none,This goes out to my LA Fitness gym goers:I'm at 120lbs each hand on the dumbells for Seal Rows (I guess it would more accurately be called a chest supported dumbell row) on those benches in front of the dumbells (set to 2 or 3 height) just like the above picture. Example:https://youtu.be/okRsB5f1CucThe above example also shows a typical LA fitness bench by the dumbells. I notice in most LA Fitnesses there benches don't have good clearance at the bottom for an Olympic bar:Here is an example of a Seal Row with both ends of the bench elevated by gym stools:https://youtu.be/6CDqbJk54PEThe problem is not every LA fitness has those stools or has benches with that kinda of clearance.How do the LA Seal Rowers out there manage in a way that doesn't get you kicked out of the gym?

none,"Hi all,I renounced alcohol and all other intoxicants advice per the 5th percent of Buddhism (of course I had many lore reasons and renounced alcohol before Vipassana).I drank Komboucha last night. My date started to feel a little loopy. Apparently it has less than 0.5% alcohol. I started to feel looser too. I wouldn't go so far as to say my perception was altered, but I was feeling looser. From a Buddhist and then Vipassana Buddhist perceptive - what do they have to say about Kombucha or other drinks with 0.05% alcohol?Since I'm 100% abstinent from alcohol I'm looking for the high level (aka Buddha level) answer."
none,"I'm in my late 20's. Moved to a new city. Know no one. It's an uphill battle finding guys my age to kick it with. I don't drink alcohol or do drugs which makes it a bit more difficult.There was a guy my age I met at an Hindu Temple south of Salt Lake City, Utah. He confided in me that he was an illegal immigrant from Mexico but born and raised in The USA. When he asked if I could speak Spanish I only said a bit. Then he started calling me brohana, brochaco, etc.I felt like I got out in a box in his mind. The subtext I got from it was that he was placing me in a category of white guy fraternity bro” (I'm mixed race and told him. Most folks don't think I'm white, but some colored folks think I'm an Uncle Tom of sorts because I sound like Obama - which is just professional in my opinion not white). It almost felt like an international way of saying I'm a basic American by calling me various forms of bro.I say this because I'm not a bro and nor is he. He is a spiritual guy and a musician. So how do I go about telling new male friends my age that I prefer not to be called bro or thought of as one without coming off as awkward?It's an easy way to bond, but I prefer approaching people authentically and that's not me. I am a spiritual guy, do lots of yoga, sky dive, scuba dive, Vipassana meditator, cook, enjoy art museums, weightlifting, environmentally conscious, different cultures, healthy eating, etc. Not into sports, gambling, cigars, hookah, cars, etc. I definitely feel like I have a depth in me that tends to push most guys my age away. Sometimes I compromise by going to the whole bro and dude thing because I'm not sure how else to bond.College was easy. I started a cooking club, joined a professional business fraternity and threw parties in the weekends. I no longer do those things (except cooking) so it's tough to connect with guys in a non- bro/dude” way.Thoughts?"
none,"Hi all,I'm a big Leangains guy (got me started lifting back in 2013). I Intermittent Fasted for about 3 years consistently then stopped. The three days a week lifting Martin preaches stuck with me. Then of course Greg Gallagher jumped on that train and made a hit podcast episode with Christopher Walker (genuinely smart dude but lacks Greg's flash) about how 3 times a week is the golden number.I'm starting to question that. Alan Thrall made a great video (I forget which one) where he had a visual of a gallon jug with a line towards the 3/4ths mark and a line below the 1/2 full mark.He explained stress and recovery by showing if you are too stressed in all or other areas of your life - the total stress will keep you from gaining. Best to find ways to relax and recover.On the flip side, if you have to little stress (below the 50% mark) you won't grow (in that case  add a workout day).The sweet spot between 1/2 and 3/4ths promotes growth in a manageable way. The answer for me is to add a 4th lifting day and experiment. However, life is so variable. Sometimes I have a big project or a girlfriend breakup that really knocks me down.Curious if any veterans have any signs they need to dial up or down either (or both) the intensity of their lifting sessions or the amount of working days they have."
none,"I already know this is casual racism (mixed race white passing with a tan so I'm racially ambiguous to most).Here on the beach with someone living in my apartment complex (white woman). She was saying how she is airy and all over the place and how I'm so articulate and deep.  Cool lady, but I believe I could've made this a teachable moment.I'm born and raised in the US so of course I am articulate at English. It didn't bug me at the time, but now that I think about it it feels off putting. Again I don't think this was overt, but we all know how expansive and insidious systematic racism can be (even amongst nonwhites with internalized racism). How would you have handled it?"
none,"Hi all,I recently stayed at a BnB that claimed to have a pool and Jacuzzi. When I got there the pool/Jacuzzi were dirty and there wasn't enough water in the Jacuzzi. I asked the host several times to at least get the Jacuzzi working. He either dodged or ignored my request (I asked 3 times within the 31 days of my stay). I realize now that if I wanted to get out of the listing with my money fully refunded I should've told AirBnB within 24 hours. Perhaps I was foolish to trust my host to fix it.Now I am thinking about writing a review for the unit.\*Would you consider this listing misrepresentation?FYI if you are a host please mention it so any bias can be out in the open. Alternatively, if you've never stayed at a BnB or have been a host of one please disclose.Edit:This BnB was in Phoenix, AZ during December so the jacuzzi needed no winterization."
none,"Tl;Dr. —- can you share any experiences where you cut a cord and you felt better and perhaps others tried to reach out to you? Do you agree or disagree with anything I have to say below? Anything to add to my understanding?———Cords of attachments have been a tricky subject for me. As empaths, we unconsciously take on other people's negative baggage and give our light away. Of course we can become skilled empaths to stop this unconscious auric huge as per Rose Rosetree's books.However, the gift of compassion is programmed deep into our subconscious. It takes a lot of work to truly keep our energy just with us. It's unnatural because it feels selfish and we feel all the pain around us.As you may know, you cord with anyone you talk to. Activities like more time spent, hugging and sex can intensify the cord of attachment. In many circles I see that it takes (7) years for a cord to cut on its own. Something as simple as a text or phone call can reestablish cords especially with the nefarious narcissist. I'm doing a huge audit of my life. A shamanic practitioner taught me how to cut cords for the good of both parties. It's like a spiritual shower or motivation. Apply daily. What I've noticed:1. Some cord cuttings give me back massive amounts of energy from my third chakra. 2. Cutting some cords causes that person to call or text me.3. More often someone unrelated tot he cord cutting calls or texts me out of the blue. Maybe they sense my power increasing or something unconsciously.  4. I've had psychics tell me a lot of people are taking my energy and I need to cut cords with people I've met. 5. This cord process happens unconsciously. As my Qigong teacher told me, I have no conscious control because my lungs are programmed to take on others grief (in Traditional Chinese Medicine the lungs hold the emotion of grief and virtue of righteousness). He said Qigong is more effective than sitting meditation because the Qi penetrated the subconscious deeper/faster. Upgrading that compassion to a form of compassion where I only help others who explicitly ask for it is necessary to stop me from unconsciously giving away my power. Thoughts?"
none,"Hi all,I met a man on a formal 10-day who told me he did a 10-day in a Canyon by himself. He hiked in all the food/water. Then he played chants to clear the area and had all audio for an entire 10-day on his phone.He told me the only other change he made was to do Anna Panna for 5 days instead of 3. He said his focus was so incredible that he could zoom into a small part of his body and experience a memory from the past. He had no troubles, but was scolded by an Assistant Teacher for doing it by himself in the woods. The reason he gave was an ominous one: there are forces in the world trying to stop the spread of dhamma. These evil forces (alluding to spirits and the esoteric) could've seriously harmed him. He loved it and benefitted from it. Questions:1. Has anyone had experience with a self guided 10-day in nature or at home? Thoughts? Solitude more helpful than a group setting? 2. Would a self guided 10-day be counted as my last 10-day before I can take a 20-day course or no? 3. Any idea on what are these evil forces the AT was alluding to?"
none,"Here is a [link](https://www.dhamma.org/ne/courses/glossary) to the course requirements. My questions:1. What is the difference between a regular 10-day, an old student 10-day and a special 10-day for serious old students only?2. How has your experience been different between a 10-day and a special 10-day (or add the third one of a old student 10-day if you have done all (3))?3. Is a special 10-day necessary on the path to taking a 20, 30, and maybe even a 45 day course to become a teacher? 4. Would you recommend a special 10-day over an old student or even regular 10-day? 5. Any other thoughts or questions?    1. I've only done 4-regular 10-day courses with my Satipatthanna Suta 8-day course coming up this mid-February and possibly serving my first 10-day shortly after that."
none,"I realize this forum has a lot of hosts in it. So please mind your bias if you are a host.Before I checked into my listing for 31 days, I asked my host to put in writing (on the AirBnB messaging platform) that I could get a full refund for days unspent should I feel uncomfortable. It could be as intangible as me not feeling the vibe. I had a bad experience in my last long term stay. I told him that story. He agreed to this in writing on BnB's messaging system. A lot has happened including him hitting my car while pulling out, staring me down one night as I left the unit, not telling me what's bothering him even after I ask many times, and me asking him to make the jacuzzi/pool operational which was mentioned as a feature on his listing. Regardless of what happened, I asked him to make good on his original promise. He declined citing the AirBnB iron clad long term cancellation policy. He also said I'm not uncomfortable (notice he is telling me) and he should have a chance to make things right.It's been three days and he hasn't made things right. In fact, he refuses to have a face-to-face conversation with me or to explain himself in any way. He spends his time working, watching me on his webcams and avoiding the kitchen (shared area). He even walks through the garage instead of the front door. Conclusion:AirBnB isn't holding him accountable to his written promise, but have acknowledged in writing that he broke it.They won't refund me because he refuses to allow the refund. Therefore, he lied to me. And once more by not making any of the issues I've brought up with him right. I've stayed at 70+ BnB's with 51 out of 51 positive reviews. All positive. I'm a decent guy and do my best to be a professional guest. I did get evicted once. The host didn't like me. I asked to have a face-to-face and he chose to evict me. AirBnB refunded me the remaining days because they saw he was in the wrong. However, I don't know what other circumstances they'd force a host to refund. Curious to hear if anyone has been here before and how'd it go for you?"
none,"What would you do? So instead of parking on the driveway I parked on the street. My host backed out w/ his black car and hit my red car. You can see the damage. Not fun to drive with. I give him props - he immediately told me. He owned up to it. And he called his dent repair guy to fix it. Slight paint damage. Day 1 (the hit) - he called the guy to come at a time I couldn't make. Rescheduled.  Day 2 - rainstorm hits and my host's garage is full with cars he is working on. We have to reschedule.  Day 3 - the dent guy comes on time. The dent happens to be on the same panel were I had previous damage. **Pause**. Claim 1 - I got hit. A guy owned up to it. His company's insurance paid out $2k plus while covering additional hidden damages. I planned to fix this when I got settled. I have a Tesla and lead time for parts takes 1-3 months. I still haven't found a city to live in. Therefore, I haven't done this work yet. Dent guy says why not take the $100 I would've charged you and have your host pay you. So I walk to my host's room. He comes out.**Unpause: Conflict!**Host doesn't want to pay initially. He thinks his hit is a moot point given knowledge of Claim 1 above (I disclosed that to him on the day of the hit...). He doesn't agree with paying me, but he will since he gave me his word.It's been 9 hours. No pay yet. And this is a BnB I am in until after Christmas. So if he doesn't pay (WWYD) what would you do?   What would you do or have done differently at any point? Just let it go? For me it's not for the money. It's for the principal of someone owning up to their fault. It's symbolic. If someone sh\*t in your bed and they knew it was going to be replaced next week, then it'd be taking responsibility to clean it up regardless. Or find another solution. Do something. My host isn't poor either. So I do not feel bad for not letting it go. He owns many properties and is successful in sales. $100 isn't much to him. And it's not worth making our relationship sour and/or a bad review out of the (2) he has. **Details**:I did get it in writing that he would let me cancel at any time and refund the remaining days (despite BnB long term refund policy). Other options:1. Report to my insurance   1. My insurance says if there is previous damage on the same panel then an assessor may make it a moot point. And of course I must disclose that.    2. This is not an option. 2. Leave this BnB early   1. I may take this option because I won't be comfortable in the home if he doesn't even make a symbolic gesture to own up for hitting my car.    2. BnB said he will have to modify the listing and I'd have to request it (don't cancel on my end).    3. BnB said if he refuses to honor his word to refund then a case manager will come in. They will take his written agreement and any texts into consideration. They will probably side with me, but it's still a toss up and moving this direction will probably destroy the relationship with him/I. I better be sure."
none,"I recently did something pretty cool - traveled to all 50 US states and (3) eastern Canadian provinces over a 15+ month period.When people ask and I tell them the above the reactions are:1. Genuine interest - rare. 2. Fake interest - subtlety polite or not (i.e. good for you!) - most common3. Masked Jealously (how do you afford this) - more common than one. 4. Disbelief - more common than one but people are smart enough to be subtle about it and test me on geography or places they know. I get it's a lot to tell someone off the bat. I think it depends on the receiver's socioeconomic status. Now I've just settled down in a new city. I notice when I tell people this they don't care or just aren't impressed enough to want to form a connection. What are the inherent dangers of telling the above statement (to those who ask) and saying you just moved to a new city? My thoughts are:1. Admitting you have no connections and therefore social value (despite being adventurous). 2. I'm distancing myself from their reality by admitting such a large achievement in a long amount of time especially to someone chained to their desk. 3. And of course if they ask I would say I'm looking for work which shows I'm not very established at all.4. For women that may want to date me I notice they prefer a man chained to one place then someone who can leave at any time.5. To more international ears they think I haven't traveled to (18) countries and assume this is my first travel experience. A bit snobby but it definitely does happen (have you ever considered traveling outside the US/Canada? Yeah dude I've lived abroad before). On the other hand, it's an uncommon achievement. Most would hit the world before thinking of hitting all of the US in one go."
none,"Hello, I use to work at Amazon/Microsoft in Project Management. So I'm not looking to be an English teacher abroad. Fluently - I only speak English. I am at a unique place in my life where I can choose to work/move to anywhere in the world.Perhaps my limiting belief is the the USA is the best place to make innovations/make money and the demand for English speakers who haven't mastered the country's language is low. Can anyone who has international corporate experience speak to that? Specifically, I'd like to focus on potential corporate opportunities in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.I'd like to add that say I get a corporate gig in Japan - I'd do my best to learn Japanese as fast as I could. However, in the application phase I am in I don't know if it is worth it to apply abroad."
none,"I'm in my mid-20's and have never shot or owned a gun. I've been offered lightly once and now I have another opportunity this Wednesday.  My definition of spirituality is the awareness that you are a spiritual being having a human experience at all times (both being grounded in the physical while understanding the intangible part of yourself at every moment aka being present which is tough). Thereby bringing heaven on earth at an individual level. That definition (for me) comes with the belief in a higher power, reincarnation and other spiritual beings. For me, that comes with morals mainly summarized with do unto others as you would do unto yourself and other spiritual practices. I could go on.  On another note, I'm thinking of taking up archery and would like some feedback on that as well from a spiritual perspective focusing on the below five topics if you have time.  The (5) topics I would like feedback on:  1. Shooting a gun once and never again.  2. Never owning a gun, but going to a shooting range to shoot often.  3. Owning one gun and going to the shooting range.  4. Owning several guns and going to the shooting range.  5. Owning several guns, going to the shooting range and hunting animals with guns only for food.  I'll stop here because I don't believe it's ethical to hunt animals for sport. I take a Native American view on that. Hunt for what you need to eat (I've never hunted before FYI). It's sad to see the buffalo (American Bison) almost became extinct in the late 1800's as a military strategy to choke the Native American food supply. They didn't even utilize as many parts of the buffalo as the NA's did. Hell, many times they left them dead in the field.  But I digress.  All options have an increasing karmic effect since my money would be going to support the gun industry. But is that industry responsible for killing like the meat industry clearly is (from a Vipassana Buddhist perspective)? Or is a gun just a tool and people are the ones who make it karmically good or bad?  I have traveled all (50) US states by myself and much of the world with others. I've never needed a gun and I've lived with white supremacists before (AirBnB - disturbing and I didn't know beforehand).  So why do I want to shoot one?  Maybe it's because growing up the only real criticism others had for my abstention from drugs, alcohol and cigarettes was that I don't know what it's like. They were right. Back then I judged people to be weak if they partook. Everything else was just others trying to justify their bad habits. I never smoked a cigarette, but I did the other two for just under (7) years starting in college. Then I renounced both for spiritual reasons.  Maybe it's because I want to better understand what it means to be American and a conservative viewpoint.Maybe I feel it will help me with third chakra problems.   Maybe I'm just curious.  One thing is clear - I would've be embracing guns because I am fearful or paranoid.  Later, I was introduced to a 10-day Buddhist Vipassana meditation retreat. The fifth precept of Buddhism further inspired me to keep my renunciation.  The precept that inspired me to write this is that one should not kill - the 1st precept.  I realize there are differing views on becoming a vegetarian to uphold this precept in Buddhism. Just like how there are debates of gun ownership within the Buddhist community. However, in Vipassana I was taught a deep version combined with the fifth precept (no intoxication by drugs, nicotine or alcohol).  If you are a bartender or fisherman, then what you are doing is ultimately immoral at the highest levels of Buddhism. You are helping others break the fifth and first precepts. By even being part of the process (an accountant at a fishing firm) you are generating some level of negative karma.  It reminds me of the Japanese term ""Itadakimasu."" It's said before meals as a thank you. But it's deeper than that. You not only give thanks for the food, but give thanks for the person who hunted it, the people who packed the meat, the delivery truck driver, natural processes that made it happen, etc. One word, but such deep, far reaching gratitude.   I was taught in Vipassana that if you eat meat you are breaking the first precept of killing by supporting an industry that kills.  With this large, systematic downstream effect spiritual thinking - what may be wrong with guns from a spiritual standpoint (particularly from a Buddhist standpoint)?  I'll take a stab at it with points 1-5 I brought up above from what I know :  1. By shooting a gun once I am supporting the gun industry by buying bullets from the shooting range. Guns can be used to kill people or animals but some just use them for sport. Should that intermingled nature give me negative karma should I shoot a gun? But I am ultimately handing a dangerous, neutral tool (like a knife) to not kill but shoot paper. I am gaining a new experience, but am losing the ability to say I've never shot a gun. I can imagine a wild legal situation (maybe I was framed for murder) where I'm asked to take the stand and I have to admit I've shot a gun (but never owned) before. That could be used as a line of thinking to convince the jury. Would shooting or never shooting a gun add, subtract or do nothing for my human experience as a spiritual being?  You can also argue (from a Buddhist perspective) that I have an aversion to guns (I do). And I'm Buddhism, all cravings and aversions hold you back from enlightenment. By doing nothing I keep my aversion (I accidentally touch a gun and visibly leave the room). A slower way to deal with this aversion is to keep meditating.  A faster way would just be to use a gun and understand why people hold them so dearly.  2. Same as the above, but I support the gun industry more. And in the wild legal situation a pattern can be built that I am a well trained shooter. Also, I make create an addiction to the sensation of shooting a gun.  3. The positive effect is that if I own a gun it takes that gun out of the hands of another. However, in the wild legal case it becomes easier to show I could be an active shooter. Also, if anyone were to steal my gun I could be framed for a murder. And if I have a legal gun in my car in the wrong state then a cop could pull me over and find me. Spiritually, I'm showing a stronger support of the industry financially and for their marketing team I'm a new customer in X region. But again I struggle. Is buying a knife or (cross, compound or recurve) bow a karmic problem as well?  4. In addition to all of the above, now I have a stockpile of weapons.  5. In addition to all of the above, now I'm breaking the 1st precept. However, I have the chance to kill the animal quickly unlike the torture of chickens or cows get put through (pumped with drugs, overcrowded spaces, etc). The net suffering I cause an animal is much less than the meat industry. But the hunting licenses I buy further support (wild legal scenario) that I am a well trained, well stocked shooter that has ended life with guns before.  **Some Musings on the Long View - Guns and Humanity's Evolution:**  I know we are transition from the Age of Pieces  to the Age of Aquarius. More empaths are being born than ever to help with this transition to better times. I'm going to assume it doesn't necessitate World War 3 and build a gun ownership argument out of self protection.  Glass half full - let's say we all become highly moral enlightened being in the next 200 years. Those kind of folks would never use a gun to kill (except in a rare accident). It would seem a gun becomes a tool instead of a weapon for killing in the hands of an enlightened being. Would being spiritual additionally mean never handing a weapon or tool with the potential to kill (John Wick would kill a man with a pencil)?"

none,"Here at a Supercharger thinking thoughts... https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-superchargingRight now Superchargers charge:1. $0.24-$0.28 per kWh2. (Usually) $0.13 or $0.26 a minute. Given the fact that V3 architecture will take years to upgrade every single global supercharger to V3, how will this change price when we have critical mass for V3? Faster speeds mean the per minute charge can become costly for Tesla since that amount charged would (presumably) remain unchanged, but the amount of electricity being filed out increases. The kWh charge would make more sense as the de facto measurement (unless Tesla wants to pull a Nikola Tesla and start giving away free electricity). Would that charge increase, decrease or remain unchanged? Any other thoughts as Supercharging gets faster and faster?"
none,"....younger women (all races) either don't listen, try to compete or have an aversion towards me. And by older women I mean older white women mainly. Not that others have an aversion. These are just the women that feel my vibe the most I guess. I'm a (27) year old man. Over 6 foot. Athletic build. College educated. Good sense of humor. Well dressed and groomed. It's downright odd. An older woman would talk my ear off (perhaps a form of energy vamping?) and tell me their life story on the first go. Or I could approach them directly (you're gorgeous) with positive reception. But young women won't give me the time of day. I have to work significantly harder. And at the end of the day I get played in some fashion. I have narcissistic parents with a controlling mother (I worked hard to break that enmeshment) and passive father dynamic. My guess is that I still have a lot of female codependencies in my subconscious that these older women see and are attracted to (perhaps I remind them of their son, someone they can control, someone who will listen to them too much, someone who was trained to be a good host by energy vampires, perhaps my mom placed a curse on me for leaving home to grow up/find myself, etc.) With the older women it always morphs into me listening to them unless I look away to show disinterest then they reel me in with a question about myself then proceed to talk about themselves (eerily close to what my nparents do to get narcissistic supply from my light). But younger women find this to be a turn off for some reason. Or maybe I am experiencing so much grief (yin energy) that I don't have enough masculine yang energy. I read the Law of Attraction at 15, but there is a nuance not mentioned. I learned that no matter how many conscious affirmations you make it can't override the unconscious tapes running in your brain 24/7. You need inner child work and shadow work to change that. And most prefer to spiritually bypass. Curious to hear what others have to say. I think this is more of a spiritual problem than psychological because I literally see who I attract into my life and who responded well (or poorly) to me. The patterns are there."
none,"Hi all,I have gone LC and haven't seen my nparents (physically, video, etc) for 15 months. My nmom offered to wire me birthday cash, but asked for my permission (key detail). I said yes and thank you. No more communication.I am financially independent of them. My question is - pros, cons and general thoughts of accepting birthday cash from nparents? My thoughts:Pros  1. Money  2. They are making a tangible effort to reel me back in. Cons:  1. Control - the whole permission part (in my opinion) was to make me ask for it in a way. It wasn't asking for my permission more than wanting to see me show definitive interest/say yes. The reason it wasn't to get my permission because they do not respect me (my experience). It was to reestablish the parent-child roles instead of the equal parent-adult child roles.   2. Cording - getting spiritual here, but even one text, email or call can reestablish a connection. Narcissists are energy vampires. They trained us to be great hosts. I recall opening her email after I replied with a ""yes/thank you"" and felt my left kidneys take a hit.  This may seem odd to you, but it's my personal experience.   Thoughts?"
none,"I'm a dude. And it's not often a woman asks for my cell. But I've noticed when they do they never call back or text me. It could be poor communication practices, overwhelmed with all the dating app attention, weak networking skills, forgetfulness, etc.But if the reason is that they aren't interested, why ask for my cell in the first place? It is some weird flex or subtle power move?Recent Example - met some cool cats in the sauna. Next thing we are all singing together in the sauna. As I am walking upstairs one of the women (23 Yrs old) ask for my cell. I seem familiar to her. She tells me I could do a lot of good work in Colorado. I give her my cell.Totally platonic. I never hit on her at all. If anything, I was hitting on another woman in the sauna we were in. But she left and didn't ask for my number (despite her telling me she would connect me with some healers she knew. She was 43.) Another older woman left her cell at the front desk. I texted, she offered to let me stay in her house for free, and I made her and her daughter dinner. Totally platonic. She was 50 and divorced. Then another fellow after the 23 year old woman. He is impressed with my travels (like she is) asks for my cell. He texts back, we meet for coffee, and have a solid conversation about life. I share what I know to suit his situation in life. The other times I've had this happen I'm always perplexed. I get the culture is that a man initiates and the woman could be shy to text, but why even ask for the cell in the first place?"
none,"Questions:1. How do you respond to this especially when you get it after opening up about your mixed race heritage?2. Does it happen often to you? 3.

Background: I've been called mutt twice now this year: once in Montreal by my conservative alt-right AirBnB hostess and again in New Mexico by some white guy in his 20's after he asked my ethnicity. I don't recall being called that before. I let it go with the Montreal woman, but later found out she was a white supremacist. I did call out the white guy by telling him that was racist but could've been more assertive. However, I was at a party where I didn't know anyone in a new state so I decided not to turn up the heat. I feel like I've been called it before in the past, but it flew over my head. I was both too polite and didn't have the words to place on racial experiences. White Fragility, The Compromise of Color and other excellent works allowed me to see, name and understand racism on a systematic level.

But I don't think someone of the greatest lyricists in hip hop would throw this in there just because it sounds cool. I'm curious about the Wu-Tang's stance on drugs at the time as well as how this relates to the song/time it was written. I know the crack epidemic was big in the late 1980's and 90's (like the opioid epidemic is now). I imagine it negatively effected people they knew. Bringing it to the present - is the Wu-Tang (or just GFK) against recreational marijuana where the government profits on those who use?

none,"Recently I had an AirBnB host who kept shortening my name. I politely kept asking him to refer to me by my full name please (think Benjamin instead of Ben for Ex.). He eventually called me pretentious which I found rude. I addressed him as he asked. Culturally, I understand in the USA it's pretty common to shorten people's names without much thought. You gently remind someone and they get back on track. No big deal. No hidden agenda. In business situations, I've noticed they don't get this wrong. Maybe I would correct them once if anything, but they'd never do it again. AirBnB is a pseudo business in the sense that there is an exchange of money for services, but in the personal space of one's home. What I've noticed is various levels of service, but I've never had troubles being called my first name with other hosts. I'd chalk it up to this host not liking me. On a Social Engineering perspective:Is shortening someone's name a subtle (maybe unconscious) insult or attempt to lessen their power/make them smaller? The first time maybe hard to tell, but after constant reminders the person could be harboring some jealousy or negativity towards you. On another note, I find it to be a good litmus test on if someone doesn't like me or is gradually losing respect for me or perhaps doesn't agree on an issue and wants to take a small subtle hit at me. As long as I don't take it personally, it is a useful tool to gauge someone's perception/relationship of/with me."
none,"Season 4 Episode 5. Rachel passes out for overwork. That's where I am now so no spoilers please.Claim/Concern: as fuzzy/entertaining as this show feels sometimes (no doubt it's intense/emotional), it's sad to see how much we work in America (especially corporate, especially especially lawyers and 3x especially investment bankers). Why hasn't this show sparked greater concern for the insane work ethic in the USA amongst lawyers, I-bankers, regular corporate folk, and Silicon Valley techies? It seems we are all blinded by the Flashing Lights to see the real problem - a cutthroat capitalistic system that lacks compassion by design. (#YangGang see me). Rachel can't even get a day off while doing law school. I think part time for her is 40 hours a week tbh. Inconsistency: I also don't believe these folks can look as good as they do on 5-6 hours of sleep a night + multiple battles/betrayals. I've worked at Amazon corporate. You get the feel of what a run down corporate worker who slowly gets their soul sucked out of them. You aquaint yourself with the progressing symptoms of burnout and PTSD. It's not glamorous. The negativity infects you. The work grinds on you and unless you love it you die a slow death. This is an excellent show. I love it.

none,"I'm currently in day (23) out of (31) on my long term BnB. I'm probably going to ride it out, but I realized I don't like the city (evaluating a long term move). I'm not really vibing with the hosts either.Nothing serious, but the guy told me his girlfriend lost her job (I didn't need to know that) and she's spreading negative vibes all over the place (swearing on phone calls, ignoring me, walking around with an angry face). I've been there. I fee for her. But I'm also a guest and this is a business interaction. It's no longer pleasant staying here. I know many of you that respond here are hosts. And you may not like my below questions. But in the future, I'm curious how would I get out and get the rest of my days refunded? I doubt using AirBnB support would be the route. I have no major reasons. What would work on you granted I had nothing egregious to use against you (just wanted to leave)? I know some may say, Well the policy says no refunds” but anyone can be convinced especially if you are living with them on the daily. Here are my thoughts (assuming no serious reasons like the host is a drug dealer or has no Wi-Fi despite advertising it):1. Ask directly.2. Ask directly and offer that I can leave immediately the moment he gets someone to take my remaining days.3. Number (2) and also offer to wash the sheets and do the room turnover in exchange for a refund for the remaining days + release. 4. Become the roommate from hell without explicitly violating any rules. (Worst option, I know.  And really petty. But if I have to go for a more pressing reason and want my money back depending on the situation I may be incentivized). I haven't asked directly yet. Just wanted some feedback other than ride it out” which I'll do for this BnB. FYI - I have (49) out of (49) all positive reviews over (67) AirBnB's mostly as a private room in a house.

none,"TLDR - acupuncturist asks where my parents are from during first visit and says I have an exotic look about me. Not sure if it's racist and/or I should call it out in the Yelp review. Okay this is an odd one. I was going to an acupuncture session for the first time at a new spot.I get this old white guy. He seems like a cool guy, but at the get go I notice I'm the one who offered to shake hands first. It seemed to me he spent more time listening to me than doing a tongue and pulse diagnosis. He eventually did a pulse diagnosis, but not a tongue check which is always a red flag. Anyways, during our initial conversation he asked where I was from. Seattle. Where are your parents from? Ehhhh it's definitely in the Othering” realm, but it's better than the where are you really originally from.I let it pass. I tell him and he responds Oh I see yeah you have this exotic look about you.” Wut?That's new for me. I'm a man of mixed ethnicity. This is an old white dude who is well travelled (lived abroad for 10 years, been around Europe, but it didn't sound like he visited any places with a nonwhite majority and he gasped when I told him I stayed at Harlem in NYC for a month - it's a good neighborhood dude...). I'm not about to argue with a man about to stick needles in me so I just I've past it. It caught me off guard because I've never heard that before. It had the intention of a compliment or st least no aggression. The fact remains that it's clear Othering and pretty unprofessional to ask for ethnicity in the first (and last) visit. Now I'm mulling over if that's racist and if I should note that in the yelp review (I was planning 3 stars - the guy wasn't so good). He also offered homeopathy and sold it like one session is 10 years of therapy. Lots of BS there. Highly controversial medicine.” All the acupuncturists I've talked to are against it. Thinking I include that as well. 3 stars since it really wasn't a good session."

He doesn't rudely hang up he just hangs up so quickly like he had his finger hovering over the button during the whole call. I've never had a phone call longer than (5) minutes with my Ndad. In fact, I went no contact for a year and called him - all of a (4) minute phone call. Why? My thoughts could be any or a combination of the following:1. A phone call is too personal for a narcissist. 2. He doesn't want to get into the realm of how I am feeling (he's never asked) so after he gets the who, what, where and when info he hangs up. 3. It's low key a power move to be the one hanging up (doubt this but unconsciously it could be a reason within him).4. He is angry and doesn't want to or know how to show it except passive aggressively (after a year of No Contact this reason would make more sense - we've never had an argument - he's always been Mr. Cool - displays of anger are uncouth and signs you are from a lower economic class).

But damn some of the things hosts have willingly revealed to me on the first night are crazy:1. A Chinese National host in Wyoming proudly admitted how she came over here to find a husband for a green card and how she games the US economic system. Also, she is dating her husbands cousin in a weird love triangle but she can't get divorced b/c the green card. She lies to her parents in China that they are still married because they have a whole room dedicated to their marriage. Oh and how she cheated her way into a scholarship back in achina were she finished University and her support of China's intellectual property theft. 2. Political views (really not professional. Sure it's your house but it's still a business). 3. Alt-right conspiracy driven racist and anti-Semitic views from YouTube Truthers”4. How you were adopted” from Russia in your 20's by an American family, currently have no job, and think all blacks are a different species.”5. How sad you are that your military boyfriend doesn't want to commit and how you side hustle selling Mary Kay beauty products. 6. How Christianity is the greatest religion of them all.” Are you a host that unknowingly (or knowingly...) overshares? Are you a guest that has experienced this first day” oversharing effect? What's odd is that day 2 the hosts seemed to have gotten whatever they had in their system out and oddly give me a lot of space. It's weird."
none,"TLDR - unsolicited advice (the kind that isn't thoughtful and implies you don't know what you are doing) is a subtle power play/manipulation from the nparents. It's not in their interest to have a normal adult child to parent relationship. They always need to assert control to prevent you from breaking free. I find it stunning how I am now seeing and naming all the subtle nparent manipulation tactics. Do you all notice this in your nparent relationships? \--------------------------------------------------------------------------I am going through a major transition in my life. Before I left my home I was endlessly criticized for my choice in various shades of subtlety. Family. Random strangers my parents would recruit to convince me. Etc. Even during my journey, my nDad has been offering unsolicited advice via email like so:Insert Bible passage. You know what I think son?  (Me: hold up no one asked...okay here you go -)The text says - insert his interpretation which is a subtle form of throwing shade on my choice of personal autonomy/empowerment. I set a boundary for him to stop providing unsolicited advice. He broke it several times in the following three months. I blocked receiving his emails. Then I told him through text to text anything important. His emails where blocked because he could not respect a boundary. What struck me is that no one in my family has asked how I am doing. How I am feeling. It's an endless barrage of trying to get information they can pass to their friends as talking points or giving me advice. Then I read [this article on Unsolicited Advice](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201012/unsolicited-advice-i-hate-it-you-hate-it-so-do-your-kids). Some lines that struck me:1.  For good evolutionary reasons, to be discussed in a future essay, **we human beings naturally crave freedom**. **We resist control from other people.** We do this regardless of our age and regardless of whom it is who wants to control us. Married people resist control from their spouses; old people resist control from their middle-aged children; children of all ages resist control from their [parents](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parenting).  2.  Unsolicited advice from loved ones can be especially threatening, because of our strong desire to please those persons. It's hard to ignore advice from loved ones, because we implicitly [fear](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear) that failure to follow it will signal lack of love or respect. At the same time, we don't want to follow the advice, because we want to retain our autonomy. In fact, **we especially don't want to follow the advice of a loved one because, each time we do so, it feels like a step toward changing the relationship from one between equals to one of unbalanced power**. By complying, we may be signaling our future willingness to subordinate ourselves to the other person's will. ""Yes, my dear, you are much smarter and more knowledgeable than I, so I'll always do as you say."" **Every act of compliance seems to tighten an imagined noose that the other has around our neck.** The conflict between complying (to show our love) and not complying (to assert our freedom) creates frustration, and frustration leads to [anger](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger). And so, we feel more anger when a loved one tells us how to improve our driving--or our health, or whatever--than we do when a perfect stranger gives us such advice. 3. Commenter:   1.  I often have information (""they're predicting ice this afternoon,"" for example) that my adult daughter (who is busy being a mom and don't always have time to monitor the media) may not have heard. I see now that what I generally do is pass along the innocuous information ""They're predicting ice"" and then automatically follow it with ""so you should be careful on the roads."" As hard as it is for a mother not to say ""be careful,"" I see now that it would work much better to keep my message to the informational aspect and not to add the advice (which of course would not be appreciated because **I'm implying my adult daughter isn't smart enough to figure out on her own that an icy road means she should exercise caution**). 4. Commenter:   1.  There is a boundary. **There's a difference between a thoughtful comment and unsolicited advice that implies you don't know what you're doing, or can't figure things out for yourself**. If a daughter says, I'm going to the store,” and the mom says, Don't forget to take your list. And the lines can get long so make sure you stretch your legs. You might want to charge your phone battery before you leave. You should shop at this store instead, it has a better selection,” **it's all unnecessary and not treating the daughter like a competent person**. There's a difference. Point 4 resonates with me a lot. I remember asking my grandpa where I should go on my road trip since he has been everywhere in the USA. He kept saying stop every 2-3 hours. Get AAA. Carry X in your car....No grandpa do you have any recommendations on places to visit? Nothing. Just the same unsolicited advice. I appreciate the faith you had in me...It's not like I didn't travel 48 states and 3 Canadian provinces by myself. My nMom is particularly controlling. I remember in a rare therapy session I got her to come into she claimed she tried to guide me. More like control. In the same breath she admitted to being the ""shock troop"" that my father used to manipulate me to going to the college he wanted me to go to. The only counter I can think of is a seemingly rude one - ""Please stop giving me unsolicited advice."" Then steps to Full Contact if the boundaries keep getting crossed."
none,"Day 3 here in SLU. I've noticed people like to drive pretty fast. Like 70-80 speed limits are not enough. I don't sense anger or aggression in their driving. It's almost an attitude of nothing personal I'm just trying to get somewhere and this is the how it is.” Similar to what I experienced in NYC. I'm wondering if it's the heat and this is a seasonal behavior. Or maybe everything is so far apart like Wyoming that people want to get to X Towns are like 90 miles part so they kinda need to go fast for psychological relief. For me Chicago was probably the wildest especially going from Chi-town to the Indiana Sand Dunes National Park. Then LA, Miami, anywhere on the I-35 in Texas and in the on the I-10 especially between NOLA, Mississippi, and Alabama. https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=4654990&itype=CMSID"
none,"Hi all,I'm vacationing in Montana. Spent 3 days in Glacier National Park. Gorgeous park. Pristine water. Felt like an ant amongst giants. Montana is a beautiful place. People have been generally cordial. There was something that threw me off at a cafe outside of East Glacier near the town of Browning, MT. This was on my way out of Two Medicine. This cafe was run by kind international students. Two guys in cowboy hats and jeans came in. I've seen some guys with cowboy hats driving past Flathead Lake to Glacier. The only place I saw that was in Texas, parts of Mexico, and Nashville during my travels. No problem with that. The white guy had an open carry handgun and the brown fellow (Native American perhaps?) has no weapon. These guys sat in the back while their girls ordered ice cream. The brown guy approached me out of curiosity. Super thick country Montana accent. Cool guys. They wished me well and left. Now I understand hunting, fishing and pro 2nd amendment sentiments are part of every young Montana man's Tinder profile. I agree with the 2nd amendment too. However, given the recent El Paso, TX and Dayton, OH (and almost every school shooting) shooting recently - I'm not too keen on being around white guys that open carry. I was in an AirBnB in San Antonio, TX making breakfast. Some new guest walks in with an open carry and I'm like dude I'm just trying to make breakfast” in my head. It is Texas though. I know you guys handle your weapons well, but why walk into a public place with weapons? I didn't see this in Missoula, Butte or Bozeman. I'm not here to criticize. Just to express my discomfort and ask for the Montana country man perspective. I wouldn't carry a wakizashi into a Starbucks or restaurant. Most of the world doesn't condone that behavior. It's really just a US oddity."
none,"I've been to 50+ BnB's in the past year (been to US48 states now). I've noticed most hosts don't initiate a handshake. I don't take it personally, but wonder why this is. Many don't introduce themselves because we've had one or two communications before I checked-in."
none,"I went to a steakhouse just now. It was a little tacky if you ask me - pinhole ceilings, hard mat table cover and a paper sheet as the table cloth. My server came in and drew his name on my table with a crayon facing towards me. I found this odd and slightly amusing. He said it was part of the test. I'm not sure if he meant a test for him as a waiter to draw backwards or (more condescendingly) a test that I could read. Either way I didn't care. At the end of other people's meal I notice they just crumpled up the paper then throw it away. Seems wasteful or maybe cut on water costs for washing table cloths. Tacky for a two dollar sign steakhouse. Does anyone else do this at their restaurant?The closest I've seen to drawing on tables is The Spaghetti Factory by child customers."
none,"Hi all, I had a traumatic experience over a year ago. I was a young man (post college) trapped in between the stages of adolescence and true manhood/adulthood. My friends from college wanted to relive the fun ""college days."" It quickly turned into using drugs and alcohol to avoid facing any uncomfortable feelings within. It came to a point where I asked:Why are we doing this? What is there to celebrate? We aren't even leaving the apartment to meet women at the bars anymore. Just getting smashed. Taking Snapchats of others passed out on the toilet seat (which really make us all look bad by association). One night was particularly bad. We had this guy (call him Jeff) in our group. I noticed he always got us to get smashed, but he never got as drunk as us. He would Snapchat my best friend on the toilet seat passed out saying ""this is what happens when you party with me!"" to his 1k followers. A dominance tactic by an insecure fellow I figured.I remember we actually did go out. We came back to the apt. Started drinking more Tequila. Next thing I know I am without pants with a towel covering myself feeling wet. I literally got piss drunk. Pissed so much my phone stopped working (okay I laugh about this part now). Real talk:How did my pants get off?  Who took them off?  Did they take pictures?   Was my dick touched while I was unconscious? I was embarrassed. Woke up wet as water. Everyone was still asleep. 6 a.m. I find my wet pants on the dryer. I put them on and walk down all 32 floors of the apartment still drunk. Go home. Shower. The emotional abuse that ensued later was unacceptable:I discovered that the guy (Jeff) took off my pants b/c I was peeing on him on the couch. He did seemed pissed that I peed on him. I reminded him he was the one that pushed me and the other toilet friend to drink more. He got quiet. Another event - I walk in the door of a pregame. I am greeted. He tries to be subtle ""we got some big dick n\*ggas and some little dick n\*iggas!"" Then he looks at me. I give no reaction. He says ""Are you mad?"" I say nothing and walk on. In my head I was like, ""Dude I am about to quit a job I hate, having a rough time in my life, and it was obviously cold. Why are you doing this?"" I avoided a confrontation. I didn't have the energy. I was depressed at the time. The decision I had to make was heavy on my head. I didn't know if he had pics as blackmail. I thought this guy was a friend. He was too sucked into this ""being a bro, living the old days, not wanting to grow up"" kinda phase. Think fraternity bro bro. Another guy calls me a dog in the side of his mouth after a rave in a hotel bathroom. I said I was thirsty and he said ""Why don't you drink out of the toilet bowl."" I was shocked. Then someone quickly arrived in the room to tell us to go. The abuse hits other people in the group and then a high school friend spreads it to other old high school friends. Now everyone thinks my dick is small when in reality I was unconscious, flaccid and pissed myself. People look at your differently. Treat you differently. Less respect. More apprehension. Not happy to see you or now neutral. Seeing how these rumors were destroying my reputation in real time was excruciating. I eventually left everything behind. I summoned the courage to quit a corporate job I hated. Deleted all social media (except Reddit). I haven't contacted anyone from the past except one friend and family. Left my home on a near (12) month journey across the USA and Canada. I am in my 48th state. Afterwards, I plan to find a new place to live. My reasons to leave were much deeper than this. But it certainly is a reason not to come back. \------------------The [definition of sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault) is  an act in which a person intentionally sexually touches another person without that person's [consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent), or [coerces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion) or physically forces a person to engage in a [sexual act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_act) against their will. Not sure if I was sexually touched like I said. There was definitely emotional abuse and rumors afterwards. Questions for you all:1. Is this sexual abuse/assault?2. How do I heal from this?"
none,"Hi all, Day 77 of no PMO here. Longest streak was 100 days. Looking to beat it. Two days ago my flatline ended. I became a horny Henry. I downloaded Tinder for the first time in (6) months. I also got massive urges to look at the Instagrams of women I had sex with previously. I almost looked at porn, but have been able to dodge it.What I am dealing with now are back of the neck tensions and kidney tensions. Can anyone relate?I know tension is a common [withdrawal symptom](https://www.mywealthshop.com/withdrawal-symptoms-of-nofap-things-to-expect/). This could be detoxing toxins in my neck and kidneys. I am also looking for an explanation. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is where I look:The kidneys/bladder are the sexual organs in TCM. The Kidneys are the root of willpower and govern the bone, teeth, head hair, etc. Semen is yang energy that directly feeds the kidneys. Retention nourishes the body. I have had no nocturnal emissions. That tells me my body hasn't had to release an excessive of semen at night (Wet Dream). My body must still be healing/detoxing.I am curious about the connection between the lower back/kidneys and the back of the neck tensions. What could the tensions mean biologically, emotionally and perhaps even spiritually? Like all things - this will arise and pass away. I always want to know what's going on with my body though."
none,"Hi all, Got a surprise email today - 46 days into a year long lease my tenants want to break the lease. To add insult to injury, they mentioned they already signed a new lease (HELLO could've consulted me beforehand - major disrespect). They have no legally justifiable reasons to break the lease (WA state here). Regardless, I have to find a new tenant (they pay time for lost rent along with advertising costs by law but I can't lob punitive fees at them not that I would). **Context** \- they did mention in Jan 2019 that their son from another marriage may have to move in with them. Problems living w/ dad caused problems in school/health. I offered them an olive branch - a month-to-month lease in May until August 2019 w/ a sign a new year or leave. They decided to resign June 2019 to June 2020. **Hard Mode** \- I am out of the state on a multi-month journey. I do not want to fly back. I have no one that can help me. I have to hire out the finding of a new tenant WITHOUT committing to a year long property management (Christ they are like the Church - want 10% of your rent per month - tithe much?). **Sticking Points:**The only help I need is someone to physically inspect the unit, send me pictures, and be in the unit for open house on the weekends. I can do the tenant screening (credit/background checks), docusign them a lease, and collect rent via PayPal myself. Hell, I can even email directions to the unit and give utility/unit info prior to their arrival. Just need someone to open the door. **Win-Win?** I'm willing to work with them. The win-win is if they can show the unit Saturday/Sunday 1-4 p.m. until we find a new tenant. Currently asking clarifying questions of if they have already left.**Regardless:**It's a one bed one bath in the Seattle area that is priced below market. I'll take a hit, but get through it. **My Questions for you all**:1. Anyone been though this before and manage it remotely?2. Are my only options property management or a lone real estate agent (they need to have a license so I can go after them if things go South)?    1. So far property management companies have offered:      1. No we don't flip the unit for you. You need to commit to a full year of property management and they have to pay rent through our portal so we can take our cut first and then pay you (you seriously think I'll agree to that? - maybe if it was a commercial property).       2. 1st month's rent to flip the unit and then hand it back with a new tenant.       3. Half of first month's rent then you MUST sign us on for a year where we take 10% of your rent a month.       4. 1st months full rent to get the tenant then 10% of your rent every month for the next year. My first month's rent is $1,100. I can pay someone $50 an hour for 22 hours. I don't understand why there isn't a service just to show the house for rent and inspect the unit. I guess that's what you call friends....haha."
none,"Situation - I was in Acadia National Park in Maine (yes I do have an annual park pass). I was hoping to avoid paying $25 for a camp zone and found a off the path parking lot. Midnight I hear it. Knock knock. I am disoriented. I ask them to identify themselves. Police.I get out. Officer says I can't camp here. He then asks for my ID. I reach for my passport. Then he asks for my drivers license. Give that to him after his coworker shows up. Then I'm free to go no fine. It took about 20 minutes of foraging to my annoyance. Kept my cool.But this was the first time I got the knock and had to identify myself. I think I made the right move to be polite and comply but wonder if I could've just said the below. Maybe I would've gotten a fine for annoying the officer. As per the link below, an officer needs suspicion of criminal activity to ask me to identify myself. I could've said am I being detained or am I free to go?” But in a minor retaliation I could've gotten a fine. https://www.google.com/amp/s/reason.com/2012/04/05/7-rules-for-recording-police/%3fampAnyone have experience with this?"
none,"Hi all, I recently [posted this situation (with pictures)](https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurant/comments/c7ro8e/someone_sites_at_your_table_uninvited_power_move/) regarding two old white men sitting at my table without asking permission (initially) and ignoring me the whole time while waiting for their table. This occurred in Lexington, Kentucky. The consensus is that sitting at someone's table without asking is universally rude. It's not like this is a Costco Food court. The motivating factors could be a mix of conscious or unconscious racism/bias/prejudice, old men being old men, small town mentality, lack of basic social graces, white privileged entitlement, etc. My question to you all:What would you have done in this situation?"
none,"This is an odd situation that has never happened to me before (except in less formal settings like Costco or Starbucks where it's no big deal and people have always asked). I'm probably overthinking it on the analysis, but also want opinions on how you would've handled it. A part of me wants to say some level of racism (unconscious or conscious) which is a power move in itself (thinking you are superior to another race). Another part wants to think it was either a cultural quick or old people being old. I am a man of mixed race born/raised in Seattle. I spent (6) months in the Deep South ending three months ago. I have experienced more racial discrimination that I thought. That colors my perception of this situation. This is my second venture into it. I would argue Kentucky is very Southern, but was historically a border state in the Civil War and has a sizable amount of Democrats. It's an odd middle child. Situation:I was at this fantastic restaurant in Lexington, Kentucky around 1 p.m. by myself on a three top table (smallest they had). As I finished I sat there digesting the food and waiting for the check. I soon realized you pay at the front, but still needed to digest. I noticed the restaurant started to fill up after I finished my fantastic meal. And then... Problem:Two older white men were waiting in line. The first older white man (70's) straight colonizes the seat across from me without saying a word. I am perplexed. Is this guy colonizing my space? I am from Seattle and am not sure if this is a cultural quirk or unconscious racist power move. I calmly observe him:1. He made no eye contact with me nor engaged me in any way.2. He looks weary. I figured maybe he is just an old man that needed to sit down (then I noticed there were free waiting area seats).    1. I then reason that perhaps he needs to rest his elbow somewhere and there is something medically wrong with him. 3. Wondering if this was a Kentucky thing or if he is just an entitled white man. After two minutes the younger old white man (50's) approaches:1. He does ask if it is okay if he sits there.    1. Not wanting to appear rude I do agree. Not sure how to handle that one.2. See 3rd picture below - he positions his chair away from mine. Their conversation:1. Again there is no engagement what so ever besides that second man being polite. 2. The rude older man is asking the younger man about his time in Germany recently. 3. I gather from the convo:   1. The older man has not been out of the country. That explains his lack of social graces/awareness.    2. The younger old man was relatively new to travel himself. I got up to pay. The younger older man said, ""Thank you for sharing."" I said, ""Sure."" In the back of my head I couldn't help, but think about our Native American brothers and sisters. They were never thanked for ""sharing"" their land. And that's it folks. Again a new situation for me. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but curious to see how you all would've handled it and how you perceive the situation. Pictures of the situation: [https://imgur.com/a/s11Q0mP](https://imgur.com/a/s11Q0mP) 1st Picture - Taken off Yelp - the (3) person table on the very left where the young white man is sitting looking at his phone is my table. I sat opposite to him. 2nd Picture below the 1st - taken off Yelp - where that white fellow's elbow is on the right of the picture is where I'm sitting. Notice on the left there are seats for waiting. 3rd Picture - taken in real time while the men were sitting at my table - notice the three waiting seats were wide open. The white guy on the left position his chair away from me to talk to the other gentleman."
none,"Hi all, Here in Canada of all places. It's always the first night I get into a deep convo with the host or hostess. Basically, she told me all her beliefs, didn't want to listen to my respectful counterpoints and her beliefs scare the crap out of me. I've AirBnB'ed to (30) different states now in the USA. I have never encountered someone like this. Assholes for sure, but not someone like this. Anyway to get out of this kind of situation in the future?Her beliefs (She is a white European whose parents migrated to Canada in the 70's and I am a mixed race man):1. All immigration to Canada is bad.    1. It takes opportunities away from Canadians.    2. Other cultures aren't meant to inter-mix. 2. All social programs are bad.   1. They make people's minds dull.   2. People should pull themselves up from their bootstraps. 3. Both world wars were started by the Jewish elite (I guess she avoids Anti-Semetism by telling me only the elite Jews are the problem not everyone else) to create Israel.   1. The elite Jews started the Holocaust to get Jews out of Europe and create a victim mindset so the world doesn't see through them. 4. Catholicism is the superior religion. 5. Other cultures aren't meant to mix. She claims scientists have proven homogeneous cultures work better (WTF even plants thrive with diversity). 6. Trump supporter (no problem people have their opinions) until he moved the embassy to Israel. He is in the back pocket of the Jews she claims owns every global system. 7. Iran and North Korea are the only countries fighting global Jewish control. 8. Jews want to control the world. 9. Technology is bad.    1. Makes people's minds dull.   2. Government is watching. 10. Immigrants are destroying Canada. 11. Jews are giving us a slow death with chem trails and water pollution. 12. The Jewish Messiah will be the Christian anti-Christ. 13. She believes White European culture is superior and all of man's advances came from Europe. 14. Her daughter is in her 20's homeless across the country and is a drug addict. 15. She divorced from her husband a while back. 16. She speaks several languages so she isn't stupid. 17. Etc. Yeah....a lot to take in. I only hear about these folks online. I am on a road trip trying to understand more about the world. So I listened. I didn't lose my cool since I have until tomorrow to stay with her. I did assert some points, but she has no ears. It's odd because she doesn't hate me. She just holds these insane views from her ""Truthers"" on YouTube. I know a conspiracy theory or two. I mentioned Reptilians and putting in human embryos in the food supply to keep humans aggressive to test her out. Somehow I got too wild for her. Glad she has a limit. But damn is this line of thinking terrifying. What's odd is that we get along. Even after this conversation. It isn't jovial, but it's not like I sense hate towards me. Just a woman in her fifties with extreme views. In the event this happens again - what recourse do I have to leave?She is basically a racist, xenophobic, hyper religious, anti-Semetic Canadian nationalist."
none,"Does anyone else get the below from other people who presumably hate technological progress?How do you respond when the other party is not receptive to facts at all? Examples:A. Bangor, ME, USA - I AirBnBed with a former US marine. He started to pick a fight over the fact that I own a Tesla. He tried to tell me he never sees any charging stations. He is a huge cross country driver (despite working in the Aviation Industry). He asked how long it takes to charge. I said on 2% left it took me an hour to get back to 95% charge. He started to insult the car saying on the I-10 it takes 10 hours at 100 miles an hour to drive. That would add (2)-(3) hours to his trip. I told him Elon is working on charging speeds so they are faster. Also, more and more Super Chargers will be built. He didn't seem keen on listening. The more I kept contradicting him with facts - the angrier he got. I was able to make it on a 310 M3 AWD from Bangor to Campobello Island in Canada and back with 7% battery left. The next day I was able to go from Bangor to Mt. Katahdin and the Ice Caves with only 2% battery left (That was bad because I was going 59 mph in a 75 mph zone, but everyone was cool with it). Figured I could use the Baxter State park charger. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLzLfvBD2To) had a model X. I arrived and my Model 3 was not compatible with the [Level 2 charger there](https://www.consumerreports.org/hybrids-evs/whats-the-right-electric-car-charger-for-your-home/). Guess Model X's have a multi-pronged charge port. Each time I told him about my close calls. His views started to change. B. Quebec City and Montreal in general - lots of people (Montreal Esp) have BMW's, Mercedes and the like. When I roll up with the Tesla I get mugged super hard. People also make it a point to stare at my WA state plates. I waive to them and they never return the waive. This has happened over 15 times now. One local said it was because they aren't use to seeing WA plates. Some people also try to race me more in Canada than all the states from Virginia to Maine that I've driven through. Odd. C. Montreal, Canada - I roll up to pay for parking at St. Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal. The attendant sarcastically asks in his French accent, ""How many charges did it take you to get from WA state?"" I don't interpret sarcasm well so I went into geek mode and started explaining the car's range. He then said ""Two or three charges"" and smiled smugly. I didn't understand until I remembered that many of my fellow Catholics are lean conservative. Montreal is a majority Catholic/Christian city. I dislike having to equate ignorance to my religion, but that is what I've been experiencing. Sh\*ts on a Tesla and then texts on his smartphone... D. Bragg Farm Sugar House & Gift Shop - Montpelier, VT - an older man (60's) from Baltimore asks if I am driving the Tesla out there. I say, ""Yes sir"" and he chuckles at me for addressing him with respect. Then he goes on to talk about how he was the first thousand on the wait list. He gave up and got all defeatist on me. ""What does an old guy like me need a $50k car for anyways."" I told him about my rough customer service experience at Tesla to make him feel better. It didn't seem to work. He was too preoccupied with the poor marketing of the battery. Ultimately, I smelled regret which turns into resentment towards Tesla. He said he bitterly ended it by saying he was happy for me. Seemed like he just wanted someone to listen to him complain. I understand why this man dislikes Tesla. The first two just seemed to fear the unknown and dislike change. I know I shouldn't give a damn. I am from the West Coast where I don't encounter people like this. Most of my friends are pretty progressive and technological millennials. So dealing with tech averse folks is a first for me."
none,"Hi all, Rolling into the province of Quebec for the first time every (from Seattle so I've hit up Vancouver, BC a lot). The plan:A. 2 days camping in Quebec City   B. 1 day camping between Quebec City and Montreal (probably at Parc National de la Mauricie - downside is that I may have to pay to camp). C. 2 day camping in MontrealD. 10 day meditation retreat outside MonrealE. Back to Montreal and Toronto for an unspecified amount of time before I return to the USA by way of Niagara Falls. I've car camped from Virginia to Maine thus far. Got ""the knock"" a few times already. Never any tickets or arrests of course. Any advice for the CAN? My idea is to avoid paying for any campsites if possible. I've never car camped (or camped in general) in a foreign country before. I have definitely been abroad before though. Never by myself though."
none,"Hi all, My question is - how do you all discern between a racist, an asshole, and/or a tough person? Racism is so interwoven in American society. But now I am starting to see that sometimes racism is not part of the equation at all in some interactions. It is just ignorance (which is the root of all racism in my opinion). I was born/raised in Seattle. The racism there is like vanilla - [seems like a plain flavor. But it's actually the most complex and subtle flavor](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1wu1sh/til_that_despite_being_synonymous_with_blandness/). I have been on a road trip by myself for (9) months and have hit 30 states now. When I went into the Deep South I experienced direct racism in a way I have never had it before. And I have traveled the world (never by myself). Florida and Texas are different from the rest of the South. Florida seems to have a lot of mean spirited people (especially old native Floridians). People are unnecessarily competitive. I've actually encountered a few who are just mean people and had no racist intent or language behind their negativity. I found this fascinating. When I got to NYC, Boston, and New England I started to see people who were tough. Not necessarily nice and welcoming. Rough around the edges. Sometimes blunt and direct. But not mean or racist. Intriguing. When I got to Vermont and Maine I could clearly see I was encroaching upon ""white space."" The subtle Seattle racism reappeared. The difference is that these people have almost no exposure to people of color unlike Seattle (13% Asian but 68% white city - Maine is 95% white and Vermont is 96%). People are liberal with their politics but conservative with their behavior/mannerisms. It's an odd combo. But again I don't get the kind of hate I got from the South. Not knowing how to act - sure. Discomfort sure. What you would call unconscious racism - yes. I could write a novel. I'll stop here."
none,"Hi all, I've been car camping across the East coast for the first time. I've had some run-ins with the police at Acadia National Park in Maine for example. I parked in a park parking lot at 9 p.m. I was woken up at 11:30 p.m. by an officer telling me to leave, asking for my ID and then letting me be on my way. I've never had a criminal record so I'm not worried.It's perfectly in their right to ask me to leave. He could clearly see me sleeping through my windows. And I knew I wasn't supposed to be in that park. My questions for the future are:1. If my car had been completely blacked out and I did not answer the officer (they cannot confirm someone is in the car), can they ticket my car?   1. If it wasn't in a National Park and it was blacked out (parked in a suburb or city street for a night), could they ticket me? I understand each state/county/city is different. Curious what yours is like.2. Do the police have the unquestionable authority/right to ask me for my driver's license when asking me not to car camp in a spot for a night?    1. Do I have a right to refuse and leave or am I risking a ticket by being ""difficult?"" Mind you I am driving a brand new 2019 Tesla  Model 3. I'm no eyesore to a typical neighborhood and never stay longer than a night in one place (unless I'm truly allowed to like Walmart or a casino). I am also well dressed so not homeless."
none,"Hi all - I recently stayed at an AirBnB with a $100 cleaning fee. Private room. Shared kitchen and bathroom. (8) day stay. No other guests just the host family. I always strip the bed, leave everything clean, etc. I honestly do this for my now 35 stellar reviews. I cleaned all my dishes except one pot I left soaking in the sink. I let the host know and still got the great review. But I also think for $100 cleaning fee I basically did their job for them.In the hosts' opinions - what's the balance? What mess can I reasonably leave as a guest in the USA?1. Stripping the bed - from what I can tell only a portion of AirBnB listing demand this. It's certainly a best practice as a guest, but do all of you hosts expect it? I get this isn't a hotel/motel, but you all do charge a cleaning fee. 2. Doing dishes - I don't see this in many house rules. Some hosts say to leave it in the dishwasher and they'll take care of it. Most don't mention it. Again - for a $100 cleaning fee - am I entitled to leave my dishes in the sink for the host to clean?3. Taking out the trash - I've only had one BnB ask me to do this before leaving in Daytona Beach, FL. This did offend me, but I did do it anyways and got a great review. I normally don't take out the trash and leave any recycling next to the trash can (boxes cut/folded). Thoughts? 4. Hair in the sink from shaving - I always wipe down the sink after shaving. I think that's expected but I'm sure you all have had guests that do otherwise. 5. What is the cleaning fee for really? I get in a perfect world you have guests like me where you only put the sheets in the washer/dryer and back on the bed. I don't think it's entirely fair for me to pay for your turnover. Again - it's not a hotel/motel, but what's the balance?I'm trying to find the breaking point where I leave a reasonable mess and the host still leaves a good review."
none,"Hi all,I am reviewing these car seats I bought via [CariD](https://www.carid.com/rixxu/rixxu-super-sport-series-seat-covers-883608833.html). (For some reason their [official website](http://rixxu.com/) is lacking in content).**Price**: $93.95**Shipping**: Free and Fast (got my product in two days on the East Coast, USA).**Pro Tip**: CariD is an mad decent company. They give out a lot of $25 gift cards. I bought from them previously, reviewed their product and was given a $25 off for this order (or I could've used it on the previous order according to the customer service person FYI).**Customer Service**: Superior. I love how CariD has someone online when I need them. No need to call, just IM. They gave me specific details on how fast it would get to me based on my zip code (I am travelling relying on AirBnB's to get my products. This helps with planning).**Packaging**: Classy. I like how its in a sort of duffel bag (see final image in the imgur link below).**Installation**: No instructions provided. Online the best video you will find is here.[Here is the closest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzXzqsZXNiY) that is product specific (Rixxu brand).Problem - they don't show you how to install for the backseat row. Also, the M3 backseat headrests do not move up/down like the middle seat headrest. I improvised by placing those two on the front seats.[Here is the best video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOKwKb9hVWg) to show you how to attach it to the backseat via removing the entire back seat (not product or car specific).[Here is the best car specific video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNQla0zTg1Q) on how to remove the backseat on your M3 (I personally only removed both latches. I did not need to remove my heat sensors for this install).I already knew how to remove the entire backseat so this took me (30) minutes. There were some confusing moments though. I did my best. My conclusion is that the backseat row isn't as custom as they'd like you to think. It's not a perfect fit.**Thoughts:**The actual red part is a solid fabric. The product does not feel cheap. Full coverage.Problems in the backseat are:1. The provided headrest covers do not work on (2) of the (3) headrests.2. The top part and sides fit well. The bottom part is what doesn't fully cover the seat so it looks crooked/doesn't fully line up with the top part.3. Seat belt buckles don't come through the product. There are no holes for them built into the product.4. That middle pullout on the backseat cannot come out unless you unzip the middle fabric (see pictures).**Conclusion:**For the $68+ I paid - they are solid. Fantastic aesthetic. Fully covers the seat. However, there is much to be desired in terms of backseat coverage, back seat headrest coverage, fixing the crookedness, and detailed installation instructions (specific to Tesla M3 would be awesome). I'm curious if there is  a better option out there.Their front seat products ship on May 27 (15 days from now). It's a popular item. Long lead time. Same with their steering wheel cover. I'll probably end up buying both to make sure everything matches.**Question:****What do you all use?**[https://imgur.com/gallery/firaDDx](https://imgur.com/gallery/firaDDx)**5/14/19 Update - Second Attempt - Better**Hi y'all - so I changed the way I linked up the belts underneath the seat as you can see below. It is much more level and less crooked. I did have a grip about the far left/right corner near the door being loose. The center part was a judgement call. If I had placed it all the way up - it would've covered the seat belt covers. If I placed it like I did, then you see the mesh straps. I settled for this out of functionality. Buy?Again - I think it's solid. I hope this post helps other people install. I still would buy it w/o the $25 gift card. The other option is the [$449.95 Evannex Model 3 Custom Seat Covers](https://evannex.com/products/seat-covers-for-tesla-model-3). Not as sexy, but it fits perfectly I'm sure. It's also $449.95 compared to Rixxu's ($123 (front seat covers) + back seat w/o gift card ($93.95)) $216.95. Both have free and fast shipping. For more than half off and the aesthetic (assuming you don't have animals) - I'd go with Rixxu any day.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/WDGriiV](https://imgur.com/gallery/WDGriiV)"
none,"Whenever I make a good point about my parents emotional neglect or narcissistic abuse it always morphs into well we aren't perfect.” No only does that avoid addressing the specific grievances, it is a cheap attempt at excusing their nbehavior. It's like pleading the fifth in court when you get backed into a corner. How do you all counter this?On another note:It's Mother's Day tomorrow. I was going to send my mom a quick email.

Climate control set to 65F via the app.3. Overnight low temp was 45F.4. Woke up and battery reduced to 174 miles.5. Saw a notification on my phone stating Climate controls shut off after four hours.”Does anyone know how to extend this time to a full (8) hours on a Model 3?"
none,"Hi all, I wrote a post about my frustration with halfhearted general apologies from my Nparents. I also listed out the 40+ ways I've been abused. r/bobbywright86 stated that ""Keeping the phone line open gives a path for the toxicity to seep back into your life. You can never get clean if you keep taking the drug.""***It got me thinking - under what conditions do you go full no contact with your Nparents?It's a truly extreme move. And I've made some bold fucking moves in the last (9) months:1. Quit my corporate job last summer. 2. Permanently deleted all social media (keeping phone/email the same). Except Reddit. 3. Left my home to travel all (50) states for a new purpose/place to live. Been doing it for almost (9) months now.4. I have not communicated with anyone from my past life in (9) months other than mom, dad, sister and one friend from childhood ^(long story, but realized a lot of friends were fake. I was the giver in a bunch of co-dependent relationships b/c my Nmom programmed me to parent her from a young age. Thus attracting a lot of takers, narcs, and abusers). 5. I email my parents, but don't let them know where I'm at. I go a week to a month without emailing. 6. Bought a new car on the road. 7. Renounced all alcohol and other intoxicants last September. 8. Stepped down from a coveted volunteer position before I left on this journey. 9. Cancelled my real estate license. But shit man. Blocking them completely from all emails and texts. Not talking to them for a year or so or never. That is a heavy thought.....Reasons for No Contact that I have read on the Reddit:1. Narc abuse fosters addictions in you. We are use to putting ourselves second and looking to the new abuser to see to their needs/emotional/physical well being. Addiction comes w/ very real withdrawal. ^Never thought of narc abuse as a hit from a drug. Is that true? Seems extreme. 2. No Contact to reprogram brain and remove conditioned responses. There is a trauma bond that needs to be broken. I agree with this. Why I can't completely go full no contact?1. Don't have a new job yet - I rely on my rental home for income which is still in my parents' name. I manage it all remotely (big learning experience). They could take it away at any time. They don't b/c they know I would then be fully justified to going No Contact. 2. My cell phone is under their plan. I believe I can take my number with me when I'm ready to make the move. However, just bought a new I-phone on a 30 month payment plan. Not sure if I can transfer that at the same rate. 3. I don't have a physical address yet. My mail all goes back home. 4. My insurance agent is a tenant in my dad's commercial building. I can easily break away from him. 5. It's a tough move to make. I kept a phone and email line open to see which friends would hit me up. I was a real popular guy. No one. I realize passivity isn't a good test to see who cares, but also see I built too much breadth instead of depth w/ my relationships. My Nparents made me scared to get close to people. However, if I change my cell and email, ""old friends"" can say I am a heartless bastard that gave them no way to contact me. 6. I have two sisters that would never talk to me again. One thinks I AM THE NARC....All in all though, not many strings left to go No Contact. I did all the heavy cord cutting these last (9) months. Just need to understand what pushed other people to make the move, stick with it, and the effects (how long does it take to recover from Nabuse?). What moves me closer to this No Contact conclusion?My sister is a learned narcissist. A therapist helped me come to this conclusion. Seeing her at month (8) of my journey in person would be a good barometer at how far I've come at:1. Setting boundaries.2. Enforcing boundaries.3. Non-violent communication.4. Standing my ground and refusing to be gaslit or forced to apologize. I passed the test. At first I didn't want to believe she was a narc. However, everything she presented was that of a narcissist. I had cognitive dissonance. My therapist helped me see the truth. She does have a good heart. She wasn't an empath. But she has been programmed and abused (not as much as me) to be a narc to fit in.On a scale from empath to full narc she is 1/3rd of the way to narc.My parents are 2/3rds on the way to narc. What got me was when she said my parents never did anything wrong. They have nothing to apologize for. I have everything to apologize for. And she hinted I was the narc and gaslighted me. It made me realize that I can't change someone who doesn't want help. Maybe No Contact is the way to go after all..."
none,"It seems many of you have nparents that never apologize. Just like my nFather. He has never apologized for anything except for not teaching me how to date women and feeling guilty for spreading rumors that I was gay. And he had to. I cornered him in a therapy session - one of the rare three I got them to come up. However, my nMom is cunning. This is what she wrote to me on my birthday two months after I left with no contact:For your birthday, I can only give you my apologies for all our misunderstandings, my shortcomings, and faults. I am truly sorry.She has done this in the past at critical moments. She plays the victim. Breaks down/cries. Says a general sorry. Asks for a forgive and forget. Back to normal. Nothing changes. Does anyone else have this problem? If there ever is an apology, it is not specific or satisfying at all. An apology has a few critical elements:* **Expression** of regret                          -  she did that in a general way. * Explanation of what went wrong     - nothing **specific**. * Acknowledgment of responsibility  - nothing **specific**. * Declaration of repentance                 - there is definitely no promise to heal or fix herself. * **Offer** of repair                                     - no repair. She uses material gifts to manipulate me. * Request for forgiveness                     - notice there is no ""please forgive me."" She never specifically apologized for:1. Setting me up for a lifetime of abuse - abusive friends/lovers. 2. Never understanding where I came from/my traumas. 3. Never apologizing for threatening to divorce my dad and crying to me from ages 5-11 years old. 4. Shaming the shit out of me from wetting my bed from 3 to 12 years old.   1. Sleep was the only time I felt I could relax. All others times I was on edge at the shitty environment she created. 5. Calling me gay from 12 to 25 years of age and then telling other people from 23-25 years old. Getting them to gang up on me. 6. Accusing me of throwing up my food if I get too skinny and calling me grotesque when I gain muscle and get healthy. 7. Refusing to feed me healthy food because she dislikes an organic/granola Aunt of mine (we had the money).8. Actively putting down my attempts at juicing at 24-25 years old to heal myself. 9. Withdrawing love/affection and even home cooking when she didn't get what she want. 10. Forcing me to apologize when I didn't want to nor had to. 11. Claiming I am not ""Asian enough"" and not helping me form a solid multiracial identity. 12. Talking about intimate problems/woes with my father when I was just a kid. 13. Manipulating me to go to a college she wanted me to go to b/c she couldn't let go. 14. Refusing to listen to me and my problems. 15. Never celebrating my accomplishments. 16. Never coming to any sporting events from middle to high school to college. 17. Lying to me whenever it was convenient. 18. Constantly gaslighting my negative past experiences with her. 19. Manipulating my baby sister to make her think I was dumb and couldn't help with her homework. 20. Constantly invading my privacy, listening in on my phone calls and rummaging through my room instead of having the courage to have an intimate conversation/ask me about myself. 21. Talking poorly behind my back to others. 22. Giving me strings attached presents and clothes. When I want to later donate them she angrily exclaims ""They aren't yours they are mine I bought them for you!"" 23. Created an unsafe environment by telling me that we would lose everything from ages 6 to 14 years old, crying on the toilet seat and making me listen to her problems (parentifying your child). 24. Never teaching me or respecting my boundaries. 25. Laugh at me when I got into a bar fight instead of showing concerns for my wounds. 26. Making me seek co-dependent relationships as a giver and being too afraid to receive love. 27. Making me distrust women b/c of all her lies and deceptions. 28. Teaching me that subterfuge and Machiavellian politics instead of ruthless authenticity is how you be successful. 29. Treating me like an accessory to her instead of a person. 30. Teaching me to suppress my emotions (anger, grief and shame particularly). 31. Never allowing me to go to a therapist because it would make her look bad. 32. Keeping me from individuating. 33. Putting me down for learning how to cook at 17 (a sign of independence which she hated). 34. Always criticizing and judging me instead of loving/accepting me for who I am. 35. Teaching me to seek external validation instead of internal validation. 36. Making me a complete doormat and punishing me for standing up for myself. 37. Whenever I am proud of myself she would call ME a narcissist. 38. Causing me to derive my self worth only from my achievements. 39. Never letting me have my own wants, needs, and goals. 40. Always putting down my intuition and telling me not to trust it in indirect ways like gaslighting. 41. Teaching me to always forgive and forget and therefore be a doormat. 42. Etc."
none,"Hi all, TL;DR - What techniques, books or other resources have you used to deprogram old triggers and learn to stand up for yourself? I have been No Contact (limited contact over email only and I don't give away my location) with my nparents for (8) months now. I have a [controlling mother/passive father family dynamic](https://confidentman.net/masculinity/disastrous-duo-controlling-mother-passive-father). It has been extremely detrimental to my masculinity/standing up for myself. My father never stood up for me. He was a narcissist too. Achievements:1. It is now easy for me to say ""No"" to others and my parents. 2. I am getting better at setting boundaries. T[his list of universal human rights](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201406/how-spot-and-stop-manipulators) has really helped me set my boundaries. 3. I stood my ground with my learned narcissist sister (she has a good heart, but learned to be a narcissist to fit in with the family - lots of programming she will have to defuse to get back to herself) at a lunch two weeks ago. Big milestone for me.    1. She truly tried to push every button. She also made the crazy assertion that my parents never did anything wrong. She demanded I apologize (power move) when I did everything right prior to leaving on this journey. 4. I have gone ""Grey Rock"" and/or full ignore on people who disrespect me. The days of allowed disrespect have decreased from 9 days to 1-2 days. In the below situation, it took me a few days because this lady used flattery/supposed psychic insight to deceive me.    1. For example, in my AirBnB I had a co-living situation. A nightmare roommate who claimed I had massive negativity and needed to move out to deal with it. Her ulterior motive was to get people out of the unit. I was under a lot of grief at the time. I started to believe her until I saw how selfish she was. It was all about her. A small speck on the microwave or grease on the stove? She would freak out. If you were playing music before quiet hours, she would freak out. (I am not proud of this) but I took a bath in one of the two bathrooms at 10 p.m. She comes home at 10:25 p.m. banging on my door. I didn't hear her because my head was underwater. I get a call from my property manager telling me it is quiet hours after 10 p.m. Stop playing music. I was playing smooth jazz on low...Okay. I turn it off. Banging continues, ""My stuff is in that bathroom I need to take a shower."" I respond, ""Okay give me five minutes."" Anger and banging continues. She is my elder (around 50). I have a difficult time disrespecting or standing up to elders especially women. I slowly get up, look around, and see that there is nothing in this bathroom. Not even a towel. I get out and somewhat angrily ask if she called the property manager on me. She lies. She says no straight to my face. (I later find out that she did lie. The PM said no one else in the unit other than her complained about me). No thank you. Then she continues to complain to me about some random spots on the counter. Talking to me like a child. I kept summarizing her complaints diplomatically and asking if there is anything else. She kept going. She was a negativity machine.  I now see that I need to be like Teflon. She is trying to build a case against me. I have to do every single thing by the book. This goes on to the next day when I am eating and playing some smooth jazz on a Sunday at 3 p.m. She tells me to turn off my music because I am disturbing others. No one was there. Out of respect I turn it down, but not off. She then continues to harass me. I keep telling her to stop. I am eating and do not want to be disturbed. She continues. She says she knows I won't move out after our bathtub altercation. She says she will be here for a year and isn't going anywhere (an obvious effort to intimidate me). At this point I go full grey rock/ignore her. The property manager openly tells me he hates her. This issue has been boiling since before I arrived. A few days he gives her an ultimatum. She finally leaves to an apartment down the hall. He even tells me she complained about me ignoring her. He said that was crazy. It was his advice to me to completely ignore her.       1. Where did I fail?      2. I should not have gotten out of that bathtub. Turning off the music, sure. But there was a whole other bathroom. I should've told her to use that one.       3. I should have called her out immediately after she talked to me like a kid after she came out of the bath. IF she did not apologize, go full ignore the rest of her stay.       4. I should have not turned down my jazz at all that Sunday at 3 p.m. and completely ignored her complaining about every little thing.       5. Why did I fail?      6. She was a reincarnation of my nMom sent to test me. Seriously. An insecure controlling older woman who was set in her ways. Standing up for myself in general is tough, but with someone so close to being like my mother - it sets off so many PTSD triggers.       7. Where did I succeed?      8. Keeping my cool. Ignoring her instead of fighting back harder (which I did need to do). It gave her zero ground to paint me as the bad guy. It was non-violent and unexciting. It eventually led the PM to see she was the problem. Current Problems:1. I do have a long history of bulling (mainly from my nMom). And find it extremely hard to stand up for myself. 2. Taking a more assertive/aggressive stance past simply ignoring that person's existence to more aggressive/direct manipulators like the woman in that above example.    1. I need to break the cycle of passivity.   2. Basically, instead of retreating I need to push my energy outwards more. Resources I know of, but haven't looked into yet:Non-violent communication has been recommended to me.

none,"Yeah I said it. I've been on a road trip around the USA all by myself for over (8) months now. The scariest driving was on the I-10 from New Orleans to Florida especially in Alabama/Mississippi. The most aggressive was Miami then LA. They seem dangerous and unpredictable. Going to the store seems to be like a Forza race to them. Driving isn't football/baseball/basketball - it's not a win/lose situation. We can all collaborate to make sure we don't die. I bought a new car in DC. Lots of folks kept telling me that NYC will be a death trap. I've been here for (3) weeks now parking my car in Harlem on the streets daily. No problems. No scraps. No one breaking into my car. No bumps. Hell sometimes the police don't ticket me an hour into those 1 hr and 30 minute street cleaning times every M/W or Tues/Fri depending on the street sign. I haven't received a ticket yet. I've driven on the FDR highway (tight lanes so that was a bit scary) to Williamsburg. I've driven various parts of Manhattan - night and day. I've driven all over Harlem and the Bronx. I've driven up the Palisades on the New Jersey side into the town that houses Westpoint. No troubles. People here don't seem to get road rage. They honk, but it's impersonal. There is no intention of anger. They are so use to pushing through people on the busy subway/streets that it's understood that it's not an individual attack of sorts. They just need to get somewhere like you. An odd understanding that would trigger someone from a less crowded city. I kinda like it. Odd Quirks:1. Folks double parking on street cleaning times to then move their cars back to their spots.    1. I asked one New Yorker and he said we could all technically get ticketed, but it's NY. No parking - what can you do. 2. UPS, delivery trucks and private cars alike often stand on the right lane of a two lane road with a line of parked cars on the right.    1. Many times they do so without shame - no emergency blinkers or they are having a regular conversation while everyone is moving around them. And no one honks (unless that person stopped suddenly without warning). It's understood that - hey what can you do - there's no parking to stand.    2. And sometimes people stall in the other lane with is even worse. It's like a guessing game on which lane to switch to.    3. I see standing happen most in the Bronx and Harlem, but it happens everywhere. 3. When people stand and your having a tough time getting through them, others on the street may help you. I liked that camaraderie. But damn have I come close to scrapping some cars. Focus and confidence is necessary. 4. Some of their cars have skirts as I call them. More like bumper guards that hang from their trunk. I've never seen this anywhere in the USA. I've driven through over (20) states.    1. Also, it seems that cars that are the Nissan Rogue and below in price tend to have these guards. You don't see the Mercedes/Tesla with bumper guards. I think people universally respect power/wealth in NYC. What makes New York City drivers better than average:1. Shared understanding and acceptance that this is a busy/crowded place.2. They help each other out in parking/getting past standing cars. 3. They are not dangerous and are somewhat predictable, but still assertive. 4. They tend to weave through traffic and respond better than anyone I have seen. Creative driving for sure, but I never felt unsafe next to them.5. No road rage from what I have seen - everyone accepts it is busy, citywide 25 mph speed limit, it is a city of (8) million people, etc. If you're driving, your going slow. It is what it is. 6. People aren't afraid to use their horn.7. The use of the horn is part of the culture and isn't seen as an aggressive/unexpected/impolite action like it would be in the Pacific Northwest. In fact, it would be odd to go a day without hearing a horn honking.    1. The joke is that in the PacNW we honk our horn after the car crash has happened. 8. They are not overly polite.   1. In the Pacific Northwest you could get into a four way stop. The non-verbal conversation would be like - no you go, no I insist you go, okay I will go, nope I guess your going, oh I didn't mean to be rude you go. This can cause inefficiencies. 9. They don't speed on the highways - you have a few hot rods, but most folks respect the 50 mph speed limit on the I-87 for example.    1. On the Palisade Scenic Highway on the New Jersey side I did notice people going 65 in a 50 or even 70, but everyone was doing it. It also didn't feel unsafe like Miami. Just a shared understanding. No one going unusually slow or below the speed limit."
none,"Hi all, I've been looking into the subtitles of power/tactics used by the narcissist. Both my parents are narcissists. One tactic my mother used was to always demand I apologize - even when I did nothing wrong. Guilt and shame. They were the two swords she would cut me with until I would yield. Endless threats would ensue if the swords didn't cut. I'm starting to realize she did it to maintain dominance over me. The problem I grapple with is a people pleasing/passive mindset that has effected all of my relationships. I'm more inclined to retreat than stand up for myself. I have been taught that defusing the conflict with an apology is a better way to deal with an aggressor. My father has modeled this. However, it is incorrect in a fair amount of situations. You must stand up for yourself. And I only started to realize this when my sister started to do the same thing. She's a learned narcissist. Not as far on the scale as my mom. But she uses the same tactics. She proclaims my mom is her ""best friend."" Unhealthy. They have much less sting from her. I can see them more clearly in the moment. I also never give into this power play unless I truly feel I messed up. I don't use apologies as a way to relate/appease people ""I am sorry you feel that way."" I would even go so far as to say that if you don't truly feel sorry - saying it just to say it is inauthentic/fake. I was reflecting on this and came across the below article: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fighting-fear/201402/demanding-apology](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fighting-fear/201402/demanding-apology)   There are some people who demand an apology! I'm waiting for an apology,” a young woman texts her [friend](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/friends). A mother says to her son who forgot to pick her up from the train station: If you don't apologize, I'm not going to your graduation.” **What good is an apology if it does not reflect an actual feeling of regret? It is simply an exercise of power.** One person is dominant enough to make the other shoulder the responsibility for an argument or for something having gone wrong. When a child has grown past the point of knowing what an apology means, a parent should no longer demand an apology if the young person does not feel inclined to give it.But he or she *should not* apologize just to make peace.” It is a short-lasting armistice. An example: a man with a wife and children tries to cope with his wife's inclination to sulk following every argument by apologizing. It costs me nothing,” he says. But it does. She continues to make similar demands in the future. The length of time she can sulk grows longer and longer. **Apologies lose all meaning when they are divorced from the way the person really feels**. They are demeaning to the man or woman who apologizes and unconvincing to everyone else. They are not going to help this particular couple figure out how to get along better. **Resentment is the consequence of having to apologize unwillingly.**Basic Review - the Elements of an Apology:* Expression of regret* Explanation of what went wrong* Acknowledgment of responsibility* Declaration of repentance* Offer of repair* Request for forgivenessDo any of you agree and/or have any examples of nparents and/or manipulators demanding an apology when you didn't feel like you did anything wrong?How do you counter it? Is there a way to do it with tact or do you grab the bull by the horns and refuse to apologize? Honestly, they don't give up until you do apologize."
none,"Hi all,I recently bought a 2019 Model 3. My plan is to camp in it. Everything from the sleeping bag, mattress or padding, keeping the car at a good temp, finding camp sites, etc is handled. What I hate is the morning light and lack of privacy. Has anyone been able to solve for that?I was thinking a car cover, but I can't find any with doors that still let you get into your car.Tinting the windows is a possibility. But creepers can still peek into your car."
none,"Hi all,I have two narcissistic parents (mother is engulfing and father is abandoning/distancing). This creates a [passive father/controlling mother dynamic](https://confidentman.net/masculinity/disastrous-duo-controlling-mother-passive-father). That sort of marriage only works if the mom is the center of everything. When the husband finally stands up - she goes into a narcissistic rage. For example, my father was so afraid to take on the fatherly role of teacher. My mother literally had to push him to teach me how to drive at 16. As young as 3 year old, he always kept losing me at airports, hardware stores, etc.The point - I had to learn from the Internet on how to be a man. That has been a double edged sword. There is a lot of misinformation on the web during the early 2000's.The problem - my Nmom doesn't like anyone to stand up to her.**The bigger problem** \- in addition to this emasculating parental dynamic, she has been sabotaging my masculinity literally since I was 3-4 years old.Let's start at 13 - ""Are you gay?!""(For the record - I support gay rights. I a couple gay friends from college. Incredibly fun, respectful and intelligent people)That has been a reoccurring aggressive question throughout my life. No matter how many times I say no, no matter how many pick up artist books she found from 13-18 year old using her credit card - she still presses on. It has been used to attack me. To break me down so I'm easier to influence. So she feels better about herself.A normal mom would help me get a girlfriend. Speak well about me. Ask her friends.A Nmom would continue to insult. Would get drunk on her birthday and tell me the only woman I can attract is a mongoliod and laugh at me, etc.In her defense, I've never had a serious girlfriend. Lots of women - mostly flings.Against her - why the hell should I trust women after the severe lifetime's worth of emotional beatings I've taken from her?I've done a lot of healing work to get through this. I want to learn to be with women intimately and sexually and not just sexually. However, I have major trust issues. And any of you on this thread that have had a lifetime of gas lighting can understand (I hope).**Pinnacle**:It reached its peak during a Thanksgiving two years ago. I was going through a rough time at work. My family invited a bunch of their friends over including this random Serbian dude they met on the plane. Without asking - my mom put me on the kids side of this large 16 person table. To add insult to injury, she put little trees between the adults and the kids (and I...). It was a symbolic ""fuck you."" When I confronted her about it, she said that X 8-10 year old boy wanted to talk to me. She gave that glazed look with her fake voice.Oh. Thanks for asking me. You basically let a kid choose my seating.What occurred next was the weaponization of his child-like innocence.20 questions - an escalation of innocent to deeply insulting questions:1. What is your favorite color?2. Who is your best friend?3. Why are you friends?4. Do you love him?5. Do you like guys?6. EtcI answered calmly. I noticed his father only half heatedly told him to stop from beyond the trees (he was sitting next to the boy...).At that point I realized - this was planned. It was a setup. Perhaps she (and her friends - which hurts because she is talking poorly behind my back and spreading rumors about me) thought they could get this kid to make me admit that I am gay. And maybe that's what she led them to believe to get them to use this boy in that way. The truth - to break me down. A tit for tat for maybe something I did that she didn't like.It left me feeling disillusioned. At one of my lowest points, admist burnout everyone knows about, I get put down. In the most severe, indirect, subversive way (she is born/raised in Asia in the upper class so this symbolic, high context, indirect communication style is her mainstay).Fast forward to 2018 -I finally open up to my best friend since grade school that my mom has been calling me gay all my life. He was shocked. He did not see or understand the kind of shit my mother subjects me to. He also said no one thinks I'm gay at all. More proof that she was trying to gaslight me.And then...he betrayed me.He basically told everyone what I said to him and that I was gay. Now everyone is asking me these subtle indirect questions they haven't asked me before ""Sooo do you have a girlfriend?"" Hell we were having a chat in a room at a friends place. I made the usual dick jokes. He comes out to the rest of the guys saying ""Yup there was a lot of talk about dicks!""All (8) people stare at me.He even told other childhood friends not part of those circles. Now I have my so-called best friend ruining the reputation I worked so hard to build. Everything is now being framed in people's minds that I am secretly gay all this time:1. Oh he only hung out with dudes because he wanted them secretly (no it's normal for guys to hang w/ guys and vice versa).2. Oh he only helped these two dudes for a year teaching them to weight lift for free because he wanted the D (no - I wanted to help uplift these guys to be better versions of themselves).3. Oh he only helped X person because he was gay (no I love helping others its an intrinsic motivation).4. Oh he's never had a girlfriend because he was gay (no, I have major trust issues with women because my mother has abused me, but if I tell others she loses face in a community and country she has worked so hard to be part of. I would be sabotaging her if I told you all the truth).Why is this so damaging? Because I went to Catholic school from K to College. I have held many different leadership in the Catholic community. And we all know Catholic stances on homosexuality. I would be shunned. And many people in my mom's circle already started to ignore me when I said hello.WTF is going on?**Conclusion**:I left in the most gangster (yet non-violent way) - I stood up and walked out. From everything. I finally had the funds to do it for the first time in my life.I remember having one last conversation with my baby sister before I left. They parentified her. They didn't want to have a deep/emotional conversation with me. When I told her that mom used the boy at Thanksgiving to see if I was gay - she looked down sheepishly. She said he was just a kid...""Christ was she on it too?"" I thought. She then said that mom told her that she was ready to help me through it if I was gay. ""WTF - how come this narcissist somehow uses her attacks against me to make herself look good???!?! This woman is a PR machine.""I then pulled out some straight pick up artist books to show my baby sister. Under any other situation that would be shameful. But in defending my sexuality and personal truth - I had to. I couldn't leave her thinking I was gay. My mother stripped any sort of a relationship I could have with my baby sister - she made her think I was stupid so she never asked me for help in school, she made her think I was bad, and she made her think I was gay.It was a long process to leave everything behind. However, I've been alone and misunderstood all my life. Instead of feeling alone in a group, it's better to have real solitude all by yourself.So I jumped.No contact. I've had no contact with anybody from my past life except one childhood friend. I don't even tell him where I'm at. Just that I'm alive. Same with my parents. It's been over (8) months.I deleted all social media (various reasons - it makes you depressed, the Zuck doesn't care about your privacy, it interferes w/ your ability to concentrate/produce deep/valuable work, etc.).The only way is to reach me by phone and email. And man has it been depressing how few people have checked to see I'm alive. The ones that do have an ulterior motive (they don't really care - they are just curious and shameless and will report to a larger group of people once they get the desired info).I am much better after (8) months of solo travel. It has been a major growth experience. One thing I have learned to do is to walk away when others disrespect me. I stand up for myself, but my tolerance for others violating my [fundamental human rights](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201406/how-spot-and-stop-manipulators) has decreased significantly.**Why is she like this?**It is complex, but here is one reason. I am the only man on my father's side to carry down my family name. My cousin got his tubes tied. He doesn't want kids. I completely control the future of my family's lineage since we live in a patriarchal system. I didn't realize the power of my gender in this situation until just before I left. I started to say I would leave, have a son and start a new life. And holy shit did that not only strike a cord with her but my dad's self  proclaimed ""patriarch of the family"" sister. She tried to convince me to be transgender at the lowest point of my life before I left.Perhaps she knew that from the moment my cousin got his tubes tied. Perhaps she resented me for my power (in that way).She wanted me to be gay all along. She wanted me to lose my power. So she hit and hit and hit and hit and hit. All of her punches landed. And I still nonviolently walked away w/ class and grace."
none,"Hi all, For those that have achieved FIRE in a nonlinear fashion or have taken interesting detours and are still trying to achieve FIRE - what has your journey looked like? How have you been able to recover from a momentum loss from an extended break? \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The average mantra of ""work until 65 then retire"" seems rather linear. So does the ""grind and save 64% of your take home pay until 30 like [Mr. Money Mustache's graph](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/years_to_retirement.png), invest, then retire, decompress, take your first vacation, then find more fulfilling work on your terms"" mantra of the FIRE community. There is another nuance in the FIRE community: not everyone can be $100k a year software developers like Mr. and Mrs. Money Mustache. It'll take longer with jobs that pay less. Along with changing local real estate economies that can make a home buy a nightmare if the area tanks. \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In my experience, life isn't linear. You lose a job, get a new one, get burnt out, make a bad investment decision, etc. Willingly (or unwillingly via job loss) taking an extended break (6-12 months) seems to be out of the question in the FIRE community (from what I've seen). The break could be to think harder about your purpose, recover from burnout, or you lost your job and  are forced to break. \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here's my story:My father was a painter (spring/summer/some fall) and built/rented/renovated homes. He and my mother have their MBA's, but have never worked for someone else. My dad graduated university and barely bought his first home for $12k, renovated it and sold it for $36k. At the time he figured, why the heck would I want to work some corporate job for someone else? He didn't know (at the time) that he got lucky with the economy picking up. Fast forward - as a kid I've always worked with my father painting, digging ditches, renovating homes, etc. My working hours with him extended at 10 years old onwards. I remember all his tenants would leave the house a mess. My dad was too generous. He has only been to small claims course twice in his 30+ year landlording career. Turning over the homes was always a pain because of his kind heart. Cutting out carpet with a box knife b/c the tenants let their cats piss all over the floor. Garbage all over the front/back yards to pick up. Digging ditches in the rain for the plumber to lay his pipe, sweeping floors, making dump runs, etc. I didn't have a job in high school, but instead always had one with my dad. I did pretty well in high school - martial arts freshman to junior year, swimming and crew junior to senior year and ASB president for my entire school senior year. 3.44 GPA. My mother never came to any of my sporting events. My father never provided me guidance, but came to the martial arts events. It seemed my college was already chosen for me. My father, grandfather and many family members went to this private university. What is sad is that if my dad supported me I could've been a rower at an elite rower at this prestigious university. I still kick myself when the coach could've gotten me in for rowing. But...I didn't take it. I didn't know how to think for myself. I was always ""guided"" by my mother and avoided by my father. No one in my family even cared to ask about how my regattas went. It was always about them. **College hits** \- I start window cleaning for College Pro for a few months in the late Spring of my freshman year (3 months). First time working for someone other than my dad. 1. I then get my first office job for my university in late June - the summer of my freshman year. Quit the window cleaning job and put on my white collar for the first time. I don't quit this job until I graduate. This is a 10-15 hour a week commitment that rises up to 40 hours in the school year. 2. Make an attempt at a second internship in spring of my Sophomore year through my Fraternity. I get fired. I took too much on. Amateur mistake, but my rep does take a blow with the Brother who helped me get the job. I also take it way too personally at the time.    1. I never told my parents about this out of massive fear of a loss of love. 3. Pick up my second job as a receptionist/administrator at a local real estate office in the summer of my Sophomore year through another Fraternity Brother. I don't quit this job until I graduate, but I come close to burnout many times. It is a weekend job so Saturday/Sunday - 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.    1. This was by far my favorite work environment. The real estate agents were all batting over $100k (I looked at their salaries when I scanned their HUD statements). They were kind, hard working, ambitious and focused on the community. Flexible hours, but always working in some way. It gave me a view at a different lifestyle than the old 9-5. 4. Pick up my third job as a recruiting intern in the Fall of my senior year. 10-15 hour time commitment. This put me at three jobs concurrently for the last (9) months of my college career.    1. On top of all this I am part of a Fraternity and am running my own club with an average of 23 members a year from Sophomore Spring Quarter to the end of university.    2. I am also throwing at least (2) house parties a month junior year onwards (gosh when I write this out I definitely pushed myself way too much).    3. Why did I do all this? I didn't know what I wanted to do. I took one of my Fraternity Brother's advice and used the shotgun method to figure it out. Unfortunately, I never figured out what I wanted to do. 5. My father gives me management over the rental we both worked on to covert into a duplex during my Junior year until now.    1. I start dealing with two sets of tenants.    2. I start collecting rent.    3. I go to small claims court once in college.    4. I get tossed into a fire he could've prepared me for, but I am grateful for the opportunity to learn (and the income) regardless.    5. No mortgage. He bought it outright in cash in 2012 at a low point in the local market. As college concludes:1. I quit my first office job at the school on good terms. 2. I quit my second job on good terms. 3. My third recruiting intern job both me and the fellow student who recruited me get fired. It is a small recruiting shop and he couldn't afford us anymore. 4. 3.21. GPA. Solid given everything I did. 5. $21k student loan that I started paying down my Junior year in college. 6. No credit card or other debts. Unemployed for the first time ever (when I started working I stopped helping my dad - he understood) I had no clue what to do or what I wanted to do. It was jarring. I didn't even think to travel because I was so into the mindset that I had to achieve. I later learned that was because I always wanted to earn the love of my parents. I later learned they were narcissists. They had a limited capacity for empathy and love. The most sobering realization of 2018. My mother kept pushing me to get a college job. I graduated a quarter early and walked in the June. I thought I could rest, but she kept pushing and pushing. It was as if she didn't want me to travel Asia for (6) months by myself like my sister did (2 years younger than me, same university). I later learned she didn't want me to have independence. She wanted me under her thumb. Long story. **Corporate Career**:1. I get a temp job at a Fortune 500 company working HR. $40k a year aka 20 an hour. Hourly not salaried. No health benefits. I don't like it. I come in burnt out. I was not ready for this big corporate fast paced tech environment. My parents couldn't guide me either. They never had a corporate job. I felt like a keyboard monkey. There are two other temps gunning for the same job. It is a hostile environment especially since one was from Miami and was unnecessarily competitive. I later discovered this is how a lot of people in Florida are. I get fired on my baby sister's 14th birthday. (5) month tenure.    1. No warning. I walk out, say goodnight to my boss who smiles back at me, then suddenly my badge won't work to get into the bike locker. I ask security. They said my badge doesn't work. I think that's silly. Eventually some fellow HR people come out. I ask for help. One of the two goes into get someone. The other asks if I enjoy my job. I didn't understand what the subtext of that question was until I left. Another coworker comes in to help me get my bike. I like her. She smiles. I bike home. My roommate thought I would get fired. I naively shrugged it off until I got the call from my temp agency. Three sentences of feedback. One sentence was on point, the other two were BS.  I called the co-manager who explained the situation to me. I was devastated.    2. I did get the benefit of seeing everyone's offer letter (I was tasked with auditing them). I saw resumes and concluded that at least in the tech industry - the more lateral moves you make, the more money you make. Staying at a company can be lucrative only if it is growing company and you are hatched onto the coattails of a star manager or are a star performer yourself.    3. I only told my parents about this job loss once I had another lined up out of massive fear of loss of love. 2. A month after I got fired I get a call for two jobs - it's either corporate real estate or insurance. I choose the former because it was at least in line with what my father did (bad decision in the fulfillment/know thyself section). I negotiate three months until my second job starts. I am stressing the whole time from the trauma of losing my first job and feeling like a piece of garbage for not doing anything. I will be a vendor for the same Fortune 500 company I was a temp at. Managed to negotiate up $3k for $48k a year. Project Coordinator was my title. Full health benefits b/c I was a full time employee for that company (first time being an FTE salaried and not hourly ever!). (10) month tenure.    1. I was told raises were 2% a year which sounded depressing because (like my father with flipping homes) I experienced a 20% salary increase from the 1st to the 2nd job.    2. Made getting my real estate license one of my yearly goals (normal goal since this is a corporate real estate company). Slept on the floor of my office after work from 5-5:30 p.m. then studied until 8 or 9 p.m. M-F for three months. I passed all tests.     3. A few months into the job it turns out my boss is a major micromanager. She goes on maternity leave. A more chill military fellow approves a transfer I lined up within that company to be a vendor to a new company. 3. New job as a vendor for this tech company. I managed to negotiate up $5k to $60k a year. 25% salary increase from the last job. First time in this new project manager position. Everything is new. This is place is far slower than my last job. I am being worked into it way slower than I wanted to. I pick up my first real estate client in January 2017 and close on his first home in mid-May 2017 making a $17k commission on the side. I am a fool for telling two coworkers about it.    1. I get a new boss in January as well. She was the subordinate of my old boss who (I later realized) is grooming her. During our first goals meeting I was an idiot and revealed my ambition - to get a job that she was secretly gunning for. I noticed her attitude immediately changed towards me. She started to see me as competition.    2. I started to lose hair because of all the subtle abuse and micromanaging. It felt like I was her dog.    3. It was a long drawn out battle, but I eventually got a new job. 4. New job - first real construction project management job. Same Fortune 500 company. I am a vendor. But different vendor company as an FTE. I manage to negotiate up $2.5k to $72.5k a year with a 10% yearly bonus based on performance. This is my 4th job in two years and looking at total compensation I have successfully doubled my salary in less than (2) years. (6) months later I get a raise to 3% base salary raise to  $74,625 and my full 10% bonus paid out (prorated since I started in the middle of the year) in month (9).  (13) month tenure.   1. This job wasn't a good fit for me either. HOWEVER, this boss was a chill dude. He did not micromanage me at all. Ironically, he didn't manage at all. He was so hands off and broad that it felt like working for my dad again. I later learned this was a transition job to something better for him. He had good timing.      1. I was good at it and got customer compliments often. One was even featured on our bid when the Fortune 500 company made us bid our business to other competitors.    2. I eventually left on the same day my boss and our team's project coordinator left. I said I was going to be a real estate agent, but that thought changed after my last day (see below). People thought it was planned. Neither of us talked about it w/ each other. (2) months later our company lost half of the business to another competitor. My job and (49) others out of 100 employees were lost. Many were hired back to the company that won the partial bid. I was offered a role, but didn't want it.       1. Side note - people at work did not like my decision. Leaving a W-2 FTE job for a 1099 job seemed to be an affront to their values. Some didn't even congratulate me. One coworker called me a traitor. Lots of passive aggressiveness all around. Only a small handful of genuine people. **Life After Corporate America**This all took place within (3) years. And I have to say I was miserable every second of it. I put on so many masks to fool myself into liking what I did. I adapted to so many different corporate cultures I was exhausted. When the mirror broke I was devastated. In the context of my whole life, I am a duty bound and ambitious man. For example, the main Fortune 500 company decided to poach me two months into my last corporate job. I was so grateful of being hired out of a bad last job to a chill manager that my loyalty did not match reality. I declined and told my boss that I did. Looking back - I probably should've taken it. But then again I took an Adrenal Test and was burnt out. I wouldn't have last in even more demanding company that I was fired from initially in Job 1 given my energy levels. Choosing to leave was like committing mental harakiri. I took such a hard emotion and psychological blow. The grief was almost unbearable and I had no one to help me through it. But there was no shortage of people that wanted to kick me while I was down. THIS TIME I did tell my parents the truth before I quit. This time I did tell them that in two months after quitting I was going to see all (50) states by myself (I've already been to Alaska/Hawaii). And holy shit did they use every single person I ever met in my life to try to get me from going on this trip. No love. Absolutely getting ignored. The dog doesn't get any treats when he doesn't do what the master wants. I cannot tell you how I was attacked on so many angles by so many people in my life. I chose the USA because I felt it was wise. I went through all this trauma that the extra stressor of having to learn another language/system would push me overboard. I also wanted to learn more about my country of birth especially under this polarizing presidency. I've also realized I've been everywhere else except my own country. Time to pay homage. And lastly, I realized if I was to make any serious money (I am a realist as well as someone seeking fulfillment) the best system to do it is the USA. I went against the American ideals embedded in my family - business is a virtue, if you're not working you are worthless, internal achievement pales in comparison to external achievement, travelling your own country instead of another country is uncultured and intellectually lazy, etc. Cousins and friends alike laughed at my decision. And my God did I feel the heat. But I announced a date in advance. I could've left in the middle night like a coward when my parents were aboard. However, I stood my ground and left with dignity. My mother hated it. We are no longer in the third world country she grew up in. She chose America and got her citizenship the hard way (not through marriage). She also chose American defiance, ingenuity, freedom, and the right to pursue anything within the law. Little did she know that that system allowed her son to live a life absolutely free from her control. The system of the old world would have allowed her to have such a tight grip on me. And here I am. Living in the first real major choice of my life. Unlike my corporate career, I wasn't pushed and manipulated into it by my mother. The massive resistance from every single person in my life tells me it was all against their interests especially my mother. And that makes me feel like this choice is truly original - uninfluenced by anyone. Call it selfish. Call it self compassionate. It depends on your perception. To summarize, before I left:1. I quit my job.2. I had a leadership volunteer position I found tough to leave behind in my community. 3. I gave up my real estate license I worked so hard for. 4. I permanently deleted my LinkedIn (kinda starting a new life here) that I've been polishing since Sophomore year in university. 5. I permanently deleted all forms of social media (I figured it would only depress me further and I wanted to make decisions on my own without the influence of others).    1. I also wanted more authentic relationships. 6. I narrowed my forms of communication to my cell phone and email. 7. I went no contact with everyone except my family to let them know I am alive. 8. Student loan has been paid down to $3k for a $50 a month payment to keep it for length of credit and credit mix (better credit score essentially). It's been (8) months of travel across (23) states by car. It's been a true journey. My dual goals are to seek purpose and a new place to live. I have a list now. It's just time to seek more clarity to make a real choice. It's been eye opening to say the least. Solo travel is different when: A. You are under massive trauma from job loss, family emotional abuse, a hostile work environment, adrenal fatigue/stage 4 burnout, a few betrayals from friends before departure. B. You are not with a tour group or family to filter how others treat you. Despite having traveled all over the world, it is like I am seeing the world for the first time. And boy is it stressful. I do have fun, but again I have been focusing more on exploring myself, the USA and healing. C. You are looking for an entirely new place to live. D. You are looking for an entirely new line of work. E. You have absolutely no approval from anyone in your life and all the resistance in the world. F. You are absolutely alone on your journey. Not exactly relaxing. &#x200B;I did have some resources others didn't:A. A house that generates $31k gross income a year w/ no mortgage. (Although unlike the car the title is not in my name. My parents wouldn't do that because if they pull my inheritance it would give me full reason to make a completely clean cut. Also, it would invalidate all the legal battles they fought from those trying to sue them for their wealth in order to control them and their decisions). B. Saved $70k since I mainly lived with my parents, don't drink alcohol, don't drink coffee, and don't do any drugs. C. Have a credit score of 823 out of 850. D. Had COBRA from quitting work for health insurance. E. Had a Health Savings Account (HSA) that I saved $6k+ in for acupuncture (surprisingly an eligible expense) or other health problems. F. A car fully paid off that I've had for a decade (family gift at 16 if you want to count that privilege against me for any reason). &#x200B;But privileges aside, you can see I work like a dog and have certainly been treated like one. I can live off this income indefinitely. I know how to cook. I am excellent with a lot of FIRE principles. Reducing expenses is easy for me. I slept on the floor for (3) years from Junior year in college into my corporate career. I have been practicing 1-7 days of fasting (mainly intermittent fasting) since Sophomore year in college. But simply having FIRE is obviously not fulfilling. I am grateful I have achieved it. However, I want to achieve more. My next step will be to get back into the game somehow and in a more fulfilling line of work. I will have the power of FIRE and the newfound business ability to walk away from any negotiation/situation (I walked away from everything I knew and love. I managed to survive the grief - what not could I walk away from now?). And maybe in another three years (if I don't choose correctly or disaster occurs) I take another (8) month travel break. I wouldn't want to. I would love to just find my purpose and not worry about it. But life isn't linear. It is pretty non-linear. What's your story?"
none,"Hi all,TL,DR: People (other drivers, police, etc) treat you better when you have a luxury car.  Tesla has a community with those superchargers which I rely on. I find myself having more conversations with Tesla owners and the random bloke who approaches me while charger to compliment me on my car. A faster car is safer. People tail you much less out of fear of a legal battle. Regenerative breaking takes the conflict out of braking yourself. I also embrace conflict more because I feel safer in my Tesla. People try to race you in a Tesla.How has your driving experience changed from upgrading to a Tesla?**Background:**I've driven through (19) states in (8) months with my black Subaru Forester that I've driven for a decade. 0-60 mph is 10 seconds. I got it repainted, repaired and detailed to look like new before I left. I bought a new 2019 Red Model 3 (AWD, Dual Motor, Premium black seats, 19"" sport wheels, 315 mile range) outside of WA DC. 0-60 mph is 4.5 seconds. They currently have the temporary Virginia plates. I am now in NYC.Here are some insights I'd like to share driving the Subaru Forester:1. In Seattle (where I'm from) - it's the car of choice. Some people try to cut you off on the road. But for the most part it's a neutral car. No compliments on it. It's just there.2. Oregon - same situation. More ""red"" parts of Oregon I've noticed I get tailed hard by some truck drivers who think their vehicle is superior. I move over since my Subaru's 0-60 is bad.3. California - People in San Francisco, Berkley, etc all seem to drive both fast and unpredictably. No one liked seeing a Subaru in the fast lane and would cut me off by passing on the right a lot even if I was the fastest driver there.4. Nevada/Arizona - Easy driving due to the expansiveness and sparse population of the Wild West.5. New Mexico - went out to a bar with some AirBnB hosts. One of the hosts was a bit tipsy. He called my Subaru a ""Lesbaru."" Of course I got that once or twice in Seattle in the last decade, but I'm starting to realize how much the rest of the USA is a car culture. A car really defines you. He drove a Ford Mustang (a predatory/overly masculine looking car).   1. Fast forward to Central Florida. I went to AT&T to get a new phone. The service person literally told me ""When you see someone with that kind of car roll up (Points to an old couple with a luxury Mercedes) you definitely make a better effort to help them."" I could see his attitude completely change to pander to them. Even after they stated they needed some help and weren't going to buy anything new (not sure if he gets a commission or is metrics driven).6. Colorado - like Seattle - the car of choice. Some truck drivers that didn't want to follow behind me in Oregon. Not as aggressive as California or Florida/Miami drivers. No compliments. There was this one store owner in Southern Colorado that assumed I was poor. He said I couldn't afford what I was looking for. I thanked him and walked out. He followed me to look at my new looking Subaru in awe. The look on his face was priceless. I think this was a ""under promise (his beliefs on people like me) and over deliver (he expected me to be driving a beat up Honda Civic)"" situation instead of an admiration for Subaru Forester.7. Oklahoma - chill. I felt like a roaming buffalo. No one bothered me.8. Texas - people here are respectful. I just notice that grown men from small children drive a truck even if they don't use it for its functional purpose. Not as aggressive as Cali/FL but more aggressive than Oregon/Colorado. Getting cut off a decent bit even if I am driving in the middle lane.9. LA, MS, AL - scary. The people here have a heavy truck culture. Many beat up cars and the poverty is noticeable in both the roads and cars. NOLA has the worst roads in the USA in my opinion. I got tailed A LOT in New Orleans by angry people. Mainly people with a handicap pass. There was a sort of anger in their driving I felt against my car. In Cali it is a sense of urgency. Better economies. Here I was rubbing against anger at an outsider (WA state plates), a unique (for the area) Japanese car, poverty, and what felt like a complex racial history (driving in some neighborhoods in NOLA I would get people mugging my license plate hard).   1. This is where I saw the most ""hire a lawyer"" signs. It started in Arizona. But man I did not realize how litigious the USA was until I saw all these signs. Intellectually, I know were are a ""I'm going to sue you"" culture. But experiencing it is a whole different story. You don't see any ""hire this lawyer"" signs in Seattle. It is extremely uncommon. I guess you can say we are more chill/low key in the Northwest.10. Florida - these people are unnecessarily competitive on the road. It gets more cutthroat the more south you go in Florida. People tend to tail you hard whether you are in central/north/south FL. It's almost as if they are saying ""I can control your speed by driving faster behind you to cause you to drive faster."" I do not have this ""tailing effect"" in a Tesla. The luxury/newness of the car combined with the regenerative braking causes fear in others. They also may realize there are cameras all over the car if they are educated on Tesla. Miami was a scary place to drive in general, but especially with my Subaru Forester. Everyone seems to have a nice car the closer you get to West Palm Beach. I just wonder how much they put down for it....11. Georgia - this is a place where the police tried to get me the most. Slowing down to catch my speed. Purposely driving behind me, etc. Atlanta is known for its road rage and I experienced an episode there. Some guy was angry that I turned left when the sign said I couldn't I followed three local drivers who did the same thing. Rush hour. He tried to block me. So I reversed the car as if to go the other way. He pulled forward. Then I pulled forward to go behind him. He was yelling at me from his window like no other. Again - I don't think this would've happened in a Tesla.12. North/South Carolina/Tennessee - unexpectedly nice. Asheville, NC seems to have a lot of Subaru's since it is so close to the Blue Ridge/Smoky Mountains. I didn't move to far into Tennessee. I did get tailed a bit though especially moving from Tennessee to NC on the highways. People wave at you here in some more rural parts. Nice touch until they see I'm not from around there.13. Virginia - coming into VA from Boone, NC was chill. Rural drivers in VA are super nice. The waving as you pass someone was new to me. I noticed this is Asheville, NC, but it was more pronounced here. It got a bit tougher in Roanoke/Richmond, but not as tough as ""red"" parts of Oregon. (I've learned to equate ""red"" political parts of the USA with trucks based on my observations. Trucks tend to think they own the road since if we crashed they would be safe. A feeling of dominance from being higher up).14. Bonus - WA DC - some sporadic driving, but nothing as wild as Cali or FL. No Mercedes wanted to be behind me in any lane, but no aggression in the driving either. Surprising. I was expecting a more ""House of Cards"" driving style. However, traffic in DC is so congested even during 1-2 p.m. People aren't trying to get places with the Cali sense of urgency and the lack the Miami Forza aggression.15. General - people in the USA distrust strangers especially after 9/11. Coming with West Coast WA state plates and perhaps a rare-to-the-area Japanese car triggers a bit of distrust of strangers/xenophobia.\^Never had a problem with anyone hitting my car (parked or otherwise) in any of these states.The Tesla Experience - Virginia Temporary Plates:1. WA DC - people just don't mess with me at all. I use to be overly respectful (a cultural thing) about braking to inconvenience the other person (odd I know). Now regenerative braking does that for me and people BACK THE F UP. They do not want to hit a new Tesla (again they read the plates).2. Maryland - Passive place. People that would've tailed me back off. I was warned Baltimore is a crime ridden place. It was fine to me. Driving wasn't bad at all. There was no one that attempted to ride me or even cut me off. Chill place.3. Delaware - a pretty passive place road rage wise. I felt more respect on the road. People that would've tried to ride me out of the fast lane for miles just go into the right lane and politely pass me from there. Not many pass me though because the acceleration is crazy (for me). Wilmington is a surprisingly crime ridden place. I was worried about parking on the street for the night I was there. No problems. Again respect on the road.4. Philadelphia, PA - Easy place to drive, but I took the subway into Center City. One random guy in Chinatown complimented me on my car as I was parking.5. New Jersey - generally chill. Compliments on my car from a random stranger as I was waiting for my Tesla to charge. Some surprised looks from people who expected to see an old man and see a young man in his late 20's.6. NYC - this is a different sort of aggressive than Miami or Cali. People weave in and out of lanes casually. They definitely respect the Tesla, but will jump at the opportunity to get past me. Not in an aggressive ""F you"" way. More in a ""I'm trying to get somewhere nothing personal buddy"" way. A lot of people are standing their cars in the right lane. Sometimes just to chat and they are obviously holding up traffic. There is a IDGAF attitude about that here.   1. People also tend to get close to you on either side, but again I'm not too worried. They don't back up as much as the other above states, but they definitely don't ride me.   2. Funny story I was driving 65 in a 50 south on the I-87 at night. A cop put on his lights. I was actually far more calm than I was about that when I was pulled over on the I-40 in Cali going into Arizona. I put my emergency lights on. Then switched to my right lane blinker. I moved a lane expecting the cop to move with me. He kept pushing forward. Then his lights turned off. One guy just didn't move out of the cops way lol. The cop chilled and turned his lights off. Odd. I've noticed this a lot though. Cops around here just put on their lights to move past a red or push past someone. I thought I was going to get a ticket. Maybe he saw my car, figured I had money and thought I wasn't worth the fight? Or maybe he just wanted to move faster or perhaps assert dominance? Regardless, I got off Scott free.\^Never had a problem with anyone hitting my car. NYC worries me b/c a lot of people have these odd bumper guards that hang from their truck (even as they drive which looks tacky). However, [you can park you car on the same block for (7) days before it gets towed](https://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/faq/481/how-long-can-a-car-with-license-plates-be-parked-on-the-street). [Seattle it's (3) days.](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/parking-program/parking-regulations/72-hour-on-street-parking-ordinance) I do feel safer with a faster car. No one is mugging my plates b/c they assume I am East Coast (wonder if this will change when I get my WA state plates). But everyone recognizes it is a new car b/c of the temporary plates.\^\^The distinct lifestyle change from mainly crumby gas stations to upscale malls/nicer areas where Superchargers are has affected the quality of people I encounter. I don't even look at gas stations anymore.How has your driving experience changed from upgrading to a Tesla?"
none,"Hi all,I'm on the verge of getting a long range RWD custom model 3 with ultra white vegan leather seats. $2.5k down on a standard plus but I'm changing my mind for that extra 85 mile range (an extra $6k is worth it as many of you pointed out). On one hand, there is this female Youtuber mom (Like Tesla is the channels name) who spills the unspeakable on her ultra white seats. No stains. She also has a vid at 25k mikes showing it's still kosher.On the other hand, there is this YouTuber named Bjorn who shows after 75k miles his ultra white driver seat took a beating. The other seats look fine. I think a subtle difference I remember reading was that his seats were perforated. New Teslas' all lack that perforation which minimizes tears (correct me if I'm wrong here).Not sure if he regularly cleaned/maintained them or not. But the tear on the drivers seat nearest the entry tells me that kind of damage may be inevitable with white seats. Or that would happen with black and he is just rough on his car.Personally, I live in Seattle so black would help with heat, but that's not a factor in my decision making process. Regardless, I want to ask a new question - would the resale value of a long range RWD model 3 with ultra white seats be higher than one with a black interior? (Assuming I maintain the white vegan leather weekly and the black only monthly - both responding quickly to spills). I plan to get a four year $10k loan just to boost my credit (I can afford the loan meaning I could pay all cash but choose to go into debt to improve my credit mix). After four years, I plan to buy a more expensive Tesla. I'll be more familiar with the brand/technology by then to make a more expensive purchasing decision."
none,"I have a complicated situation. I am buying a Tesla in a completely different state than I am registered in. I did a test drive of a Tesla for the first time on 3/22/19. The salesperson didn't do a great job at explaining my options. His associate was borderline rude. Suggesting due to my young age that I can't afford it. Despite being dressed well and articulate, it was obvious they thought I wouldn't buy a Tesla. But I put the $2.5k down. [Changed some perspectives. I later read that Elon prides himself on his Tesla salespeople being the worst in the industry](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-ranked-last-on-a-survey-ranking-auto-salespeople-2018-7).  I am travelling so we had it shipped from Chicago to a Tesla dealer near me in the same state.Whatever. As I learn more about Tesla, I realize that I do have an extra $6k to upgrade from the Model 3 Standard Range Plus (RWD) to the Long Range Model 3 (RWD). Why not? It has an extra 85 mile range.I email this salesperson a couple times and call him back every single time. He slowly responds. He stopped responding when I asked about changing the car. I then called the next day. A sales associate of his says he will be back tomorrow. Okay. I call the next day. A different sales associate of his says him and the manager will both me in tomorrow.Tomorrow is today (3/29/19). I wake up and see my delivery is today. I say ""Fuck it - let's just go with the first shorter range option."" I drive 41 minutes to CarMax to sell my car for what they quoted it for. As they were checking my paperwork, I decided to call the Tesla my car was supposed to be at today. The salesperson transfereed me to their delivery team. After 30 rings, I hung up. I called the delivery team specifically. A young woman picked up. She told me it wasn't in the store today. She said, despite the text I got from Tesla, that it is scheduled to be delivered this Sunday (two days from now). She asked how I was paying which seemed odd. She then gave a halfhearted apology.No updates from Tesla regarding this. I've read that delivery can be a pain, but I find this unprofessional.Now I have to get an AirBnB to spend an extra night to then sell my car, Uber to Tesla, and then buy my new car ($40k down, $10k Tesla financing, but if that's too high I will pay all cash). The CarMax deal is still good through this Tuesday. However, this is starting to become a matter of pride. I'm questioning if I should give this guy the sale or walk from the deal.I now plan to call my original salesperson to figure out why he didn't respond to my email three days ago...Is this a normal Tesla experience?I get Tesla is the hot woman in the club when it comes to car dealers. However, that doesn't justify poor customer service and follow up.Questions:1. Every salesperson at Tesla I've talked to says the $2.5k down is refundable. Is that true?2. Would you recommend I complain to the manager?3. Would you wait another (2) weeks for a custom 325 mile Model 3 vs the 240 mile Standard Range Plus Model 3 if you had an extra $6k?4. Do Tesla salespeople play petty games with people they don't think will buy their car?5. Do Tesla salespeople not have incentives to work with a customer who changes their order last minute?6. Any other thoughts?3/30/19 Update:Looks like the situation is almost resolved due to my persistence today:Called the sales number instead of the original sales rep (OSR) I worked with in Virginia. It patched me through to a store near me where I was supposed to receive my original standard range plus ($44,500, 240 mile range, red, black interior, 19"" wheels, auto pilot). I calmly told the delivery specialist that I wanted to change to custom. However, the OSR didn't answer any calls or emails from 3/26 until 3/30 and has yet to call/email back. I talked to four of his colleagues who either said he was out for (2) days in a row or both him and the manager were helping a customer. They took my number for a callback that never happend about (3) times. She looked for a solution and found on in a city near me: AWD Long Range (310 miles), red, premium black interior, 19"" wheels, auto pilot for $53k. They gave me a $2.4k discount since it was a showroom car with much less than 50 miles. I am planning to pick it up tomorrow afternoon. Concurrently, I emailed [CustomerSupport@tesla.com](mailto:CustomerSupport@tesla.com) two days ago due to my poor sales experience with my OSR. A rep from my state (Vancouver, WA) called, texted and emailed me today. That was heartening. Except I was in Maryland... I thanked her and told her I was being taken car of. For a sec I wanted white for a custom, but I'm not trying to wait for a custom for two weeks during my road trip. This is a gift from God and I will gladly take it. Question:1. Should I ask for 6 months of free supercharging, matching CarMax's $5k quote on my car (they valued it at $4.3k), and/or something else?"
none,"I was at a car dealer and the salesperson helping me asked my ethnicity during our car conversation. He asked respectfully, but I also found it odd. It was my first time meeting him and had nothing to do with the topic of conversation we were on. Out of the blue question. I answered, but it's the first time that happened to me in a business situation with someone I had just met. What do you think and how would you respond?I think it's unprofessional unless you have major rapport with the customer. It's okay to ask on on the streets. I prefer it when people do (respectfully). But not during a business interaction even though it's informational. "
none,"I am in an interesting situation. I made a bold move. I decided to buy a brand new car on a road trip around the USA. Let's skip the whole ""it's fiscally stupid to buy a brand new car"" comments and focus on the problem at hand.Below is my situation follow by questions:**Car Financials:**Put $2,500 down today to get the vehicle delivered to the DC area where I will be spending two weeks. Fully refundable. I can back out anytime before then.Car Price: $45,700Est. Amt Due: $48,453.55\^This does not include the $3,250 tax credit which I benefit when I complete my taxes before next April 15, 2020.* Standard Range Plus Rear-Wheel Drive Model.**Timeline and Mission:**\*Dual Mandate\* Vehicle will be delivered to the DC area within the next 14 days. In that timeline I have to both find a private buyer for my car and an auto loan.Trading my 2010 Subaru Forester in excellent condition (WA State Plates) and the Kelly Blue Book quote they gave me is about $6,500. I believe I can get another grand or two on the open market if I can find a quick buyer fast enough.I am a registered citizen of WA state (10.1% sales tax in Seattle); however, since I am buying this in Virginia I do benefit from the Virginia 4.3% sales tax. I will be swapping my WA plates onto this Tesla (yeah complicated situation, but the WA DOL said to report the vehicle sale to them so I avoid any liability, swap the plates, tell them, then I am kosher. Easier than I originally thought).No debt on my Subaru. Clean title. Excellent condition. 92,000 miles.**Credit Score:**Credit Karma: 800 - Transunion and Equifax via Vantage Score 3.0Discover Card: 803 via Transunion but it was 821 on Dec 2018 and Feb 2019.BoA: 801  FICO® Score 8 based on TransUnion®  but it was 821 on 3/18, 6/18, 11/18, and 1/19.Chase: 800  VantageScore® 3.0 on TransUnion date (highest it's been on that credit card).Etc.\--------------------------------------------------------------**Financial Situation:**I have the cash to buy this car outright in full. However, I do believe it may be wiser to seek an auto loan. Tesla doesn't lease this model.I do have passive income of investment income of over $30k **a year** despite not having a job currently. I can prove to the banks that I have been getting paid month-to-month. It looks like regular income which they like). Tesla offers a minimum rate of 3.75%. They basically go to the big boys like Chase and Wells Fargo to get me a loan. The rate cannot dip below 3.75%, but the saleswoman said it can certainly go above that.Forget that.I believe with more score and financial situation I can get a loan as low as 2.5% interest rate (call me optimistic).\-----------------------------------------------------------------**My Questions:**1. Would it be wiser to put $30k down and get an auto loan for the rest or pay fully in cash?2. Will my credit score take a beating from going to multiple large banks and small credit unions to find an auto loan? (I'm hoping my shopping around for a car loan is the same as an auto loan   1. For home buying - major credit bureaus structure their rating systems to account for multiple inquiries within the same one-month reporting period. While there may still be a dip in your score, grouping your credit pulls will help you minimize the damage.3. I only bank and have credit cards with Chase, Citi, Discover, and Visa. Who do you recommend I go to in the D.C. area?4. How do I cold approach small banks/credit unions who I have no relationship with?5. What small banks and credit unions do you recommend in the D.C. area?6. Based on my situation - do you think they will put a clause in that I cannot repay the auto loan immediately? I will be basically showing them that I have the money to buy the car outright, but prefer an auto loan. They will like that, but will also see that I can squash their potential profits immediately.7. I have never gotten an auto loan before. Anything else you recommend?"
none,"I have been travelling the South by car for (6) months now to better understand my own country. I am a multiracial non-white man. One of the key questions I am trying to answer is if the South can heal their racist past and still be Southern? To go at another angle, is Southern pride inseparable from the South's racist past? To get specific, can a Southerner proudly sport the Confederate flag and not be a racist? A black tour guide today at Monticello (Thomas Jefferson's home) today told me flat out no. Racism and Southern culture is inseparable. He attended a speech by previous New Orleans mayor, Mike Landrieu, last night. This is the man who successfully took down Confederate statues despite death threats. He strongly suggested I visited the African American heritage center in Charlotsville today. I did. And my God it truly paints Jefferson and many white Virginian's in such a bad light. Monticello did a decent job at letting people know he was a slave owner. But that museum went further in the black struggle for basic education in the late 1800's and early 1900's in Virginia. Paying off the state's debt and making a labor force of second class citizens took precedence over providing a basic education for black children. Jefferson - one of our Founding Fathers - literally said he thinks blacks are subhumans who by virtue of their color and lack of intellect do not deserve an education. I'm tempted to say I don't care what that man accomplished. He did it on the backs of blacks. That's why math teachers ask you to show how you got to the right answer for a problem. You have the correct answer, but you might have arrived there the wrong way. The Declaration of Independence and Emancipation Proclamation are revolutionary documents. But it certainly doesn't erase the past. An open heart is needed despite the hate. Critical thinking in the grey is needed. The knots are deep and complex. It will take patience to unwind everything. It's a slippery slope. One must understand the white man's thinking that led him to treat black humans like chattel. Fear seems to be a central emotion I see. Fear of slave uprising. Fear of slaves holding office. Fear of slaves eloping with their white children. But what mental justifications and history of reasoning led to 10% of the population that did own slaves to convince the 90% that it was okay or at best to be bystanders to slavery back in the day? The question is one of healing, truth and reconciliation. How does the South get there? How do we get there as a nation without alienating white supporters and showing empathy to all sides? My thoughts so far:1. Training men (and women) that it is okay to express more emotions other than anger (or grief for women). This would be a massive cultural shift in the USA. 2. Teaching people (particularly white people) how to deal with shame, grief, and guilt so that they can enter the race conversation w/o running away from it and their emotions. I understand the Caucasian karmic baggage is too heavy for one person to carry. But a racial toolkit can help whites get in the conversation instead of run from it. 3. On a systematic level, encouraging and even pay for American students to travel the world and live in different cultures. If anything, this will clear up a lot of the ignorance in the South. But it also could be overwhelming for many who haven't even left their state. 4. Taking cross cultural communication, white privileged and other race courses.   1. Although I notice with many whites in the South, there is an attitude of ""I don't need to do this"" or ""It makes me too uncomfortable to learn about how people of my race has harmed yours."" Akin to when a child criticizes their parents. The parents are in control. They don't need to confront any flaws in themselves of change for the child. The child is there to obey. To be seen, but not heard and certainly not to be acted upon. An ego defense mechanism. But that's how quite a few whites in the South think from what I have observed and tested. They view the minorities as the children and they are the parent with the power. And beyond all this race is just a smokescreen that truly does choke people. However, the real problem I see in the USA is wealth inequality. That is why Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated before he organized the Poor People's March (Which today you would call Occupy Wall Street). That's beyond this post."
none,"**Claim**: White women have to fight two conflicting battles. As a gender, women are arguably gaining more power than at any other point in the last two millennia. However, by virtue of their skin color, they are the second most protected class in the USA. Just ask Emmett Till a short 64 years ago. Lots of progress has been made and there is still a long way to go. But how do you fight a battle for others than is in part against yourself? **More Background:** Black, Latino, Native American, etc women have nowhere to go but up. In that sense, they don't need to fight with a part of themselves on the path towards equality. There is far less inner conflict compared to white women. There is solidarity in that shared skin color oppression. However, white women must both gain power as a gender and use that privilege (skin and newfound gender power) to dismantle white supremacy. This will help other non-white women (and non-white men) succeed as well. They must speak up or risk being a bystander to white supremacy. We all have that duty as Americans. To stay quiet is to be a bystander. To stay quiet is to move with white supremacy and arguably support it through inaction. **Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust Survivor once wrote, ""The opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference.""**Sometimes the system of white supremacy is like watching some brown girl get beat up in the street by a gang of your friends. Are you just going to stand there, watch it happen and even film it? Or are you going to stop the beating? Would you stop the beating if it meant going against your peer group? Would you risk losing your power and status to do the right thing? What if you just got that power/status and worked hard to get it? What then? **Abraham Lincoln once said, ""Nearly all men (and women) can withstand adversity. But if you want to test a man's (woman's) character, give him (her) power.""**In a sense, they are like shamans - stuck between the spirit world (gender power increases) and the real world (current in/visible white systems of oppression that they silently benefit from will have to be dismantled to allow justice for all). They must manifest higher spiritual principles while dealing with being part of a Caucasian race that has oppressed (and arguably organized) dozens of indigenous cultures around the world. Why would someone give up their power (skin color privilege) when they just got this relatively new and increasing power (gender equality)? Full disclosure: I am not a white woman. I am a non-white man. Although I do wonder how progressive white women grapple with this paradox. It seems to be a balancing act that can turn to a slippery slope without lots of awareness, tact, and multicultural communication skills (which are not taught at any part of the US education system). "
none,"Hi all,This post is a bit complicated. It centers around if a woman should pay for a man's meal especially w/o first offering and what that implies. I feel odd about it in this situation because I believe this particular girl is a empathic manipulator. My conclusion is to move on and forget about it. I want a second opinion to make sure I'm seeing things correctly. Background:I met a younger woman touring a holistic medicine school. She is about to finish college. We were vibing pretty well on the tour. I could tell she was trying to impress me during the tour. A lot of touching my arm w/ a smile etc. I did notice my body instinctively moved away when she did that. When our tour was about to break - she invited the tour guide out with us to lunch. I was about to ask her. However, she had made it clear that she assumed her and I were eating out to lunch. Tour guide declines. We walk over together. No big deal.That first lunch goes well. I get her laughing. I find out she is an empath like me aka a big giver in relationships. She is also into yoga and other healing arts. She even writes down one of the funny things I said to her on her to-go box. She eventually asks for my number before we get the bill. She is a lot like me so I'm torn between treating her like a little sister or someone I am attracted to. I can tell she will have to take a lot of loans out for this school. So when the bills comes and the waiter asks for it to be split I tell him one check. My intention was 80% because you're like me and I feel your student loan struggle and 20% you're kinda cute. Not that that matters though.She thanks me and we walk back. It gets a little odd where she is suggesting we chill out then drops a bomb on me - ""The reason I kept going on the bathroom is because I'm on my period and XYZ I need to hang with my mom only for the week I'm here in the same town as you."" I'm like cool do you. No pressure. I really hope you succeed in life. In my head I also thought no need to make up an excuse. She suggested we hang out more today then backed out of it with this wild excuse. Could've just not suggested anything and said no in the first place. She gives me a big hug and tells me to hit her up when I'm at the next town she is in. Friendzone? I am not sure nor do I care. I'm just confused. Perhaps she is manipulative and needs to feel like she is the one in control for whatever reason? In some ways, I feel like I am looking into the mirror of my old self. Passive aggressive. Manipulative. But loving at the core. A good person can do bad things and still be a good person. Life is more often gray than black/white. As someone who has been on the giving end of so many co-dependent relationships, I feel for her. I understand her need to dominate and control when she has been treated so poorly. However, I also realize the ""victim"" (aka the old me and possibly her) are also to blame for that dynamic. We allowed it to happen. Fast Forward...I arrive in her town on Sunday afternoon. I shoot her a text letting her know I'm here. She texts back that she wished I came during spring break. She has a test on Wednesday, but gives me generic obvious advice on how to explore her town. Somewhat dismissive with a happy tone. Again I say I understand - hit me up if you need a study break. Next Day - Monday afternoon she invites me out to a spin class she runs for $5. I say I'm down. She then texts me asking if I like dogs. I say it depends on the dog and she says the dog is harmless, but can be timid depends on the person. Interesting she used my same language, but whatever. I park in front of her apartment. We walk through her campus. She greets this guy walking our opposite direction. He seemed less than enthusiastic. She then tells me that guy did some not-so-nice things to her friend. She didn't say hi out of spite. However, in my head I was thinking she totally did. That move was akin to Ariana Grande's ""Thank u, next"" classy clapback. You didn't need to make a song about it. You could've just ignored it and moved on. No need to be fake nice about your aggression for this random dude who hurt your friend like you are taking the high road for doing that. Just ignore. It was at this point I really started to think she was a manipulator. I can tell she is a strong woman because the gym receptionist didn't want to let a student in. She pushed through it and succeeded. I take her spin class. Never taken one before, but I crush it. She is giving me the looks the whole time. We then walk to pay for the yoga class in another building. She insists on paying for my class, but I pull out the cash and decline. On the way out she suggests we get dinner. I'm like cool. We get in there and she asks what I'm thinking of getting. She then goes to the cashier before me. **Main Problem**She then proceeds to sneakily pay for me. I had my card out expecting to pay then I see her bill is almost $30 and figure out what happened. I was exhausted having lost so much sweat. I would've caught it. Again I felt a little violated. Perhaps you could say this is how she felt when I insisted to pay for her 1st meal. However, we are in a culture where, on average, men are expected to do that. I could obviously tell she was attracted to me as well. Our food comes out. She gets a margarita. I don't drink alcohol and she knows that. But the whole conversation feels odd. I get her laughing a bit, but I see she is conflicted. She tells me I would get along with her dad a lot since we are so alike. And yet it is harder for me to get her to laugh. She then invites me to her apartment. Ahhh that's why you asked if I liked dogs earlier. I could tell at the first text, but I got confirmation. In the same breath she mentions some guy she is seeing who is in a band will come over at 9:30 p.m. I tell her I don't want to be there if she is seeing another man. She says she is only friends with him. He will just sleep over. Okay.... is she one of those girls that likes to friendzone guys to feel control over them based off some hurt in the past with men (her father/mother are divorced and she feels much closer to her mother)? Or perhaps she is lying about them being just friends? \----------------------------------------------------------------------She offers to let me shower in her apartment. I think that's odd, but whatever. I get some clean clothes from my car. She then lights some white sage/palo santo before I shower and makes sure everything is cool. Again I both do and do not see an opportunity to escalate sexually. I am in this woman's apartment. I don't want to be a creeper, but this is a weird situation. So I finish my shower. I put my hands out gesturing for her to put her hands in mine. The moment I touch her hands I feel hesitation in them. I then look into her eyes and ask if she is attracted to me. The room is bright. Her eyes are dilated. An unconscious sign of attraction. And yet she vehemently says we are just friends, but I even sense hesitation in her voice. I smile and say okay calmly. Her words say one thing and her body/voice says two different things. Confusing. But again I respect it. I am a man of honor. I am not here to take advantage of a woman in her own home. However, as a man I must at least make one overt move. She then sets up Netflix for me to watch while she studies. Now at dinner I even told her I didn't want to distract her from studying. I think this is some sort of power play. Her dog is skittish at first, but really warms up to me into the movie. She then asks random questions like - was that your first spin class? You actually did pretty damn well. Were you impressed at how much of that burrito I could eat? And other innocent questions where I could see she was struggling with being attracted to me. Towards the middle of the movie I put my keys in my pocket. Hearing that I am getting ready to leave, she moves into the living room with me to study. Again it feels like a subtle containment tactic. If you were really studying, why move from a table in another room (kitchen) to a chair in front of a TV during a loud action movie? She stops studying 20 minutes into sitting on that chair. We talk for a bit. She then starts to either act or be extremely tired. Then a knock comes at the door. It's her man. I shake his hand, hug her and then I'm on my way. It's been two days and neither of us have texted each other. I'm travelling so it doesn't matter.\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for reading this far! This was an odd situation where I felt like I was dealing with an emotionally manipulative woman who distrusted men due to her father's divorce with her mother. However, attraction to me as a man was going against her past hurts causing her to act in such indirect/passive aggressive manners as a means to take control back. I recognize that it probably wasn't anything personal against me. It was like watching an internal struggle. I have an Aunt like this. He divorced her mom. She didn't talk to him for 10 years. She told me herself. Extremely masculine woman that runs a construction company. Even goes to Alaska alone with men to go fishing. I'm no Mike Pence, but that's extreme in my view. She also publicly berates my grandfather for not being able to listen. She also says she ""whipped her husband"" into shape. Literally changed the man from a Republican to a Democrat lol. Nothing wrong with that. But goes to show how her initial hurt from her father causes her to act out against men as a means to control the man that originally hurt her. The little girl inside is crying. She must forgive him and herself to be free. I believe that struggle is what I experienced with this woman on these ""dates.""

none,"***Spiritual bypassing***\*, a term coined in the early 1980s by psychologist John Welwood, refers to the use of spiritual practices and beliefs to avoid dealingwith uncomfortable feelings, unresolved wounds, and fundamental emotional and psychological needs”.\*This may be a popular opinion already, but I do want to assert officially that it is impossible to suffer from Spiritual Bypassing if one practices Vipassana **properly**. Sensations arise, you observe the body's sensations, stay equanimous, and you move on to examine another part of your body the moment you feel the sensation. I am not familiar with spiritual practices that lead to spiritual bypassing. However, proper Vipassana is not one of them."
none,"I've learned a new term from a gentlemen I AirBnB'ed with in New Orleans - a quick serve restaurant. He owned a WingStop where you pay at the counter then they bring you your food. A bit slower than fast food, but not as slow as traditional sit down restaurants.In my travels through the South of the USA, I've encountered restaurants with fantastic interior decor, but...you pay/order at the front. Then they bring the food to your table. I find this odd. A step up from WingStop (better ambiance/furniture and standard plates/cutlery), but not quite traditional sit down were you're checked on by a single waiter/waitress. My question is - do you still tip? It's not a Teriyaki joint where you get your food in a takeout box and eat at a plastic table/chair - I receive it on a plate with metal cutlery on solid commercial restaurant furniture. However, I'm torn. Why should I tip service I haven't experienced yet? Let me know what you all think. "
none,"If so, do you still think that's a red flag?Situation: motor oil plug randomly pops on the highway. Low oil light. Smoking engine. Check engine. ABS light. Can't accelerate. Tow to Pep Boys. Engine needs to be completely replaced. But Pep Boys inspected my car twice three months ago?Challenge: mechanic asks me when I went and I said in Texas twice I forget exactly what dates/cities. Turns out the bugger was testing me. He looked through my glove compartment and had the receipts right in front of him. He gets super specific and says it looks like you got oil changed and a brake light replaced in XYZ and XYZ.” Screw you bro. You knew the answer and was testing if I was lying and was hinting at litigation. Well now I'm starting to think about it way after the fact. I get that monitoring the oil is on me, but this was a freak accident. He claimed no one could've predicted it. Internal motor damage. (He later claims that there was no oil, but my next 3k mile oil change was due in 500 miles...). However, I believe he was had it in his shop's best interest and the company as a whole not to take any liability. It just feels super shady...The Pep Boys mechanic then quotes me for (2) motors: $5.4k refurbished, no miles, 1 year warranty.$4.4k used, 120k miles no warrantyI find an honest mechanic who calls the second option bullocks (no warranty - seriously?) and the first way too high. She gives me $2.7k for a 60k mile motor from Japan. I'm left with this lingering feeling that I could've filed suit against Pep Boys and that dude invaded my privacy (glad I came to my senses and took my business elsewhere). Glad I don't keep my title in my car or this dude would've sold my car."
none,"Hi all, This is actually my first Reddit post after being a lurker since 2011! I recently left my corporate job to travel the US to find A. A new place to live and B. a more satisfying line of work. **Problem**: My movement has come to a halt when my 2010 Subaru Forester's engine (89,500 miles on the car - yes I biked to work a lot) went kaput today. Oil was leaking everywhere. I took it to Pep Boys. Well...almost. My oil light came on, then check engine light (insert smoke), and finally my ABS light. I could no longer accelerate. I tried to drift into Pep Boys after the exit, but failed. $24.99 to get a tow truck driver to make his record shortest haul - less than 500ft into the parking lot. **The verdict** was that I need a completely new engine (used, could be more than 90k miles, and has a 1 year warranty) or just replace parts of the engine to fix it (no warranty). I'm at a loss on how this happened. I've been replacing my oil (mostly at Pep Boys) every 3,000 miles. I've also replaced my battery at Pep Boys last October 26th and a tail light bulb at another Pep Boys in early November. I don't get how they didn't spot that. I have taken my car over city terrain/major highways since last September. I asked the mechanic at this Pep Boys and he got kinda sketched thinking I would blame them. **Questions:**1. Should I be blaming them for not checking it when I've asked them to check the car/change the oil in the past?  Is there any possible recourse if so? I am still baffled at how they didn't notice. 2. Thoughts on replace the whole engine or just the car? I haven't done my 90k miles work yet. 3. Insert Scenario - what if I planned to sell the car in the next two months and buy a new one? Would that change the answer to question 1? (Currently driving a Ford Impala, but the backsidAny advice would be much appreciated. Edit:Pep Boys options:$5k for a refurbished new engine with no miles - 1 year nationwide warranty $4k for a used engine with 120k miles - no warrantyNew engine can be in next Friday if they get it next Wednesday. Pep Boys cause and prevention thoughts:Freak accident that no one could've seen on inspection. Internal engine problems. Another poster pointed out their shady dealings and this dies sound like something shady someone who didn't want to take responsibility would say. Suggested solution from gallant posters:1. Tow it out of Pep Boys to another mechanic. At this point not sure if that mechanic can give me a better rate and to see if it was Pep Boys oversight. Not sure what I can do if it was Pep Boys fault. May need some more help here. *Note renting a 2018 Impala for $55 a day from Enterprise Rent-a-Car. That's an additional cost to think about in extending my timeline. 2. Don't replace the engine and sell the car....I've too much equity in it to do that I believe (21k gift brand new in 2009 - put in $4.5k for full body work last June, $500 for a major interior/exterior detail last August before I left, and then this $5k monster cost....still leaves me with $11k in equity plus selling it at $10k at least will offset those costs (I think I can sell for $11-$13k, but getting WA state to send me a new title to another East Coast state will be an interesting research adventure). Lessons learned:1. Oil light goes on - stop the bloody car and call a tow truck (my phone was at 11% w/ no charging cord when I first stopped to complicate matters...). 2. Monitoring oil levels is on me. 3. On extended drives oil levels can drop way more between the 3k mike checks than usual city driving. Always monitor. 4. See a slight leak - see a professional. Honestly folks - I think this is the good Lord's way of saying, Level up, homie!” I need to buy a new (used) car. Edit 2:Good news - I decided to call another mechanic. She said I was paying way too feeling much for the engine and $4.4k with no warranty is BS. She quoted me at $2.5k for a Japanese import engine with 60k miles and a 1 year warranty. Had the awk convo with Pep Boys. I claimed I couldn't get an advance from my credit card company for either option. Front desk person said okay I understand.  An hour later the mechanic called trying his best to keep my car in his shop. He almost wanted to buy the thing. Screams shady to me. Nice of him to cover the tow and oil plug/oil change, but I insisted upon paying the latter  b/c I didn't want their to be any bad blood.The new mechanics tow truck driver will pick it up tomorrow and I see this new mechanic in person to sign paperwork.Lesson learned:Always get quotes especially if your gut tells you Pep Boys workers are being shady and your car is in their garage. A tow truck can always come to take it. Another question I am going to ask the new mechanic:Can Pep Boys take paperwork out of my glove compartment?When I told Pep Boys that my car was inspected by them several times the mechanic got to my glove compartment. Next call I was going over where I got it checked. He said he found the receipts and was looking through them. Found that a bit invasive...I figure that is a mechanic either trying to protect the company for liability or his individual store. Shady though and another red flag."

none,"I like the potential and direction of the kit but I really don't like the preemptive nerfs to his passive, Q, and E. I feel like they were worried about maybe this rework causing him to run over top lane like in the past and did these to try to prevent it. With the nerfs to his passive, the increase cooldown on his Q, and the almost double to the amount of time you need out of combat before regening grey health, his W being primarily good for just engages, and his devour being such a long cooldown I think Tahm is actually in a worse state now  than before and really has no dueling power or damage to back up his aggression, often times he just jumps in and dies. I like the direction of the kit is good but his numbers are really really bad and he will probably be in his worst state yet until he is fixed, Tahm doesn't really have a place in the game if he doesn't have actual threat of damage and 1v1ing paired with his engage."

none,"A super close friend of mine has a really bad habit of finding a specific new person and then focusing so much on them with affection, flirting, attention, and care (and some manipulation) while also isolating them from their other friends so that it is just them until they build a dependence on them then when the relationship becomes too serious (they are scared of commitment), they meet a newer more exciting person, or they just get plain bored they drop them to the side entirely and practictically ignores their existence and neglects them. It horrible to the people he does this to because they wind up hurt or heartbroken or worse by them and it is bad for his previous friends because he treats them all more like aquatences that they mostly ignore because they are putting all their time in their new ""favorite."" This habit has gotten worse over time and they are leaving a long train of hurt people that they now don't treat like friends because it seems they only care about one person at a time now and it is more for their own amusement than for that person, usually getting them hurt. This is what he is doing to me and all my mutual friends and right now he is swapping to a new person who I am friends with who is sensative and has trust issues and might be permanently be damaged by this. I feel bad for my friend too because they don't want to treat us like this and it isn't intentional it is more of a side effect of their fear of commitment and obsession with meeting newer people and chasing them and when they are a good friend they are a really good one. So I'm not sure what to do, they have been kicked out of every previous friend group they have been in, everyone in the current one doesn't feel like they are friends with him and are getting to the edge of their rope so it sucks for them and my friend cause he might lose all of them although he does care about them (just has a serious problem right now), and it is awful for the newer people because my friends behavior has caused permanent emotional damage to them before and probably will again. I am torn I want my friend to get better because I want him to be able to hold onto friend but I also feel like I have to warn people about his behavior because it is super toxic. I don't want to just cut out the relationship because I think they have a serous problem it almost feels like an addiction how habitual and ingrained it is. They love making new friends but they are horrible at keeping the old ones. Any advice???"
none,"I have been friends with this individual for over 8 years now (it has been so long I don't know the exact time frame) but ever since I have known him there has been this weird cycle.To fully understand this I have to give some background on who this friend is as a person. Due to things in their past that I won't get into they find it nearly impossible to open up emotionally to anybody. We have been very close friends for a very long time and he still can't talk about how he is feeling to me 99% of the time and if they are ever confronted about behavior they are more likely to stone wall up completely and only respond with ""okay"" or ""I don't know what to say."" They do genuinely care about their friends they make a huge effort for them and like to meet a bunch of new people which can also have its own problems. They have  new friends of the month, they will meet somebody new and that will be their favorite for a time because it is exciting and he will treat them better than all their other friends until he meets a new favorite and swaps all his time investment to the new person and the longer he has known you for the worse he treats you. They enjoy occasional playful teasing which I do as well but the longer they have known you (with me especially) the less playful and more constant it feels. Every year we go through this cycle of us being on good terms and him being nice and a good friend to me, then he will start his usual playful teasing phase which will slowly become just constant abuse before I realize it and suddenly I am miserable and confront him on it, he makes a false promise to get better, and then we are back to ground zero with him being nice and the cycle repeats. I have always felt anyone is capable of change but this individual is the most unchanging same person I have ever met he is exactly the same person he is now that he was then just aged more, literally no difference.The ways he abuses me are constant rudeness and bullying, negging, gaslighting, always bringing me down when I am excited about something, and saying things like ""I hate you"" or ""gross/ew"" every time I show up. These are just some examples it really is just a constant bombardment of bullying if I am around him and he has reached that end point of the cycle. What is strange is despite how he treats me I feel like he does it because he cares about me so much. I have literally always been there for him and tried my best to be a good friend (I've made my own mistakes but I always sought to fix them when they happened) and he has opened up to me more than anybody else, I was the first person he talked to about an important family member passing, I was the one there for him during a time that he chased everyone away due to his behavior. In a weird way I feel like he treats me badly because he thinks (probably mostly subconsciously) that clipping my wings keeps me around and depended on him and also he doesn't like confronting past mistakes and I serve as a reminder of those. This is a silly comparison but as a frame of reference, if you have every watched Bojack Horseman, I feel like the Todd to his Bojack.I had the talk with him again and told him ""This has to stop or I'm gone"" and he had the usual ""I don't know how to respond but I'll stop"" response where he is trying to avoid conflict and I left it with telling him that I will give him time to figure out what he wants to say and how he wants to apologize but I do expect him to talk to me about this otherwise I have no confidence that things will get better, especially because this is a constant cycle and he just doesn't change. I care about our friendship and him and I don't feel like it is one sided I just feel like he doesn't know how to express it and has his own issues (that he probably needs to see a therapist for) because he does things that are genuine displays of friendship and how much he cares and wants me around and none of his behavior is a conscious effort to make me feel bad. I still don't feel confident that things will get better and he hasn't talked to me yet. I have some people that want me to give him a chance to change and some that think I should cut him off because I have given him enough chances so I don't know what to do. What makes it harder is we are both in a friend group that is very important to me, most the people in said friend group have been supportive of me in this and are not happy with how he has been treating me but they are still friendly and probably hang out with him more just because he is less busy than me. I am worried if I need to cut him out of my life if my friends would really support me in this or if they would choose the charming funny guy who buys them stuff over me even though he shows abusive behavior. I really don't know what to do and I could use some advice..."

none,I am hoping that Gwen's lackluster release really shines a light on how this game really just lacks any sort of AP bruiser or battlemage itemization. I am really hoping they do something about it. IMO they should have never removed RoA and should have either made it into a mythic or make it like a good first rush non-mythic for AP bruisers like how AD ones sometimes rush BotRK. Either way AP bruisers are struggling and the battlemage class basically doesn't exist anymore due entirely to the item rework and champ reworks.

I had a very poor undergraduate research experience where I was being heavily exploited (50 hour work weeks with no pay) but I had to stick with it because needed the experience and letters of recommendation. Basically I tried to leave that situation very respectfully, making sure to do all of my promised work and giving them ample heads up and time before I left but the professor still didn't like that I had to leave before the semester ended and does not like me anymore. At this point I already applied for PhD programs at various institutes and even got accepted for one. I have been going forward with accepting this position due to the fact that I don't want to reapply because I won't likely get more recommendations from this professor I worked with. At this point though I am realizing I might just much rather prefer to get a masters than a PhD and work in an industry job, however I am not sure if it was just my really poor undergraduate research experience that is putting me off of something I might really want to do. Is there a way I can enter a college under a PhD program and swap to a masters, I noticed they have the same coursework? I am not looking to scam the school out of tuition with this or anything I just don't want to miss my opportunity now that the door is open and I still might want to test the waters of a PhD program because it might be my bad volunteer lab that gave me cold feet not my own lack of interest.

I would like to see more Jarvan vs. Sylas in the lore, especially since I don't think they are really doing much with Jarvan..."
none,"I just wanted to see what you guys think of taking Fleet Footwork on Sy las after the upcoming nerfs? In its current state, I love this rune for helping me get through the early game, but I don't know if it is going to be worth taking anymore vs. other options especially since the needs was targeted against AP champs taking it."
none,"I am having some difficulties laning in mid with Swain, surprisingly with mages more than anything else which is a shock to me cause I feel like I would do good against them. The problem is how much more damage they do to me while also having more cc and a lot more range. So let me set up this scenario that I experience a lot. I am laning against a neeko I snag her with a perfect EWQ combo to hit her with all the damage I have, and I feel great about it then boom, she hits me with an E and a Q and then I lost the trade. Now replace that neeko with a lux or a xerath etc. I just feel like I am putting a lot of effort into playing Swain while any mage I face wins every trade as long as they hit a single ability while those abilities have longer range/are easier to hit while I hit all of mine. I am not really sure what to do about this I feel 1on1 I am being heavily outtraded by all artillery mages while also having to play way harder just to lose trades..."
none,"Hey I really enjoy Swain mid lane but when it comes to runes I kind of get choice paralysis as to what I want to use because there are a lot of options. Primarily I see people taking Conq, Electrocute, Dark Harvest, Phase Rush, or I have even seen Grasp and I wanted to know if you guys can help me understand in what matchups which rune choice is optimal and why?Also what about mythic choices? I see Liandries the most but new Everfrost also looks good and fun (not sure if it is worth picking up in the mid lane I haven't tried it). I tried Riftmaker and I'm not a fan, I felt so squishy using and like the damage was better with Liandries anyways, haven't tried it since the health changes but it still looks like a worse Liandries to me..."
none,"Right now I am playing an Oathbreaker Paladin with a really really cool backstory and an interesting thematic that I love. However, when I am playing them I find myself having no idea how, I don't know what to do with him in roleplay and I am starting to get really zoned out with what is happening. I also don't think I love playing the paladin class in combat, I love love love spellcasters more than any other type of class so I find the options I have as a paladin not nearly as fun. I am considering rerolling another character but I am hesitant because I don't want to miss out on a really cool character that I put a lot of work into I just don't know how to play, so I am not sure what to do? Please help!"
none,"Anyone think it is weird from a lore standpoint (not balance or build) that Qiyana doesn't do mostly magic damage??? She is the strongest elementalist mage in Ixaocan history but she is building duskblade in game? Feels weird to me that she is primarilary AD while Akali is all AP now when she is literally throwing knives and stabbing people while Qiyana is being the avatar. I kinda wish they had a way to include a 4th element to Qiyana, maybe you have Air or Fire when you don't take any other elements, and then she does mixed where two elements do physical and two elements do magic DMG?  I think it would be neat at least, I'm just spitballing."
none,We all know Ruby is the unofficial winner but it is exclusive so I am leaving it out to let the others have a fair chance...[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/lgbgmv)
none,"Is TK mid a playable thing? Tahm will always be my fave champ but toplane is toxic to play rn and I kinda wanna just go mid, after watching some clips of Tahm running midlaners down I wanted to know if this is really viable thing if you are good enough at Tahm? What would be some build and rune advice from anyone who has done it?"
none,"I just sort had a realization why not just build full tank? With the true damage passive, the % health missing ult, and the innate damage on sunfire you will still do pretty decent sustain dmg. The idea of the build is staying alive for longer to be able to easily kill and possess the carries on the enemy team and then blasting people with pure damage as those carries and getting ult resets. Since you get the items of the person you possess it doesn't really matter how you build as long as they have the ability to do damage YOU do damage even full tank. The major drawback is you are relying on the enemy to make up your damage with possessions but if they are so far behind that it isn't good to possess them then it isn't like they were gonna win anyways and you can at least help your team but getting cults off. So why not build tank?"
none,"After the nerfs to Goredrinker what do I build top lane? In not interested in Kraken Slayer because it is just too squishy but I really don't know what to build anymore, pls help!"
none,"Riot mentioned that the next champ being released after Viego is going to be a seamstress AP bruiser (likely Isolde). My concern is; how do they expect her to be played like an AP bruiser when they all about removed AP bruiser itemization from the game? Battlemages don't really exist anymore and are all build as either burst mages or supports and Riftmaker is the only AP bruiser mythic and it isn't that great of an item especially compared to the other two health+ AP items. I just feel like in a meta with insane burst, practically non-existent AP bruiser itemization, and where all semi-tanky ap champs are being built for burst or are struggling there is no way the AP bruiser they are adding will be played like one UNLESS they scaled off AD that converted to magic damage and that would be weird. Anyone else feel like she is probably going to be played like an AP assassin on release just for them to nerf her and then turn her into an assassin like they did with Sylas? That is what I am expecting to happen at least..."
none,The recent changes to riftmaker make me pretty excited because it seems to be promoting battlemages to exist once again. With the new sustain (that you get pretty early with leeching leer) and the AP values on it now how do you think this will impact the viability of bruiser Sylas top? Will Riftmaker be a new optimal item on him???
none,"I love Illaoi but I feel like I just can't play her in this season, damage is so high that no matter how far ahead I am I get one shot before I can even engage. I am resorting to building tank to just live but even then I struggle to stick to anyone or kill anyone withought being torn to shreds with the insane amounts of damage in the game rn, not to mention the fact that everyone can build a dash item or their own version of Steracks. I hate this item rework so much, am I alone?"
none,I am a Tahm main and back in season 8 I had a 70% winrate on him but right now nomatter how good I do I will still lose game. I could got 15/0 in lane and a fed Yone will one shot me and carry their team to win. Idk what is going on but I feel like the game is setting me up to lose with this character like they know that I am going to pick tahm top so they put me in worse matchmaking? Very suspicious! I wanted to know if this was a just me thing I bet I have like a 30% winrate on him by now.
none,Before the 11.2 tank mythic adjustment I was Sunfire all the way but now both Chemtank and Gauntlet sound good too and I'm not sure which one to build anymore? Also can someone explain the Divine Sunderer build to me it does not sound good in my head...
none,"Hello I made a post about a week back asking how I leave a lab gracefully even though it is super sudden. Basically to summarize I am an undergraduate researcher and this lab I am in was severely overworking me with no pay (talking like 40 hours a week) and prior to this semester I told them I would be remaining in that lab for this final semester. However, deeply personal circumstances happened (that I am not going to get into here and I didn't feel comfortable talking about it with my PI either) that put me in a troubling situation financially and I truly have no choice but to leave the lab to find a job to make money. I felt bad about the sudden notice but was hoping that they would understand especially since my project in the lab was winding down to a close anyways and the graduate student I work under would be totally capable (if not better off without having to guide me) to do it on his own and that I really have no choice in this matter. My graduate advisor understands and told me ""You gotta do what you gotta do"" but the PI is ""Very unimpressed by me breaking my promise and leaving after he wrote me a letter of recommendation"" (according to my advisor). I don't take that personally, he doesn't know the full extent of why I am leaving because it is too personal to divulge to him plus he was very much taking advantage of my labor with no pay. What I worry about is the future implications of burning the bridge with this PI who wrote me a letter of recommendation and who is also an Associate Dean at this research college and I could use some advice as to what to do, or if this will severely come back to bite me even though I really do not have a choice."
none,"Okay so I feel like Viego is in a really weird spot rn, he has a lot of damage potential but is often too squishy to pull it off, his early game can be pretty weak but he also gets oneshot late game, his W is kinda clunky and he relies A LOT on his passive ult resets. I feel the biggest problems with Viego is that he needs to have his identity solidified so these are the adjustments I would make: 1. Improve his scaling health. Viego is WAY to squishy for the amount of damage in the game rn especially for a melee character that doesn't have the best mobility and has sustain based on extended auto attack fights.  2. I would remove his crit scaling and have him scale off of AD better instead. Kraken Slayer is way too strong on him and I don't think this oneshotting assassin play style really fits his kit that well. In my mind he seems to be more like a skirmishing extended fight character based on how his kit works instead of a crit scaling Yasuo since he doesn't really have Yas' windwall or Yone's W/E to actually keep him alive. In fact his sustain is entirely based on extended fights meaning I feel like he should scale better off of building items like Trinity or Goredrinker but his AD scaling isn't as high as someone like Irelia or Fiora or Camille so he might survive more but his damage isn't anything compared to his crit build. I see a lot of people say he is meant to be an assassin but to me having the survivability and extended fight capable of getting multiple passive ult resets is MUCH more valuable and in theme to his kit than just jumping on the ADC and maybe oneshotting them. 3. His W definitely needs a buff or adjustment it is really strange to use, maybe let it go through minions? I am not sure what would be best for this but it needs something. 4. The Q's passive is great but the actual stab damage of it is a little weak. Along with having him be more of an AD skirmisher instead of a crit one I would improve the AD scaling/damage on his Q active. These are some ideas I have mostly I think a lot of Viego's problems just come from the fact that damage is absurdly high rn and he is really squishy with no real good way to actually make up for that. If he scaled better off items that would allow him to survive better into the game I think he would be less clunky and more consistent identity wise. He can be hard to play but I don't think he is SO hard that he warrants like a 44% winrate not even the most difficult champs have winrates that low. These are just ideas and opinions I am not expert and would love constructive feedback."
none,"With the impending item gutting in Aatrox I had a possible idea for a build that is so crazy it might just work. Now I know that Aatrox relies on his DMG to self heal so this isn't a FULL tank build more of a mix. With Goredrinker and Eclipse (now on PBE) both getting pretty big nerfs it is clear Riot is trying to remove Aatrox from the game by targeting his healing synergy with items so the goal is to have him rely less on his self healing and allow mitigation to fill in the gaps. I say with the recent changes to Chemtank it might actually be pretty good for Aatrox, it has decent mitigation, the active is strong on any champ, and it is fairly cheap so it won't take long for you to build damage after rushing it, it obviously isn't as strong as current Goredrinker but after the nerfs it might not be that far off. What do you think? I'm a pretty new Aatrox player so I am no expert but I don't see any reason why Aatrox couldn't make a tankier bruiser build work."
none,"I want to be good at Camille because she looks really fun and strong (also every champ I normally play is garbage, gutted, or not fun) but every time I play her I feel like I am feeding or way too squishy to do anything meanwhle when I am facing her she like destroys me before I can even react. How do I play this champion? I really need help."
none,I am a previous Tahm Kench/Illaoi main but with TK gutted (soon to be reworked) and Illaoi kind of suffering rn I am not really having fun playing anything and I need to branch out. I have played a bit of Aatrox but it was pretty hard and I didn't do great but it seems like he is a character I would like. What are the pros and cons of Aatrox and do you have any advice for someone just starting to get to know them?
none,This whole being forced to be an assassin because any other items suck on him is really lame. I just want to be able to fight people not just one-shot squishies after like 15 minutes of shit laning and minion clear...
none,"I want to start this out with saying that I love Viego and I am having a great time playing him but I keep falling into this same problem of getting ahead and carrying but not being actually able to close out the game because like one of my lanes lost hard and the enemy mid or bot or whatever just does way too much damage for me to even play the game anymore. As an example yesterday I had a game where I was 11/2 by 20 minutes but the enemy yone (who was behind all game) caught a lead by farming our bottom lane hard with like duo supports with him and wound up at like 6/5. We were destroying this game then the yone just sort of showed up and won despite being behind all game and I felt useless because even with my huge lead I just got one shotted almost every fight. For context I wasn't building super super squishy either I had Bork, Trinity, DD, and was building some defensive offensive mix. I know this is a team game and other lanes feeding can cause your lead to diminish but it seems like a common problem I have that I have a hard time actually ENDING games with my lead before the enemy just builds their damage (which I always say there is waaaay too much of in the game run) and then just win. I want to know if that seems to be a common weakness of Viego? Maybe because he is too squishy?"
none," I am having a really hard time playing the game at all rn cause the damage is so high it just feels like a chaotic mess. I am not even complaining about like specific classes or items ALL damage is too high from every source. Tanks hurt too much assassins hurt too much, mages hurt too much, the three playable adcs hurt to much, fuck it supports hurt too much. I am just really not enjoying the absurd amounts of burst in the game rn like it doesn't feel fun to me, am I alone?"
none,"In my opinion and based on Riot's balancing strategy, the simplicity of Sett's kit should mean he is a character who should hover at about a 50% winrate. The problem is that because Sett can play pretty much every role as a very good flex pick when he is strong he is being forced into a weaker state to prevent pro play abuse even though his relative strength and kit in his main role doesn't merit him having a 48% win rate. My question is what changes do you guys think they could make to allows Sett to be at a balanced 50% win rate in top lane and also not be flexed into every single role (maybe just one like Jung is fine but if Sett gets buffed he would get abused heavily in support again)? I don't think they are willing to allow Sett to actually be at a balanced state until they know he can't play every role effectively."
none,"He is intended for Jungle but is also a pretty decent top laner as well. Considering I think he is a pretty balanced release do you think Riot will be okay with him being in both the top lane and jungle? My worry is they are going to nerf him due to people not knowing the matchup even though I don't think he is busted and they might target his laneing because he isn't intended to go there, I feel like Riot typically let's double laneing slide when it is Jung and Top since Top can kind of be an island. It is when you get characters that can play all roles like Sett or can Mid and jungle like Sylas and Taliyah (they still refuse to nerf Ekko smh) that they seem to start gutting..."
none,Anyone experiment and see if the new items have brought back tank/bruiser Ekko. I used to play him a lot but kinda quit when I swapped off mid cause I have a hard time making him work in top lane. I remember liking playing a more sustain Ekko way back when and was curious if maybe it could be back but I haven't tried it yet myself?
none,"My least favorite season of league was Season 8. I disliked it so much that I took nearly a year break and came back halfway through season 9. Both seasons 9 and 10 had their own problems but for the most part I actually really enjoyed them. Season 11 is another beast though, I'm leaning towards taking a break again because the item rework feels absolutely awful. Most champs are forced to build the same thing every game, new items are either unfun overpowered or weak with no inbetween, and most of the champs I enjoy playing are doing awful (literally just Shen is doing good from my roster that is biased but still). I feel like they are going to spend this entire season and year trying to fix the mess they made with items just to give up towards the end and reverting most of it."
none,"For a very very long time now it seems like the entire subclass of mages known as battlemages have been steadily stripped of their identity and had the entirety of what made them a battlemage removed piece by piece. For example Ryze, who is still classified as a battlemage, lacks every aspect of actually being a battlemage besides the weakness of short range and is only viable because of his insane late game damage. A large portion of the battlemage subclass have been gutted, mini-reworked, or both to a point that very few even fit the category and even less are actually somewhat viable. The item rework and removal of RoD seems like the final nail in the coffin to me as battlemages seem to really lack good itemization. I think the entire subclass of battlemages has been removed from the game and characters like Swain, Vlad, Rumble, or Viktor are more like oddities than having their own subclass."
none,"Hi, I am quickly beginning to love Sylas, however, I am not much of a mid laner and I'm hesitant to swap to the new role just for this champ especially cause he has a rocky history of balancing. I wanted to know if top lane Sylas still works? I tried him and up there using Conquerer and it seemed like I did no damage while also being extremely squishy. If it does still work what would you recommend for Runes and Items? Also how are the matchups up there, is there anyone I should ban in particular or any good matchups to pick into?"
none,I am an avid lover of toplane Swain but right now it is really tough because it doesn't feel like he has a single matchup there that is actually in his favor. Even tanks that I used to do fine against just build one item and start outdamaging me and taking no damage from me. I really don't know what to do because it feels like I get counterpicked every single game by half the roster and even my good matchups are not in my favor due to new items...
none,"Hey I really really like Sylas thematically and his kit seems cool, fun, and right up my alley, but for some reason he just doesn't seem to ""click"" with me (top lane player). I feel often times that I am trying to do my best following strats I have seen really good Sylas' players follow but I never feel like I have the same impact as them. Even when I am doing alright and getting a decent amount of kills I wind up dying A LOT to a point where I feel kind of useless to the game while I have seen Sylas players absolutely demolish in similar situations I am in. I know it isn't fair to compare myself to people who play a lot of this champ since I am just learning but I feel like I am doing something wrong because he just is not coming together for me and I have no idea what and I really want to improve. Also I feel like I don't get enough healing on my W to ever stay alive even though I do believe I am using it right? I think part of the problem is I am trying to go him more bruiser and that doesn't work as well anymore and I should just be building him like a pure AP assassin, I just have a hard time playing squishy champs especially in the top lane since most of my characters are tanks or juggernauts..."
none,Hello I really like Lissandra but I was curious if anyone knows how to build her like a battlemage or if she can be built like a battlemage?
none,I am an avid MOBA fan and have played a lot of moba or moba adjacent games good and bad. One of the ones I just can't seem to get into is Data and I'm not even sure why? Any advice anyone has to like get more into Dota I would love to hear it cause the game LOOKS appealing to me.
none,"Hello I am an Senior at UT about to graduate with a Bachelor's in Science in Biochemistry with a 3.8 GPA. For the longest time I felt like I loved and really cared about science to the point that I wanted to dedicate my career to research. In order to achieve this I have been working as an undergraduate researcher in a lab for a little over year now and recently something has sent me into a spiral. Last week I presented to the head of our lab a small introduction of some research I was taking charge on and long story short he wasn't very impressed. His biggest criticism is it didn't seem like I had a very deep understanding of what I was doing with my project and in the lab as a whole for someone who has been there for a year (granted I was booted out for 6 months of that year because of covid) mostly just basic or surface information and he would honestly be right. I have been struggling to have any motivation to actually dig into the research I am doing or the lab to the point were I start loathing going in every day and I view essential things like reading scientific papers over what I am doing or plan to do as chores that I procrastinate on to a point where my lab advisor is getting onto me about it when I should be interested and excited into delving into the subject and this has been a problem since the very beginning of me joining the lab. I have this growing doubt that graduate school and research are not for me and I am kind of having a crisis about it because I know I really do love science and I've invested so much time and I feel stuck because I don't know what to do with my degree besides go into higher education (I am not interested in medical school). I don't know if I lost the spark for research, if I never had it, if I have been telling myself I am more interested into research because I don't know what else to do or what else I am good at, or if I am going through a weird bought of depression and imposter syndrome brought about by senioritis and pandemic mixed together. What I do know is I can't seem to invest myself into research despite my typical love for science and graduate school sounds like hell to me right now because this is just a small fraction of the responsibility and investment I need for that and I can't even manage that. I have been told many times that acquiring a PhD is a huge time and effort investment and I know that is true and so the way I am feeling now so close to graduating (I already sent out my PhD applications) makes me feel like I don't have the conviction for it. A huge part of me wants to just get my degree and start a career but I don't even know what I can do with a Biochemistry Bachlor's. At the same time I feel like I have a responsibility to my family and myself because of the opportunities I have been provided and because I am  privileged  enough to even get to where I am at now and I don't want to regret that. I could really use some advice right now of any kind I am really going through a whole gauntlet of emotions right now."
none,"So I have really been enjoying the new Riftmaker Akali build in the top lane rn because generally I love more sustain damage characters that stay in the fight longer than just pure burst and I wanna try something similar on Ekko with Riftmaker but the only problem is I have no idea what runes to take. Electrocute seems much better on a burst build and and Conquerer isn't easy to stack its healing is no longer very good so I'm not sure what would work better? I'm looking at Grasp, Fleet, and Phase rush rn but I would love to hear what you guys think would be optimal for an AP bruiser Ekko build! Thank you!"
none,I feel like a lot of the items are really good on her and she feels stronger to me rn than in season 10 so why is her winrate lower like significantly. Is it because of her matchups and the current meta?
none,"Flaming Sphere has bad synergy with the Wildfire Druid simply because of this text here: In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. If you have your wildfire spirit up you cannot control both the spirit and flaming sphere at the same time because it takes a bonus action to move the sphere and a bonus action to make your spirit do anything but take the dodge action. So you have to choose one or the other it just seems like really poor synergy compared to being able to cast a spell like fireball and control your spirit in the same round. Plus come on who doesn't want WILDFIRE Druid to have FIREBALL???"
none,This is literally unplayable rn :(
none,"I am starting to eye Wukong as a potential champion I might pick up but honestly I don't love Conqueror in general, it just isn't my playstyle, I usually like raidboss type champs like Swain or Illaoi. I feel like Grasp of the Undying could be pretty nutty on Wukong especially considering his passive, Q range, and ease at starting short trades with his E. I don't see a lot of people using grasp on Wukong, probably because Conq is so strong on him but I think a tankier raidboss Wukong could be totally workable. I wanted to see y'alls thoughts."
none,"I am kinda hoping with the upcoming rework to Tahm that they actually include a revert to a lot of the changes. If his Q doesn't stack passive, still consumes three stack, and his E is still gutted he will never return to his original glory and will always feel like a less fun Tahm to me if I am being honest. I don't think the first mini-rework was even necessary and that is what caused the endless chains of nerfs after Riot made him severely OP. I want to revert prior to the season 9 mess they made THEN swap W and R."
none,"With the ruined king game coming out soon, recent buffs, and additions to the resistance skinline that feature Illaoi in some of the splashart, I feel like riot is starting to pay attention to the kraken priestess again. Are you guys excited or worried now that it seems Riot hasn't forgotten about her? I am a little worried cause I actually like where she is balance wise and I don't wanna see her nerfed, especially if she becomes broken due to some new item synergies. At the same time I am really hoping to see some more skins, I still like her default look over all the other skins available right now, I think a cosmic/dark star Illaoi would be dope."
none,"I don't want to turn down the noise for any other character sounds but her's are just WAY too loud, can I mute them or turn them down at least without turning down the ability sounds of all champions? It is starting to give me a headache, and I might just start banning her so she stops raking my ears with her annoying voice. This is worse than spam pinging, please help me!"
none,"Regardless of like the counter matchup or anything I always struggle laneing against these three champs (Fiora especially) and I always cringe heavily when I see they are good in the meta (like they are now). What are some tips on laneing against them? With Jax and Darius I sometimes win sometimes lose but would love advice on them. However, Fiora feels like she wins lane no matter what and there is no counter play all you can do is farm under tower till late game. Please help! Usually I ban Fiora but when I play Illaoi I always save my ban for Trynd since on the rare chance he gets pick that is going to be a miserable time (I wish I had more bans)."
none,I totally don't mind his current look whatsoever but I am a huge sucker for skins that are canon to the lore of Runeterra and would love to see Yone's living look as a skin. Something similar in the vain of Young Ryze or Pre-void Kass but based on how he look for LoR. It would probably instantly become my favorite skin for him.
none,"I love Azir, I really want him to get out of this bad spot he is in and I honestly feel like this excuse from Riot that he is too problematic to buff or tweak is a complete excuse. There are way more problematic champions now I mean look at the recent releases Aphelios, Yone, Sett, Samira all balancing nightmares. I also feel that there are champions that are just allowed to be way too strong because riot likes them more, I mean Darius has been absurdly powerful for like nearly a season and a half now and he keeps getting indirect buffs to things like his jungle clear or ghost summoner and he is only getting stronger. At this point Riot's avoidance of Azir feels less justified as it being too difficult to fix and more like they have a clear bias against the emporer."
none,"This is just a fun post where I wanna hear everyone's ideas for a new Ryze passive not just complaining about the current one come preseason. Not accounting for the item changes, Ryze's passive is unique as he actually scales off mana which is fitting for a pure arcane mage like Ryze, but I was never a super huge fan cause it never felt super interactive to me just scaling, especially after the changes to his rune shield/movement speed buff. I have a couple ideas that I think would be fun.1. Ryze's passive is a rune buff where the more mana you spend continuously the more damage you do. This works as a stacking buff where every time you cast an ability that expends mana you aquire a stack or ""rune"" that increases the damage of consecutive mana costing abilities and acquiring a stack refreshes it. This buff has a really really short duration though, like half a second (not literally idk the balanced time) so you have to keep casting ultra fast combos to keep it up or it is gone. So the quicker you lay out you combos and the longer your combos go on the more damage you will do however this will burn through your mana like crazy and you have to really be on point on casting and hitting things to get the most out of it. Plus this could add a really cool visual flair where the more rune stacks you acquire the more your tattoos start to glow.2. I like the playstyle of the WoW arcane mage a lot and seeing that translated into league on Ryze would be cool. Where your rotations revolve around spending phases of using all you mana to go all out and blast the crap out of someone, then going into a conserving phase to get you mana back to do it all again.3. I also miss the shield, it doesn't need to be crazy like it was before but Ryze is supposed to be an up close battlemage but unlike someone like Vlad who can just constantly full heal he doesn't really have any sustain outside of his movement speed and phase rush which is pretty lame IMO. I think it is silly that there are characters Riot is fine with having crazy sustains like Sylas or Vlad that can constantly just full heal themselves in the middle of a fight and are impossible to kill (my god how the hell do I ever deal with Sylas besides just keeping him off me) but Ryze gets all the sustain gutted out of him. So a passive that has something to give him sustain like a shield scaling of mana expending, idk something would be nice since he is classified as a battlemage.4. Maybe something that involves him actively collecting world runes on the map? I quite literally have no idea how to implement this and it would probably be pretty gimmicky but it would be super cool to see the world runes in the game and have Ryze interact with them in some way.I would love to hear everyone's ideas for passive reworks or thoughts on mine. This isn't a super serious post or me complaining I just find theory crafting fun!"
none,"I love Illaoi, she is one of my most played champions, but I quit top lane. Right now with the emergence of Jax and Fiora being high tier, the lack of control you have over the game and your lane (90% of my top games are determined by the jungle), and the counter pick meta I really just don't find top lane fun anymore, all the things I used to like about it seems to be gone at least for me. So I swapped to mid lane and I'm learning that role rn along with a new champion pool. I wanted to see if I could make Illaoi work in mid because I really really don't want to give her up but I'm just not willing to return to top. What do you guys think, is there a way to make her work???"
none,"I'm learning to play Ryze rn and I'm really loving him despite him not being at his former glory I love the thematics of a pure arcane rune mage. However, I'm never sure who to ban in both top or mid?"
none,"I really like the look and feel of Galios kit as I am used to playing juggernauts and tanks in the top lane, that is just what I enjoy. Then I look at how Galio actually performs in the game and I am extremely confused as he is built like a burst mage in mid. It is strange to me because he seems to be designed like an anti-magic tank and his lore fits that description quite well as he is a huge statue that absorbs magic, but in game he fits the same role as Kassadin which feels so awkward and confusing to me. I'm not saying he shouldn't be allowed to be played in the mid lane or have a burst build I mean look at Malphite, I am just saying that it is strange that is pretty much the only way he is played and it makes me feel like Riot has completely given up or just never really cared about his character identity. What would you guys think about them making his tanking more viable just for like another play style that makes sense for what Galio is? I also wouldn't mind a good anti-magic tank up top lane as there are a lot of champs up there like Vlad or Mord that go kinda unchecked and anytime somebody picks AP top picking and building against them becomes very hard to do ESPECIALLY with Vlad he is just too safe."
none,"I've been thinking about it and I think toplane would be a pretty great lane for Yone. Hear me out, he has amazing initiation for a top leaner with his E, he has about as squishy as Riven or Fiora, his E's true damage is really good against Tanks and Juggernauts, and his magic damage on his passive makes him harder to build against when it comes to Tanks and Juggernauts too."
none,"It is really fun I can honestly say I think I enjoy it more than the main gamemode, I really hope it stays for good, what do y'all think?"
none,I feel like she is pretty good and I haven't really been having poor games with her whatsoever. I didn't think she would be a champ to be so hard and have such a high skill curve cause she seemed pretty easy to pick up as long as you know to utilize her ms buffs? I am kinda genuinely confused by how low it actually is???
none,"I am not usually fond of champs like Lillia, my tastes seem to usually lean towards tanks or juggernauts (I mean my main was Tahm Kench for awhile) but I can't help but have so much fun with Lillia I mean the most fun I have had in league in a long time. Right now I have been taking Phase Rush then running Rod of Ages/Liandry's torment in the top lane (my usual lane) and I am doing alright but I am curious what people think would be optimal for her up there with both runes and items, I can't help but feel she could be optimized more. What do y'all think?"
none,"I took a couple hours with my crew to have them read all 5 journals for the Cursed Rogue quest because they want the Order of Souls Eye Curse, after traveling to all the islands and reading every journal they are not being counted on their commendation page, I wanna know how to fix this instead of wasting another couple of hours going from island to island to find them and read them again just for them to not be counted again..."
none,"I typically like to build a character around their class as to better flesh out an explanation on their abilities as well as determine the play style I want as well, that is just sort of my style of character creation (typically I have broken this rule before.)Mechanically I love the monk, they are so extremely fun to play and the flavor is super unique and cool! However, I am a very roleplay centered player and I run into a problem a lot when it comes to trying to make monk characters because they often feel very samey to me or it is hard to make them different from the inspiration they come from. This is why I am stuck rn I am trying to make a Four Elements monk (using a remastered homebrew edition) but I don't just want to make the Avatar and I also don't want to make another standard monastery guy who maybe left to explore or got kicked out I have already done that and I want something more fresh that also delves into the elemental powers of my monk.Got any unique and cool elemental monk background/character ideas I would love to hear them?!"
none,"I first wanna say that ever since Gigantic died I have been looking for a game to fill that hole that it left in me because I really really love this style of hero fighter/shooter/moba mix of game or whatever you wanna call it. However, I have endlessly been hurt by trying to invest time in these games that sadly do not seem to stick around for long.I want to buy this game but I guess I am worried because the peak steam players today was like 25 people and I don't wanna invest on another game and grow to love it just to watch it fall and break my heart AGAIN (like gigantic). So I guess I was hoping I could get player input on hope for the longevity of the game or a way that it won't flop so I can feel comfortable getting it without having my dreams crushed yet again by the current game market."
none,"I play top Voli and I keep seeing Press the Attack being picked up, I guess I don't see the synergy because I don't understand why, can anyone explain the build to me???"
none,"I don't really like the W it just kinda feels weird to set up and use, I guess I just don't see the point of have the first proc it just feels bad ESPECIALLY in teamfights. I kinda just want to increase the cooldown and have it be the like 2nd proc of the ability or maybe just it be the original ability idk. Besides that I love him he is super super fun although his downsides are not really made up for by his mobility or sustain, hopefully the buffs will be enough to make him fine."
none,"So I am making a fun character using Old Gus' Pooka race and Faerie class (if you haven't checked out Old Gus' Errata pls do it is my favorite series of homebrew content lots of cool stuff).Basically my character is a mischevious half-fae creature inspired by the Scottish Cait Sith myth. Part of the Pooka race's culture and something I want to include in my character is they have a strong compulsion to lie often. This can be made to trick people but culturally lying is its own form of language and expression through which the Pooka form strong bonds and relationships with those that know them well enough to discern their lies from their truths. In that vein I want to play a character who lies a lot but more so in harmless mischievous ways to poke fun with and entertain the party rather than make them upset or flat out trick them in a mean spirited way. Trouble is that I am worried of having my character just be an obnoxious liar that nobody in the party likes or trusts or that ruins story hooks by lying to NPCs. My question is how do I play a character who compulsively lies, in non-mean spirited ways, without it negatively affecting our party or making the rest of the group hate my character?"
none,"The short rest recovery turns warlocks into an endurance style spellcaster that is super unique and interesting however I think it is far too situational and can make them feel very unrewarding and repetitive mechanically which is a shame considering I think they are the coolest class for roleplay. Ideally warlocks thrive in dungeons with multiple instances of combat and time inbetween to recover however that isn't always possible as you could be in a time sensitive situation, your party could be really stubborn about not wasting time, your DM could be super restrictive on short rests, or even just some dungeons can be all one combat or very few. My argument isn't that the short rest recovery isn't functional or viable just that it isn't super fun and a lot of warlocks I see get bored very fast of being stuck in combats with nothing to do but eldritch blast but I think I have a way to keep them as a brawly caster with good spell slot endurance and have it be much more active in combat but I want to hear what others thought.My idea is this: Remove the short rest recovery or possibly nerf it (it may not even be necessary to remove I just don't want to make the warlocks OP) then have a rule where in combat a warlock is capable of impressing their patron to be gifted back expended spell slots. For example, ""The critical hit you scoured on that kobold with your eldritch blast greatly impressed your patron who gifts you a portion of their power for your continued loyality and skill, you regain one spell slot."" This could be a strict rule of something you specifically must do to recover them like maybe ciritical hits or on the DMs discretion and flavored for your patron like maybe doing something chaotic makes your archfey patron happy as an example. The goal of this is to give warlocks more active gameplay in recovering their spell slots as well as giving them motivation to be creative in their decisions and to mix in using their eldritch blast with their spell slots as their patron could always be watching. I also think it is cool that you could specifically flavor it for each patron and backstory so having and better understanding of your patron and and closer relationship with them means you have a better idea of what you can do to be granted their blessing playing even more to their charisma casting style. I just want warlocks to be more active in combat because I think it is a shame that such a cool class roleplay wise can be kind of one note and be reduced to begging for short rests from their DM and their party like they are the real patrons they are forced to serve. What do y'all think?"
none,"I am swapping over from mainly playing DPS to Tank, mostly because I find the role a lot more satisfying and Sigma is probably the best hero in my roster. However, I don't really wanna be a Sigma one trick only but with my limited time in the role I have yet to feel like any other tank has really clicked yet. For somebody who really loves playing Sigma what other tanks would you say are similar enough that I would enjoy them and their playstyle?TLDR: What other tanks are similar to Sigma that a one-trick would like them?"
none,This isn't a like OP pls nerf thread I think balance wise Fiora is fine. My main problem is Fiora decks imo are really unfun to play against and as because either way I never feel satisfied. Winning while playing Fiora never feels deserved to me and losing against Fiora just feels like a waste of time. Am I alone on this? I kind of just want to gauge people's thoughts in general.
none,Lets make it so that happens in game again too!!!
none,"I really really miss Tahm Kench Top, he was my favorite champions but they have changed him so much it is really hard to play and not just feel like something is missing... What do you guys think needs to be done to make Tahm Kench top fun and viable again???"
none,"Where do you think he will work best out of Jung? I think a mid burst Fiddle could work alright although with a weaker early game, but I think his top lane would actually be pretty good, plus he can use his fears and effigies much better in the top lane."
none,I like the cool skill expression in Fiddle's new kit but I can already tell all of it is going to go right out the window when he is built burst and all he does is gib people from brush with his ult or just hits Q twice on an enemy. Honestly I think he would be more fun and his skill expression would matter more if he was more of a sustain mage/bruiser similar to swain over a burst mage.
none,He isn't like anywhere near as oppressive or as strong as he was on release but yet he is still banned in like 90% of my games. Why? Do people just not read patch notes? I was hoping after the nerfs I would finally be able to reliably play The Boss but doesn't seem that will be happening anytime soon.
none,"I love Ekko, he was my very first main, but I don't love mid lane and I am more of a bruiser/juggernaut kind of player. I was wondering if the new Conqueror works on Ekko because in my head it doesn't sound bad at all and even AP assassin champs in the same vain as Ekko like Sylas take it to great success. I don't see anyone running it and the closest equivalent I can find is a Grasp Ekko build that is fun but definitely makes you lose out on damage a little more than I like. Any toplane Ekko builds you guys would recommend?"
none,"I wanted to hear general arguments you guys had for which one is better?Personally I have been building BC over Trinity because I feel like although Trinity gives you a much bigger power spike than BC once you build it, I always feel like the cost to get there really hurts and come late game I feel much weaker with Trinity than BC. Not to mention typically I will dip into a Hydra build if I plan to take Trinity which puts even more money in the hole and by the end of the game I feel squishier and like I am dealing less damage than if I built BC and Sterack's for my first two items. It might just be a play style preference but I always feel like I am making way more of an impact and I have way more staying power with BC. Like Trinity + Hydra Build makes you Bruiser Sett while BC + Sterack's Build makes you Juggernaut Sett. I am thinking about trying Trinity build again now with the Hydra buffs but before this point I personally never felt Hydra was necessary for Sett to clear or have lane priority and come late game it was way less useful than investing in health or tankyness but with the changes maybe I will come around to it more."
none,"I recently started playing Illaoi so I am no expert on this and generally I made this topic to just see some debate on these changes. Often, when I play Illaoi, I have this gameplay fantasy of getting into the middle of a teamfight and being this big tanky brawler slamming people with tentacles left and right. In practice I just feel like a lane bully that relies entirely on hitting one, very easily dodged, skillshot, then when those teamfights do come around what usually happens is everyone dies if I'm lucky and I get a good ult, or more likely, I get one or two slams in before the mage or ADC generally one shot me if I can even get into the team fight without getting heavily kited to begin with. It feels like Illaoi turns into this ""I know I am going to die but I am going to try to take as many of the enemy out with me as possible"" kind of champion that just doesn't fulfill the champion fantasy that at least I want from her at all. I think the problem stems from her just being very squishy compared to other juggernauts while her tentacles don't really give here enough sustain to compensate for that squishyness in the first place, at least not in most scenarios. You could always just increase the healing on her tentacles but I don't really enjoy drain tank Illaoi because it relies heavily on situational positioning and hard to hit skillshots which might be an appeal to some but generally might contribute to the problem of Illaoi just not feeling like a juggernaut half the time, again at least not to me. I feel like Illaoi needs better base stats to make her actually tanky to some degree, and to compensate for those better base stats I would like to see her power better redistributed throughout her kit but also having her damage reduced. That way she relies more on staying in the fight for extended trades instead of flash ulting and hoping to one shot the carry before she dies. Personally I would love to see here have a way to stick to the target like maybe a movement speed buff on her W or a way to keep them from just leaving maybe a stronger slow on the initial hit of her E. I really want to hear what you guys think, again I am not an expert at all on Illaoi I just feel like there is a huge difference between her character and play style fantasy and how she actually optimally plays in game to the point where I struggle to call her a Juggernaut sometimes because she just doesn't feel like it to me a lot of the times when I play her, and though I still have fun with her and like her a lot I am very often left disappointed because I see more potential in her design than what we have in game. I also feel like redistributing her kit power would make her way less frustrating to play against in lane.Edit: I also would like to reiterate that this isn't me claiming Illaoi is weak or strong or whatever, just that I don't think she fulfills the play style I want from her. Also I do realize I can build tanky still and I do sometimes I just don't think her current stats benefit from that very much."
none,"I wanted your opinion on which rune you prefer? I typically see people taking Conq on her but in game it feels very hit or miss because stacking it is dependent on your tentacles hitting consistently in every fight which doesn't always happen, where Grasp can be hit reliably with her W in every fight. I'm not sure which is stronger to be honest I remember on release I had pretty good success with Grasp on her and consistently became a raid boss for the enemy team, now that I am getting back into playing her I am not sure what is better?"
none,"I feel like no matter how well I do, like I could be going 12/0 or something ridiculous, I feel like if the enemy adc gets ahead even slightly the game is over, he is just way too easy to kite (also adc's and bottom lane priority is way too strong imo), I feel like he needs a buff to his movement speed, or maybe make his Q just a flat movement speed buff rather than just towards enemies like Garen, if they ever want him to be a meta pick. For now though I really love playing him whether I win or lose and I have been looking for a champ like that ever since they killed my old main Tahm so I am pretty happy atm."
none,"Cowards!!!In all honesty though, it seems like a waste of a ban, there are much more op champion selections rn people just don't seem to want to learn how to play against him. I for one would rather fight a million Setts than one Fiora or Akali."
none,"I know with the rework he is in a strange place currently but I really wanna learn him but find myself in a position where I either stomp or get stomped often and I feel like there is more I could do to improve but I have a hard time analyzing what to work on because he is so new to me, so I just wanted any tips or advice y'all might have to improving as Sylas so I can gain more wins and learn to carry better as him. Currently I have been picking him mid just because I have been trying to seperate myself from top lane because it is in a horrible spot rn, but I have mained top for a long time now and kinda always end up back there so I might just end up taking him back with me."
none,"I am kinda new to playing Sylas so I know the intention for the whole ""You have to wait some time to ult the same champion twice"" was because his cooldown in the late game on his ult was super low so that he could use multiple ults in one team fight, but riot wanted to force you to use different ones, but that literally has never happened in a game I played of him, idk if they increased the cooldown of his ult since release but if they did, what is the point of this? It is kinda just another handicap he has for no reason and makes his lane phase worse, when it is already horrible, since post 6 most fights your lane opponent has an ult and you don't. Like what is the point of it if you can't get two ults in a single teamfight anyways????"
none,"You might as well remake the description to ""Press Button to Gain 1 Passive Stack"", the slow is lackluster, it does no damage even in the late game, and it can't even be used to clear waves effectively. Meanwhile his E does INSANE damage,  so like your overall damage output doesn't feel less but it does feel like you only have 3 abilities (one of which is actually someone else's ability) and it's clunky and weird. I don't hate the rework because I feel like he did need one cause their balance changes in attempt to remove him from the jungle REALLY messed up his kit but I don't think they learned from their mistake and tried to go 15 different directions with this rework. Nerfing his q damage but buffing his e damage while removing his e shield but increasing the w heal while also increasing the w mana cost ect. ect. ect. What do you want Sylas to be? A sustain baised AP bruiser? An AP assassin? A tank? A mage? I have no clue?! In my opinion Sylas' core kit works best mechanically with an AP bruiser type playstyle and I wish Riot would just solidify an identity for Sylas in game and then give him a proper rework because this isn't it."
none,"Honestly this is a super short post because Kench really doesn't need a lot to be balanced again all it would take is 2 steps.Step 1. Revert all the season 9 changes, On-hit AA speed Kench is either overpowered or underpowered and he is a nightmare to balance, not to mention his kit and play-style become extremely simple and boring where all you do is spam tongue lashes and auto-attacks the ENTIRE game that is lame, boring, and the catfish is above such face rolling gameplay. % health damage W Kench was clearly superior even if it was weaker because it made our boy way more fun and interesting as well as skillful to use, knowing how to correctly manage your cooldowns and when to devour is what differentiate gods and men on Kench and it truly made you feel like a big ass catfish ready to go to town.Step 2. Remove ally devour, I know I know, this would likely kill Kench support but honestly Kench needs to focus on one lane and the ally devour is far too much utility to ever be balanced in pro play which is what got us into this mess in the first place, we can't ask Riot to not balance around pro-play because that is unreasonable so as long as it exists our boy is going to be benched. If this makes Tahm too weak then they could add a compensation buff to Kench, I personally wouldn't mind some more cc especially since your ult is almost primarily utility, I think it would be a cool and fun flavor that after you spit up an enemy from devour they have a fear applied to them for a short time, this would make Tahm more useful in team fights since he will be lacking his free zhonya's and the added cc might make his supporting still pretty alright. There is a good chance that might be too strong so it isn't needed I just thought that would be a fun little addition to the ability and would add to the whole I am a giant catfish demon here to devour your soul feeling you get when playing Tahm which is always fun. (Another fun idea is if enemies that were devoured had an armor debuff when they are spit out because you know stomach acid you could even have a cool nasty slime effect on the enemy but I recognize that this could be way overpowered)I think this would make Kench a pretty healthy top tank and maybe the best tank option to counter other tanks which I think would be a good niche to fill in the game especially since Bruisers (which are supposed to be anti-tanks) are just kind of glorified chunky assassins right now. Tell me what you guys think? I really don't wanna ruin the fun for Tahm support mains I just feel if Riot doesn't focus him on a lane he will be stuck in this limbo and his supporting is way harder to balance than his top lane ability, plus I am biased because I am a Top Kench main."
none,"Every overturned flashy champion (typically the ones that are deservedly nerfed because their kits are just TOO rewarding for the level of play pros are capable of aka Yasuo, Riven, Ekko, Pyke, Zed, ect.) is buffed into oblivion so that Riot can get footage of flashy plays turning the entire game into a complete unfun cluster fuck and any champion that counters this one shot flashy combo filled meta (Tahm Kench) gets nerfed to complete uselessness so that pro players aren't allowed to play intelligently and the only way to counter all the champions is to just nerf them, but there are WAAAAAAY to many that are nerf or lose. This game is completely unplayable every time Worlds comes along and I think the most ironic thing of all is I really don't know many players at all that actually care about competitive league, in fact I know way more that outwardly refuse to watch it because Riot's favoritism for it ruins the game every year. I'm hoping when it is over, our boy Tahm gets a deserved and well done rework or just a revert back to his Season 8 days..."

none,So I mixed a batch of rosin in mct oil I put 4.2 grams of rosin per 25-30ml of MCT oil.   Which is is about 15% rosin I'm estimating very roughly 10% THC content. Anyway I want to make sure its properly decarboxylated.  It had some heat on the pressing plates but only for 3 mins or so. Should I have decarbed the rosin on its own before mixing with the MCT? (For next time)Its mixed now so for this batch I let the glass jars sit on the over range glass top on the warmer setting.I let them sit there for about 2-3 hours shaking them up every 20-30 mins. I don't have a temp gun to check the twmp.on the warming range but it gets hot. Too hot to touch without burning hand. Bur I'm wondering if it needs more heat. I feel like it only got the oil to around 90c maybe. As a guess. Do I need to add more heat for awhile to be sure to get best effects?  This is for medical use for a friend. So I want to be sure..

none,"Currently on 2mg. From the original 4mg subscribed. Stable, but I find after 6 months or more at a dose It tends to start not working as well, which is part of why I wan to go back to an SSRI.Last time I tried to quit i tapered down to 0.5mg (first 1.5 then 1, then 0.5 with a month+ between steps). It was not terrible until 0.5.At 0.5 I was not able to stabilize.  If anything it seemed to be getting worse at the 3 week mark... Maybe it was just in my head that i felt like I should be getting better...Anyway I failed that taper.Considering where I live we have only pills no strips available, I thought it was going to be tough to break my pill beyond 0.5mg anyway. (1/4 pill) I do not have access to any clinics or special sub docs.  My doctor said and I quote ""it shouldn't be harder than any other antidepressant to stop using"" That's completely untrue for me. He's a been a great doctor otherwise just doesn't seem to know alot about subs.How should I prepare for me next taper?(Any additional meds and or clues as to how to divide my meds?)And should I start the SSRI while still on suboxone, maybe once I'm down to 0.5?Any advice is welcome."

Ita not only crypto markets, it's our lives.  In order to give proper advice a person needs to understand alot more than Any internet Anon could.The decisions we make here might effect future generations.  Maybe I have part of my kids education savings in Crypto.  Maybe I just added X amount last week in hopes of a quick 15% flip this week.  Maybe I've been holding Doge since it was 1 cent.. and I don't really need any of this money.  Maybe I just bought ETH for a long hold thinking it was the safest investment.  Maybe I just YOLOed in in some stupid dog coin.  All of our individual plans and needs are different.Think of your long term plan, don't let any internet noise unduly influence your decisions."
none,I keep seeing big write ups that go on and on obsessively analyzing every silly whim of a Twitter  post made by some stranger. It's getting to ex president Q anon levels and we are better than this.  The only way that it matters is of we choose to let it by analyzing every fart and sneeze this stranger makes. He is nothing but 0.0001% of the total crypto net worth.Chill and let's talk about actually important topics.
none,"Hi there. I'm a father of a 7 and a 2 year old.  I've got a savings account for both and I want to soon invest I've got a good chunk in each.  What coin would you all consider the safest bet for long term holding which I can also stake?  I'm thinking maybe ETH, ADA ALGO, SOL.?  What do you guys think? I won't be touching this for about 15 years.  It's not for school specifically but it may be.  Who know by that time maybe post secondary education will be a public service like in many developing European countries."
none,"Coins like ADA and ALGO there is an option to claim the amount of your reward.   With solana, there is no option for this, and it does not show any accumulated amount that I have gained.    So I claim the rewards by unstaking???"
none,But I can not find a way to stake it...
none,I noticed Solana says 11+% APY.  So I bought some.  But theres no badge like with Algo or ADA.  and Solana does not appear in rewards section.    Whats up?
none,"So I seem to read in every other sub comments that degrade in to how terrible home prices are in Ontario and BC in particular and mostly all of Canada.   I'm not here to argue, of course there is huge inflation going on and that mixed with foreigners coming here (I don't blame them) makes for insane increases in home value.   Toronto and any other major city is nuts.  But let's take a look elsewhere.  I'm going to run with Ontario as that's what I know.  Here's a list of reasonable (hasn't seen the crazy inflation and 20% over asking buys etc)  cities and town in my area:Owen Sound, WiartonPort elginHanoverWalkerton ListowelGoderich WeAll these towns are basically within a 40 min commute to bruce power, the largest nurse generating station on the planet (as of a few years ago anyway)Also besides bruce power the entire area seems strapped for employees from my experience.  Getting a job is very achievable, and even a well paid one. You can easily get a lower paying job but mid tier jobs such as trades people, nurses and support workers are in supply.  Populations here are low and consist of a higher percentage of retired people I do believe as many people choose to retire in lower COL areas. In any of these small cities or big towns I listed you have usually a 10 min drive to your local Walmart, a dozen fast food places and even more nice restaurants, lots of other local shopping parks, theatres etc.  Due to the lowe COL my wife and I were able to buy a house a decade ago and lay off our 25 year mortgage in 8.5 years.  (She had a lower paying cook position, and I worker as a carpenter then got in to other lower paying work that I enjoyed more, again due to lower COL I was able to have the freedom to choose a lower paying job that brought me more satisfaction)Anyway just wanted to say, canada Is a huge place.There are many small and medium size towns that offer 80% of the luxaries of cities and a much lower COL and houseing prices. (Grab a decent 4 bedroom home in this area for 350k maybe atm)"
none,I really enjoy having the ultra wide it makes games so immersive. I wish stadia would support it.  Why do most of games support this but not stadia?
none,Looking to switch from eth.   Is there a web page or app I can use for mining raven?
none,"Every other report I have read from any 3060 ti card has been 60+ mh for mining ETH.I'm using msi afterburner to get from 35 to 38/39But this is weak.  What. Gives?  I know dell computers run hot, and I was prepared to take a small hit on MH or gpu temp or both.  But this is 40% less than it should be. the temps are only 63c on gpu, that's in a Decent range.   It just won't get high MH rate. Is there some sort of limiter that dell has somehow imposed on its cards?.Why did I pay extra for this card that gets the same as a card half it's cost?"
none,I have 20 years experience immersed in cannabis culture (as I am sure many of you also do). I am able to identify different terpens and their potential effects.  I say this only to demonstrate that I can be an effective bud tender. I also have customer service experience.  Minimum wage in ontario is $14 an hour.  I hope that it will be a fun job.  I have been passionate about cannabis for 20 years and it was a great day when we legalized it.What do you guys think?
none,"I read a fair bit here about peoples happiness about their crypto accounts.  I share in your happiness.  However I do ant to remind some that when we have XXXX$ value in our crypto accounts, this is actually similar to Stocks.  Until we change it back to cash, It is not cash.  Yes you can spend BTC on things and ETH is a utility of sorts.  But its not cash.   At any time any of these cryptos could fall any amount in value.    I hold ADA, ETH, TRON, ALGO, SOL and a few others.  I hope they appreciate and that I can trade them in for spendable assets one day, (wether thats cash or another crypto that I can spend, etc)  But It I would be jumping the gun to say that I 'have' this cash atm.  If my logic does not hold up, please fill me in.  Im not trying to be a party pooper, just a realist.   What can we do to hedge our cryptos within a blockchain environment?  Stablecoins?  If other cryptos crash, how could a coin like Dai possibly hold value?"
none,"I'm not a pro, but  have been cross country skiing alot.  I should be ok enough. I'm thinking the K, booze and mush are not good options... Although...

none,I ordered a G5 on Feb 16th a week ago.  A buddy of mine down the road ordered an Inspiron laptop 2 days after. How has shipped. Mike hasn't even updated as being in production. Why does it take a week to even begin production?
none,"Can anyone help with this?    I feel lik contacting my local, provincial and national media and explaining this entire situation with Exodus.  Crypto was touted to be a better solution than stocks and central banks.  Its turned out to be worse.  This is worse than Robin Hood.  theres no accountability here and no recourse for users.  I have been compiling records with times dates and details of whats going on.  Basically anytime Id want to any number of my cryptos, (big swings up or down) i cant.  Im not a complainer.  so I will take action here , but wanted to reach out and seee if theres any explantion,"
none,"It seems as soon as we get a boost wether up or down (the biggest time a person would want to make an exchange ) some of the currencies are unavailable to exchange.  Its great that we have 100+ available cryptos to trade, but if we cant actually trade them its not a valuable service, its actually a hinderance as it might be more profitable to hold on an exchange where we can trade a few swings.  I think Exodus os great.  but its not a brand new app.  its been around for awhile.  why are the markets so diversified that we cant make echanges.  Instead of investing 100% of value in to 200 different cryptos (giving just 0.5% of the potential dollar value of crypto in each) spreading it thin,  We could have just 50 cryptos and have potentially 400% of the assets in each one allowing people to actually make trades.  I know this isnt exactly how it work, and i know exodus doesnt have control over this.  But this is a big issue.  Please tell the market makers, less diversity, more liquidity in the smaller assets.    Let me trade my alt coins."
none,"My last last got downvotes.  Will try again. Once my wife and I settled for the fact that we didn't need half the garbage that out fellow Americans had we were actually able to start getting ahead.  Not out of poverty... We will stay here, but we are making poverty a comfortable place. That might sound ironic or sarcastic but it's doable for some at least.  I'm sure I will get the downvotes. But having a perspective of loving life and rejecting the capitalist rat race is beautiful. Being born in america we have already won half the battle.The other half is realising that we don't need to live the way our peers encourage us to and finding our own joys and peace, right where we are.  In my 20s I was always looking ahead.  Working trying to do better.  It was alot of stress and I yes moved up a bit  but I realised that I could keep working my whole life and odds were I wouldn't get past a few % more in the per capita net worth race.I decided to actually jump back down a few notches. And settle down and just learn and grow and love.Edit: the post seems to be really bringing out the negative side of some people here.  I didn't claim to be poor as dirt or surviving off rice.   Just well .under  the poverty line.I decided years ago to cut costs drastically.  It was not an easy adjustment. But then it allowed me to actually get out of debt and save up for tools to help me in life."
none,"The average canadian makes some massive amount compares to the global.poverty line.   Families in the world are living on $5 a day.I won't ever get out of poverty but what I can do is quit resigning to a pre fabricated mentality that making a 15k usd a year is 'poverty'  That's $40 a day.   That's literally 10x what many people make. Yes things are costly here but we have options to not consume.5 years ago my wife and I realised that having 2 cars was insane.  One car was used alot and the other one sat in one parking spot or another for literally 99.5% of it's days.We have never had cable/satellite. We pay $10 usd aonth for cell phones (each)We quit drinking (mostly) and smoking. (it was hard) While.its not al rainbows and butterflies life can be good in american poverty. Trapped?  I don't use that term because that implies a bad place. After we gave up our consumerist lifestyle we found life to be pretty great... It was really painful.af first learning what we didn't need. But when you have what you need to keep your family.healtht, warm and fed... That's pretty great.Edit:. Not trapped but chilling."

none,"For some reason my Exodus wallet has recently been randomly recieving small amounts of Tron.  I've never bought, sold or mined any tron.  I have nothing to do with it.

none,"It shows around 7% variable APY in the main list in the same spots as Cardano, Atom and Algorand show theirs.But for Dai it also shows a higher % in the compound app which costs alot of $ to stake.algo collects automatically as it sits in your wallet.How does Dai work?"
none,Getting the 3060ti with a new PC for a reasonable deal.  student discounts because you know us students need to game. Lol.But I'm actually going to be using it mostly for mining and basic stuff. Not alot of gaming I had intended to just get a cheaper multimedia computer but when I realised that I could profit $5+ a day in crypto it only makes sense to spend a bit more.Any advice?My biggest concern is that I'm a beginner at mining. And I only a moderate computer need.  I need to figure out how to properly use the card without burning it out in a year's time .   If I can keep it running for 2-3 years that would be mint.  Please advise fellow cryptonites!
none,"I saw dai says 7.04% variable APY.Bur then it sat around 11-12% APY  when I go to the Compound tab.1: does the 7.04% stuff stake automatically just like algorand? (Where is just stakes right away and I collect whenever I want in rewards?  I can see anything about Dai in the rewards section. Tho?)2: when.i went to stake around 200$ worth of Dai it's claiming that it was ta a $170 ethereum fee...This can't be correct, no one would be $170 to stake a bit of Dai.  Is that a.lunt of ETH held as a sort of collateral.or somthing?Or is that really the fee that's being asked atm to stake dai in 'compound' ?Someone explain. This please. Wanting to stake some Dai at a stable price to hedge against a big drop in price, but obviously it would be completely retarted (sorry to the disabled) to do any sort of stakeing at a 90% fee rate lol"

none,"People on here need to realize as amazing and awesome as drugs are and at times viable, useful and positive... They are actually very dangerous and potentially psychologically threatening.  They can even effect multiple generations.   These prevailing negative attitudes people have ... Are not for no reason.  Yes reefer madness was a very real thing.  And it continues in to other drugs.  And we need to focus on harm reduction and education no doubt. (I'm still for legalization of all drugs.  Or most anyway) we can't just ignore the fact that people do drugs. Or punish people for their problems and attempts at self medication.  But coming from someone who -like most of us 35+ Y/O folks in here- has indulged thoroughly in most of the main classes listed in the flair category:. DRUGS ARE POWERFUL.  And they have a big impact of on our  brains. I used to feel like it was all fun and games and self medication was fine.   But now at 38 I realize that I'm lucky and even tho I took great care all these years to not become addicted and not OD, I have still been effected negatively... (Along with some positive) Taking up meditation has helped me to realize that using drugs has essentially blocked me from really experiencing certain negative processes (and even some positive ones, or just challenging ones that would have helped me learn and progress in life) that I needed to experience to make myself a better person and be In control of my mind.Medications (self prescribed or otherwise) cloud emotions and thoughts and prevent us from truly coming to peace with some things.  Yes they were great while I used them and I had some epiphanies on ones like DMT, MDMA, LSD, Psilocybin, K.  Yes many are good and useful as I said... But there's just two sides to every coins.And for the great powers they have... Like Spidey said... Powers/responsibility.  It's a yin and yang thang.We all need more education on how tomuse these drugs in a theraputic way. I hope our governments my I've towards education and risk reduction and change from a punishment oriented response to a healing one.For my kids.   They are only little ones now but I'm 95% certain that they will find meth and coke and mdma and lsd and salvia, and dmt and xanax and alcohol and more waiting for them in life."

There's alot of negative to it as well.  I slept for about 40 of 48 hours straight... Hopefully that gets better.Not even strange... More like familier... My dog accidentally bit me when I was giving him a treat... And I felt a type of pain that I hadn't felt for what seemed like years... It hurt... But somehow it was comforting as well... Like driving through your home town or something when I been away for many years...I remembered a huge detailed dream that spanned days and Included all sorts of small details and a storyline like a movie...I feel like it had been way more than a year since I had any deep dream like that.  More like 10 or 15 years... That I remembered anyway.I am experiencing bad headaches and overwhelming in tiredness. But when I'm awake... I feel... New in a way.  I'm thinking about my family in a new light... Probably an old one actually I had just forgot.  I guess the headaches are probably just from sleeping for 10 hours,.awake for a few and sleeping 10 more.  Without drinking nearly enough water...My wife told me she noticed me smile today.  In the time I was awake.  I find myself having little shots of  what seems new; amusement.  I hope the exhaustion goes away and I hope that the amusement stays.Crying Tears for no reason.  Not happy not sad.  Just some combo, but for not good reason.Waves of... What I can't even describe as emotions... More like... Being ... Waves of existence washing over me.Like I came back from another life... Some sort of Dejavu based feeling... It's not good or bad... But it's both and in a way atm it feels good more than bad.

With my pixel 3xl I could be wearing earplugs with a fan on the night stand and the phones alarm would jar me awake...  This am my first night with my pixel 5 and I slept thru my alarm. :( No earplugs even.I guess I will try a different alarm chime... But this doesn't seem right.Got my pixel the same way I got my other two. Lightly used second hand for about 50-70% the price of new.  This time 70% as it's only been available not many weeks in canada.I always just thought google would give me at least decent enough hardware...  Dam... Now I have to consider other phones?

But I find drugs in general quite interesting and enjoy the really chill feeling that benzos bring (if I'm able to not fall asleep)But one thing I realised is... If I ever went on a bender... I'd very likely order a retarded among of shit from the internet.   Have you guys ever done this?  Pope's some xannys and woke up 2 days later with like 20 amazon prime boxes waiting at your door? And how would you prevent that from happening?  Seems like it might be hard...at least for me.

Binge and ate 2 grapefruit a day for about 3 days.

none,"I've never been addicted to opiates but I'm what the professionals would call a polysubstance abuser. I would not say I abuse but instead use various substances to self medicate.  But I admit there have been times on my life where it was verging on abuse.  In the 6 months since I began Suboxone I've not used other drugs aside from a few evening of less than 5 or 6 alcoholic drinks.  I haven't had that urge, so it's working well to curb my polysubstance use.  I work as a. Counsellor myself, helping people through daily challenges and beign there for them and doing my best to guide them through life.  I'm not a typical counsellor, I work with 'at risk' people; drug addicts, people with fetal alchohol syndrome, etc.    And I don't have an office at work.  I go to their homes and work with them there. (Vain background info completed ;-)6 months ago I started subs.  In Canada (my place of residence, if you are fair person, please consider moving here, it's pretty great; our governent is slightly less insane) the doctors prescribe Suboxone like any other medication.  There's no BS special subs doctors.  It's a normal med.   It's nice to be able to deal with your family doctor.  So getting to the point, had anyone experienced any changes in their bodily mechanics aside from less frequent stool movement?   What I'm thinking of it... Joint pain, deterioration. Being an opiate subs obviously numb pain.   I'm wondering if this pain numbing effect is resulting in me not noticing certain small pain signals that my body would normally send me to let me know that my knees or shoulders etc are stressed.  And maybe I'm overworking them without knowing?6 months after starting I'm now noticing what seems to be similar to arthritis symptoms.  I am 38. Maybe just getting old. But I've never had anything like this in the past.   Any experience with this?"
none,Ontario.May get a scooter one day.  Also interested in the onewheel however but it's quite expensive.   Also I'm 250lb 6'6 so that's an issue.

I have some medium hills on my route. Nothing more than about 15 degrees tho I think. Speed isn't much of an issue as long as it's as fast as a jog which I know almost all are.Any recomendations?

It is in a small town about 150km from the nearest major city. We are hearing about the mandatory closures of licensed daycares in other municipalities (Toronto to start). This daycare in question is a primary source of income for a family.Should she consider closing the daycare for awhile, (and risk loosing the clients in an area where clients are hard to come by)?One of the parents works at a hospital as a nurse.n The Daycare operator has kids of her own, but no required contact with any elderly citizens.I know it will be a personal choice decision in the end but just wanted to hear some measured, logical opinions.Closing the (in home) daycare would mean a hardship and loss of income for the operator, but seems like the more prudent thing to do."
none,I'm on subs and i just thought of this issue... What if I get in a car accident of something and I really need some pains badl in short notice...Doesnt bupe block the effects of allmother opiates?  What if I need surgery or am very badly hurt at some point or somthing like that?   Doesn't it take 4+ days to get out of my system enough for most opiates to even work 50%?This seems scary to me.
none,I have the opportunity to go on bupe patches (no nalaxone). The dosage is 10mcg/hr... This still only adds up to 240 mcg / day about 0.25 mg/day.   Is the bioavailability 15 times strong with the patch? Or what am I missing that would add up to my 4mg/day dose?

none,"  I read the title of the sub and see it mentioned raw data.  I thought, you know what ya this sub seems like a reasonable place. It would be nice to have a community that isn't made of of pure Tesla fanboys and obbessive stock holders etc.  Less confirmation bias and more objective analysis to help me make informed decisions.  I made a quick post here today  with just some plain data.  The base price of two cars.  Nothing more all I posted was two prices without any added subjective opinions or any text at all aside from the prices. I got a bunch of negative and nasty replies.I understand there are always going to be pricks in any sub of more than a few hundred accounts.  this is well beyond that.  It seems to be verging on a majority of trolls or angry people who don't want to discuss any objective truths , just one sided. Like the opposite of the main Tesla sub.   Can there be no balance?Objective information seems unwelcome.I guess I should probably unsubscribe and let those people share their negativity with each other.  But why can't there be some sort of balance.  Somewhere between hate and love."

none,"I am a T00L fan.  They are basically my fav. band.  I still listen to all their albums on cycle weekly. Ive been hoping and waiting for years for a new album.  But... I have this haunting feeling... I cant quite describe it... Its part dread, part sickening anticipation.I have read reviews from other fans, some great, some bad.  It cant possibly be 13 years good.  But Im sure it will be sweet.   Im concerned that I will be disappointed, but equally concerned that I will love it.  Part of the later concern is that it will just get me deeper into the 'T00L fan' rut.  im from a small town and almost no one I know listens to or appreciates  T00L.  The music thus far has been majestic, and I feel like im a loner getting so much into it with my whole music life, with few (I do know ONE other fan, who lives 80km away from me) others to share the joy, sadness, fear and intensity that the music brings.So Im concerned that it will isolate me further.This might seem like a silly concern to some, but they have been my fav band for my whole adult life (I am 35 now) and I have thought often about how this has worked on my psychology.  Its not that I cant listen to other music... its just that T00L... they are the drug of choice for music.  I cant seem to kick them.  They have always been there for a quick, cheap and easy fix.What will this new album bring?  More connection with some sounds from another world, leading me down a path of twisted, lonely, yet beautiful catharsis...Warm and calculated... like heroin."

I've got lots of 24 hour fasts u der my belt an I was practicing IF for a good 3 months solid last year, where I did 18 or 20 hour fast each day and allowed eating the other hours.But each time I try for a fast over 24 hours I end up getting a headache after around 20 hours it seems.I understand hydration is Important and I start drinking water right away in the morning and continue all day as much as is comfortable.    This day I even added some salt on to my water mid day, but still have a headache.  (I am at about 20 hours ATM) I am 6'4  250lbs (down from 300).  How much water should I be drinking each hour and how much sal should I add to each L of water?   Is there anything else I can do to avoid these headaches?  I think of I could avoid them I would be Able to have the will power to go a full 48 and then maybe more in the future. Please advise! PS. The water seems to go thru me quick.  And I normally have a fairly salt diet."

But my wife started using it and we found out that her body has some issue with it...I never expected such an issue so it took awhile for us to figure it out.   She started having major pains in her chest area about 6 hours after dosing.  We. Ever even thought at first it was from the kratom as it didn't register being after the major effects wore off.  She actually went to the ER for it.  She quit using kratom and it stopped.  She tried it one more time two months later just to confirm and the pain returned. She said it was pretty bad like having some sort of gall bladder attack. Kratom seems like a great thing for most people I cluding myself but I wonder how many people would have this reaction?   She has never had a reaction like this to any other medicines, supplements or foods.   I hope it does not cause her any long term damage.  It was pretty bad.  Anyone else heard of this? Even if there is only 1 in 1000 people that might have such an issue, I feel like the community would do well to warn people about it.  Simply because after reading so much about it I really felt like it was a fairly benign substance aside from the desired effects.   I know we should all be careful with any substance even if it is a natural and well known one.BTW her dosage was just 2-3g."

We have come to the issue of using opiates at end of life.This is for terminally ill patients with a legit script for drastic pain (advanced Cancer or other such thing)I know it would be a source of pride and esteem to know that you have overcome an addiction.  The question is this:Would you  decline treatment because of the work and the struggle it took to overcome your addiction and remain drug-free in your life time?I feel like most would not refuse, but is there anyone who would?  If so what are your reasons.  could you please elaborate?Thank you for your time.PS I am a user and I read this sub all the time.  Im not an outsider.  I just happen to be taking a class where some info on this would be interesting for discussion and I felt there was no better place for this question than here!

If you take an opiate repeatedly shortly after the effects of the prior dose wear off (or even before the prior dose wears off) you become accustomed to the blissful existence and anything less seems unbearable.  What is a.safe amount of time to space out doses to avoid addiction if a person wanted to use opiates as a relaxant/social stimulant of sorts.(In a similar way that people use alchohol)Would taking one dose and then waiting 4 or 5 days (get through all the minor withdrawals from one dose, and feel normal and happy again without it) before taking another dose be sufficient?

none,"Last night I saw a Coinsquare advertisement while watching the Maple Leafs vs  ruins NHL game on CBC.  This is what pushed me to make this review.On Jan 6th I opened a coinsquare account and funded it immediately that day with flexipen with several hundred dollars.  I bought some bitcoin and ethereum. My account was verified shortly after funding. (I had a reference code)When I signed up I was promised a $20 sign up bonus within 5 days of funding and verification.I opened a support ticket at the end of January wondering where my bonus was.  I received a copy and paste response claiming that the sign up bonus was a new program and it would take a bit of time to get the bonus.  They closed the ticket without giving me any new information. I began to feel a bit ripped off. In Feb. I opened a second support ticket asking When I would receive my bonus and why it has taken so long.  Same copy and paste response.By the way just to open a support ticket was not an easy task.  They bury the option deep in the help section hidden behind a small text link.I decided to be patient and give the company some time.I opened a third support ticket in April.  Same copy and paste response.  After seeing the advertisement on CBC, knowing that this could cost many tens of thousands of dollars to run, not to mention productions costs and their claims of being ""professionals"" I was frustrated.Coinsquare can not afford or figure out how to pay it's current customers the promised sign up bonus yet spends potentially potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising while ignoring its current its customers.Coinsquare is not professional at all and treats its customers like they are meaningless.Do not open an account here, there are many other options."

This is for anyone looking at buying; a realistic, unemotional take.I am coming from a 2014 MBP. 13""I like OSX slot but I missed windows flexibility and gaming possibilities.The first few days if ownership I was not too impressed with Windows crashing.  In the 4 years I've had my MBP I can count the crashes I've had on 0 fingers. I had several freezes or crashes in the first days, but since then, and since I've done a lot of updating of Windows and drivers, it's been much better.I guess I just forgot how windowsy Windows is.Once past the first few days I have been happy with my purchase.  Thebhardwarw is good, I've had no issues and everything works as it should.I haven't used a mouse in 4 years, and I bought a cool RGB one (not razor, their mouse's are are nice but far overpriced in my opinion) The one issue I have is battery life.  I'm still happy with it, it's not really worse than most reviewers said.  If I wanted better battery life is have gone with the 1080p version. I wish I could have a better battery life with 4k screen and in this form factor, but I'm not sure if thats possible atm.Touch screen is fun to have if you have young children.For those wondering why I didn't window the 2018 refresh, I would rather have quality QA (not first production line with lots of potential for issues) than a slight increase in power of gpu or gpu.  Also  doudt I'd be able to get $650 off a 2018 model.  Coming from my base  line 2014 MBP the power in the 9560 is more than enough for my needs for years to come.

At that time in her life she was quite into the drug scene and it didn't seem that strange or preposterous to be attempting a driving test under such conditions.Driving to the government  drive test building felt awesome.  She was ready to rock.After a long night of shady darkness, playing  starcraft and cutting up lines, the bright morning light seemed intense and pierced through the windows of the old '97 caravan like angelic rays of warmth from above.She sniffled one last time, checked the mirror for  nostril residue and jumped out of the van into the daylight.Marching up the stairs of the big concrete building with purpose she swung open the glass  doors and burst Into the licencing office, eyes blazing red from unrest, hair not even brushed.  She still felt confident as fuck.  She was right on time for her appointment and did not need to wait.Meeting the instructor and signing some papers which she did not even read went quickly. The drive itself also seemed to go fairly well.  No major mistakes, however part way through the test she noticed that the instructor was looking quite concerned.  Each time she would look over the Instructor was always looking directly at her with a kind of sad, kind if scared look on his face.  Shouldn't he be looking at the road as well?If anything the cocaine had been helping her to focus and drive well, at least enough to counter the sleep deprivation.  Close to the end of the test the last big line was wearing off.  All sorts of nervous and paranoid thoughts began to creep in as she caught a glimpse of her own milky pale face in the mirror.  When was the last time she had a drink of water? As they parked back at the office the instructor seemed relieved.  Even though she made no major mistakes, Ashley felt a sense of dread now and knew that she would not pass.  The instructor quickly gets out of the van without saying a word and walks back up the concrete stairs entering the office through the same separate, side glass doors as he exited.The sunlight, the concrete, the overly reflective main entrance glass doors now seem terrorizing.  Why? Why must you shine Sun? Thought Ashley. She gathered herself and made the slow climb up the stairs.  Less graceful and seemingly much more difficult than it was just 40 minutes ago.  The bounce in her step was gone.Upon entering Ashley was surprised to learn that she had passed her test.  They shuffled her to the white screen for a picture.    Now her drivers licence is a picture of her all coked out, vampire like face, confused and surprised.She will never know if the instructor actually passed her legitametly or if he just didn't want to see her in there again and took pity on her."

none,"This is not an in depth technical review, but just my comments after having the Bose audio Upgrade.I had never planned on buying an upgraded audio system (which is odd since I do love music.  I was a contract DJ for 3 years) But I got it as an option in my Volt 2017 Volt.It was around $600 Canadian extra, which is a lot of money to me. it seems to go about 20-30% louder than your average 2017 standard vehicle audio and a bit extra bass and clarity.I honestly had hoped for more extra volume.  But the sound quality is quite nice.Would I order it again?  this depends on finances, but If i could afford it, yes.Its really nice to have some awesome quality music at my fingertips.  Not blown away, but after this experience maybe one day again in 8 years or so I will look in to ordering an even better sound system with a new car and spend more.Viva la Volt!"

(The second time it was .6)The only.reason we know this is because this person that found him shared this with us. He himself has not shared this with us.   Through his life he has mostly always been an open and caring person. Hiding things from his family is not like him.He has a girlfriend (about 6 months now) who is also a heavy drinker.  This is a bad influence but also since he has little else in his life atm the emotional support from her is somthing to consider.We have decided that we want to see him once a week at least now and support him as much as we can.

Frankly I would be slightly disappointed if my children choose not to do drugs.  

Ones such as  coffee and accetaminophine can be beneficial.

Ones such as psylocibin, and Lsd can lead to greater understandings through a shift in perceptions.

Ones such as alcohol and opiates used responsibly can enhance relationships and help to build inner peace.

Sobriety is best a large majority of the time, but why would we avoid using substances that can be tools.Is this completely unreasonable?Should I not hope for education and responsible use to enhance human life?The way I see it, it's either that or prohibition, which hasn't been working so well.

I've been involved in some animal rights activism and Practicing plenty of Vegan meals and basically lived Vegan for more days than not this year.

In my town there is not as much access to specialty Vegan products as I would have even in a small city.

none,"Lakeside Chevrolet Buick GMC in Kincardine, ON A car dealer that I can not trust.I would like to have been able to give this dealer a better rating but for the following reasons I can not:  (Experience outlined in detail)The service was poor, I felt mislead and, I in fact had to cancel an agreement I had to sell my current car because the dealer was unable to acquire a car for me, after promising me that they could.I went to the dealer for a test drive on May 1st 2017 to test drive a car and look into ordering a 2017 model.  After the drive they (the manager Luke, and the sales person Tori) said they could locate me the specific car that I wanted with the exact options that I wanted.  I was quite happy! the other dealers that I spoke to had told me that the car I wanted did not exist and that I would need to order one.  I expressed what the other dealers had told me to the Manager and sales person several times, but they reassured me that the car was available and they could find it and have it here in 1-2 weeks.  I put the deposit down, and waited patiently.  over the course of the next 10 days I corresponded with my sales person Tori a few times, still worried.  Upon more questioning about the availability, on May 2nd 2017 she wrote: ""The LT is definitely available with cloth seats.""I still was not convinced, but I trusted her and waited.10 days after I put the deposit down, on wed. May 10th 2017 I received a call and was informed that they could not acquire the car.I had to cancel the purchase agreement I had with another person for my current car.The manager and sales person were nice, polite and courteous, but to me what matters most is the deal.  When I go to a dealership I want to solidify a deal, not be mislead and have my trust broken.This particular dealer should, in my opinion, make it clear to its customers that when they say they can acquire a car, they mean, They MIGHT be able to acquire a car.Hopefully they learn from this experience, but they have lost my trust without a doubt."

I put a deposit down on a specific car being reassured multiple times that they can get it, and now i can't get it.Im pretty pissed.At this rate Maybe I would be better waiting for my Model 3 Reservation.

The election is June of 2018.I may not get the tesla (which should qualify for the EV grant) until after that due to ramp up delay.I do not make alot but have been saving up and can afford an EV with this grant.with a 12% approval rating it is very likely that the liberals will loose the election, probably to the conservatives.  I suspect they may pull the grant.Does anyone know, can they do this overnight??? or would there be some months warning before they pulled it.I want to support EVs.  without the grant I may not be able to purchase  one.

none,"For all you people out there that have gotten some silly large debt early in life with nothing to show for it:It can get better,  If you stick it through and learn from it.  There is hope!When I was 18 just before moving out of my parents home I racked up $35,000 in debt from gambling and other reckless behaviours.  I felt it was terrible.  It took me 5 years to pay it off on my own mostly working min wage or a few dollars above.  Right around the time that I had almost all of it paid off, I got a much better paying job and quickly paid off the rest.  I was so used to shovelling funds into my bank account that I just kept doing that, and living frugally... I was accustomed to it.  Now I have a house and plenty of savings.The debt seemed at the time like a huge mistake... But what I learned from it was how to save essentially.  While all my friends were out doing what 20-25 year old people did, (buying cars, traveling, having kids, partying, buying stuff) I spent mostly reading and attending cheap college, sitting by campfires and focusing on the future.I still did some partying, but frankly I think the debt saved me from doing even more detrimental activities.  I wont get in to numbers but, I just keep saving.  I am not used to spending money.Going into debt taught me how to live frugally, yet still enjoy life.  I spent many a night crying and contemplating bankruptcy or something... anything to get myself out of debt.  I was depressed at times.  Luckily my family was supportive emotionally.  They never gave me any money, even though I asked for help... begged at times.  I'm thankful now that they did not.  But they were always there to talk.In retrospect it was one of the best things that happened to me...What did not kill me, made me stronger.I'm sure many people do not have supportive families and face other problems as well.. I realize that I was/am lucky.  But just know that if you can manage to pay it off, and learn from it, things can get much better.edit:Spelling"

Im not arguing over the safety factor.  I do believe that it is safer in general.But if the car is actually self driving, then Tesla should take on Liability for any accidents that could potentially occur.  Otherwise, that would be BS."

I was at work all day, and got txt messages around 3pm from fellow cannabis investors, but alas, I could not act.I decided that I needed to figure out Stop orders.  (I've been trading for about a year, I should have learned long ago)  Its quite simple once you get past the terminology.

What kind of downside can we expect to see here? Im not asking when, but some theories about when they fall, will it be 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% losses before they level out, and eventually gain it all back and more...Its mostly been 5-10% losses on the down slope over the past 6 months, but the gains are getting much larger now, do you think the same will happen for the losses?"
none,"When I look at fighters like Cyborg that have been caught using roids in the past but are still now fighting...Fighters who have been proven to have used steroids should probably be banned from fighting ever again.

Tesla will need to cut costs obviously with the M3, I hope they do not cut their Data connection inclusion for 4 years.Tesla might be paying 1000-2000$ CAN for connectivity for 4 years.  that would be 2-4% of the total cost of the car, would could be a large percentage of the actual profit margin.Does anyone have any thoughts on this?"

(Toronto)I hope they will build a service centre in a closer city eventually (Kitchener?) still that would be 110km away or so.Just weighing options.I want an affordable long range EV badly, model 3 seems to be the only option atm.  If they offer a battery upgrade, I will take that, I would like to increase my range to 250-300 M if possible so that when I loose 20% in cold weather, I can still make trips to any nearby city."

We have been saving for a vehicle and have about 10k saved now.  (we have the model 3 reserved)Would any of you advise against buying the Model 3?  Do you think it might be too much of a financial burden for a low income family?  we could have 3/4 of the purchase price saved by 2018 and from what I understand the insurance should be cheap.(also we are ready to spend the $ to instal a 40 amp outlet in the carport in our house.)"

It's ""not polite"" to bring up the hundreds of thousands of people that have died in the past years in Iraq, apparently. There are wars begin waged all year round, not in defence, but for capital and leverage. While we respect the heroes of WW2, lets not forget, the wars did not stop."

none,"(* TLDR: GOLDEN RULE of a new printer: Absolutely NO MODDING until you've put 150 printing hours into the STOCK machine.)I've noticed that many people who are initially interested by the world of 3d printing are of course makers, creators, artists, do it your-selfers; i.e.; ""the creative type"". These also tend to be the type of people who are into ""engineering adjacent"" hobbies (and ultimately, awesome professions) like automotive modifications, do it yourself projects, or basically anything that has an element of customization and modification to make what ever it is you're working on better, faster, stronger, harder, etc. (Now that songs in your head lol)Having said that!!!!:If you're a noob and you're about to get/just got your first 3d printer, let me be the first to say CONGRATULATIONS and WELCOME TO THE CLUB!!!BUT,and I must be very clear when I say this:YOU'RE FIRST INCLINATION IS GOING TO BE TO ASK, What are the best mods to do first? OR How can I make this thing more badass like all the IG, Pinterest, TikTok,YT posts I've seenYOU MUST, I REPEAT, YOU MUST RESIST THIS URGE!!!!If you truly are going to be a genuine 3d printing nerd, I absolutely guarantee you that you will have hundreds of hours of head aches, frustration, and urges to quit along this path from Noob to Master. Let these problems come to you organically. Don't go looking for them, bite off more than you can chew and then think 3d printing sucks when it was just you that sucked the entire time because you wanted to run a marathon before you could even crawl. Awesome things require awesome efforts!So, to be abundantly clear:-THE GOLDEN RULE FOR ANY NEW PRINTER IS: -Set it up properly according to the manufacturer's recommendations.-Print your Benchy (test print) until its absolute perfection!!And lastly, the main part of the Golden rule you must follow:-RUN YOUR PRINTER A MINIMUM OF 150 PRINTING HOURS BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT MODDING IT!!!!Now if you're anything like me (a rebel without a cause that absolutely has to learn everything on your own and never take any advice from the wise masters that have came a thousand times before and have beaten the path you now follow but are to blind to see past your own ego), the next thing you're going to say is:BUT WHY?????When I was a child, when ever I asked a question that in some way challenged an authority, I was always given the answer ""because I said so!!"" I hated that answer and it was my father's favorite reason and it pissed me off so hard from hearing teachers and any other adult or authority figure in what ever context applied, that I vowed to never use those words. So here goes, your proper answer to the ""WHY""!*ahem*If you are, like I said in the beginning, the creative type and just for the sake of an analogy let's say you're into modifying cars. You would then know what ""tuna no crust"" means and that introducing new parts to a perfectly good, brand new, factory sealed warranty sticker still intact, vehicle is a no no because its already designed to do exactly what you bought it to do. However, things break, some things aren't right from the start (recalls, poor assembly, shipping damage, bad engineering, etc) hence the warranty.If you're plan from the start was to mod your shiny new toy, then you're really going to want to put it through its paces before you do so, right?Work out all the kinks, get everything broken in and running smooth and all that good stuff. Then you're going to need to learn the basics like how to change the oil (filament), update the GPS (firmware), change the brake pads (nozzle, bowden tubes, etc). You know, the basics. How the hell would expect someone to know how to install new  headers if they can't even change the tire? Starting to get the picture?Now let's say you're on hour 78 of this 150 hour journey and you have a print failure?You obviously know good and well its not your fault because you printer is still completely stock right? After 10 youtube videos, two posts on reddit, and 13 hours of tinkering, you finally realize the problem!!! Your filament has been next to your plants and its absorbed too much moisture and needs to be dried. Also wouldnt hurt to do a tune up while you're at it as well. Check your rollers for the proper tightness, maybe pop in a new nozzle (the right way!!! Again, youtube it) and make sure the belt tension is good and the bed is nice and level.CONGRATULATIONS:YOU'VE JUST LEVELED UP FROM LVL 1 NOOB PRINTER TO LVL 3 CLERIC NOVICE!!! GREAT WORK SOLDIER!!! But don't get comfy yet, we've only just begun😈. (watch The 2007 classic horror movie starring John Cusack, 1408 for this pop culture reference easter egg masterpiece ❤.)You're now on hour 123 of your GOLDEN RULE warrior's journey. You've book marked countless mods on thingiverse but you've held strong to your Golden commitment and won't slice them until you're journey is over. You're staying strong and you see your print has some audacious horrible layer shifting and terrible under extrusion. But Fear not!! Although it will ultimately take you 34 hours of tinkering, due diligence, studying hours upon hours of Maker's Muse, Filament Friday, 3d printing Nerd, and the ever so easy on the eye's, Naomi ""Sexy Cyborg"" Wu on youtube, you will have finally found out that your E Steps were off and the table your printer has always been on was apparently bumped into by your dog, pushing it onto a low spot on the floor and making it shake ever so slightly everytime your printer makes a move. You just so happened to notice this when the sun hit it just right during your seventh test run. So now that you know how to calibrate e-steps like a boss, you upgraded your firmware while you were at it, and you've made that table nuke proof,WELL CONGRA-JA-FAH-KING-LATIONS FORMER CLERIC NOVICE!!!!! YOU'RE NOW A LEVEL 7 COMPETENT APPRENTICE PRINTER!!!! You're now able to help your once fellow noob friends on groups and forums just like these along you're shared quest to FDM printer mastery! And, now my young printer, I must say, I am truly proud that you resisted the urge to print some lame ass attempt at a dual cooling fan hot end mod that left you with nothing but a piled up, took apart printer, 3 lost machine screws, and so much frustration that you haven't touched the thing in almost a month now and if you did, you'd just realize you've forgotten nearly everything about putting it back together and have to subconsciously admit defeat by exclaiming ""this printer is a POS!""As a matter of fact, you've also just crossed 150 hours!!!! My God youre a person of honor and courage and we commend you for staying  steadfast to your commitment, even though everyone you love thinks you're kind of weird and totally doesn't get it! You now have a phenomenal breadth of knowledge about your printer and know exactly what mods you should, no, NEED to start with! Plus if you have the almost guaranteed hiccups we all have during the installation process, because your the only person you know in real life who's into this awesome futuristic technology, you will have a super strong foundation of working knowledge about how your printer works and know damn well its the mod causing the problem, not some simple Noob issue that you wouldn't have had the slightest clue about had you done this straight out of the box!!!I want you to know that I'm super proud of you my fellow nerd. Stay strong, ritious, and forever curious my dear modder friend, and may your builds be talked about and liked throughout the digital land!!!"

It would need 60 votes to pass, no Republicans have spoken in favor of it, and it is not even clear that all Democrats would vote for it.And even if it were to pass, moments after a Wednesday press conference announcing the bill, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters had opposed marijuana legalization in the past and ""nothing has changed.""Still, the Senate Majority Leader putting his name on a marijuana legalization bill is a big deal, a sign of how far the issue has come. According to a summary of the 163-page draft bill, the measure would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substance Act and shift regulatory authority over it from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Food and Drug Administration. Each state would determine its own marijuana policies, and federal criminal penalties would remain for growing, possessing, or distributing more than 10 pounds in violation of state or federal law.The bill would set the legal age for purchase at 21 and limit purchases to 10 ounces  ""to prevent illegal actors from purchasing large quantities of cannabis at retail in a cannabis-legal state and illegally trafficking that cannabis into other states with the purpose of circumventing state-level laws relating to the sale, production, or taxation of cannabis.""The measure addresses social equity concerns by creating three grant programs—one in the Justice Department and two in the Small Business Administration (SBA)—to channel resources to people and communities adversely impacted by marijuana prohibition. The SBA grants to states and localities will be conditioned on the passage of state laws that expunge previous marijuana convictions.The bill also calls for the automatic expungement of non-violent federal marijuana convictions and would give people currently serving federal sentences for marijuana convictions a sentencing review hearing that would essentially set them free: ""After the sentencing hearing, courts shall expunge each arrest, conviction, or adjudication of juvenile delinquency for a non-violent federal cannabis offense, vacate the existing sentence or disposition of juvenile delinquency, and seal all records relating to a conviction or adjudication that has been expunged.""The act would see marijuana commerce federally taxed and regulated, with federal taxes beginning at 10% in year one and increasing to 25% by year five. In a boost to small producers, the first $20 million in sales would be eligible for a 50% rebate.I am proud to introduce our discussion draft of the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, a legislative proposal aimed at finally putting an end to the federal prohibition of cannabis and addressing the over-criminalization of cannabis in a comprehensive and meaningful way, said Majority Leader Schumer in a statement announcing the bill. ""The War on Drugs has too often been a war on people, and particularly people of color. Not only will this legislation remove cannabis from the federal list of controlled substances, but it will also help fix our criminal justice system, ensure restorative justice, protect public health, and implement responsible taxes and regulations.""Cannabis prohibition, a key pillar of the failed War on Drugs, has caused substantial harm to our communities and small businesses, and especially for communities of color, said Senate Finance Committee Chair Wyden. ""It's as simple as this: Senators Booker, Schumer and I want to bring common sense to the federal government, end prohibition and restore the lives of those hurt most and set them up for opportunity.""For decades, our federal government has waged a War on Drugs that has unfairly impacted low-income communities and communities of color, said Senator Booker. ""While red and blue states across the country continue to legalize marijuana, the federal government continues to lag woefully behind. It is time for Congress to end the federal marijuana prohibition and reinvest in communities most impacted by the failed War on Drugs. I am proud to introduce this landmark piece of legislation with Senator Wyden and Majority Leader Schumer that will finally turn the page on this dark chapter in American history and begin righting these wrongs.""Marijuana and drug reform activists were generally pleased, although there were some quibbles. And since this is a first draft, now is the time for those quibbles to be heard.The days of federal prohibition are numbered, said NORML Executive Director Erik Altieri in a statement, adding that ""the supermajority of Americans are demanding that Congress take action to end the cruel and senseless policy of federal prohibition.""For justice reform, for equity, for individual liberty, and countless other reasons, it is time to respect the will of the American people and legalize cannabis. I am heartened by the Booker, Schumer, Wyden bill draft, which is a promising first step towards Senate passage, and hopeful that it will lead to negotiations and bipartisan support for an inclusive and equitable legal cannabis industry, said Steven Hawkins, executive director at the Marijuana Policy Project, in a statement.  But the Drug Policy Alliance, while pronouncing itself ""grateful"" for the bill emphasizing social equity, reparative justice and reinvestment, said in a statement more work needed to be done.[W]ork remains to ensure justice does not fall short, said Maritza Perez, Director of the Office of National Affairs for DPA. To our dismay, the Senate draft contains exclusionary language that ended up getting added to the House-passed MORE Act last year that would continue to subject federal employees to drug testing and deny certain individuals—who have already paid the highest price—the opportunity to expunge their records. In order for this bill to truly end marijuana prohibition in a comprehensive way and begin to repair the egregious harms of the past, we cannot continue to make room for some to be left out because of laws that were unjust and racist to begin with. We call on the House to remove exclusionary language from the MORE Act and swiftly pass the bill and implore the Senate to also remove this language ahead of bill introduction.""The wall of federal marijuana prohibition may or not fall this year, but its foundations are rapidly decaying, and the issue is squarely before the Congress."
none,"* **EDIT # 1**- (It got a little long winded so see the end of the post and don't forget to join r/STDW if you agree 😉  By far the most amount of times I had people ask me this question (who didn't know I was an opiate addict at the time),  Like coworkers or Fairweather friends, those types of people was when I was in withdrawal (I've been heroin  / oxy, etc. for almost 8 years). Now the next thing I'm about to say may be very controversial/offensive because a lot of people,  especially those who follow the tenants of narcotics anonymous, and I mean this in the very kindest of terms, are indoctrinated into a cult. Listen if thats what saved you or your loved one then I'M SO SO HAPPY FOR THAT and wish nothing but the best. Having said that, its just not for me. I'm hard-core atheist, like borderline Satanist (not the ones who believe in the antichrist but that religion is an illusion used as an opiate for the masses and I'm opiate free.But now that thats out of the way, I believe drugs are a tool just like anything else and when used responsibly can have a massive benefit. I'll just be brutally honest and put my cards on the table.-Methadone (60mg per day first thing in AM) saved my life and if you think its liquid hand cuffs you aren't using the program properly. I only go once a month.-I use adderall but I actually cycle it in conjunction with some nootropics because I did some extensive brain damage during my usage years. Three weeks on, 2 weeks off, with a strict titration schedule of up and down cycles. -OTC's/ Nootropics: i use MCT oil, fish oil, daily multi vitamin for men, fiber (methadone) along with occasional laxative as needed. - Methadone is a known testosterone inhibitor and as a longterm patient, I had my levels checked so I also do:* Testosterone Cyponiate 150mg IM once weeklyand last but not least, I really struggled with learning how to use this therapeutically and not recreationally but-1 mg alprazolam before bed ONLY!!! I have severe generalized anxiety disorder and this seems to actually do the trick. Once in a blue moon, if I'm in an especially nerve racking situation I will take .5 mg TOPS!!!!! I have to be super strict with this chSo judge if you want, but my clinical psychologist says I'm one of maybe 5 of his patients out of over 400 who have legitimately, and also for an extended amount of time (multiple years) have turned my diagnosed bipolar 1 disorder from a frothing mouthed rabid put bull to a whiny chihuahua at best. LolTalk all the shit you want but my life speaks for it self.I went from a homeless man with no family (not even a hug for over 3 years) dope head to a happily married, college graduate (self paid!!!) with an awesome job that I actually love doing and the pay is also great as well. Also if you've made it this far, thank you so much. I have one small favor to ask of you that would mean so much to me if you believe the following:The drug war is over, drugs have won, its time for change.If you believe this too, and think its time for things to change, please join my new sub, r/STDW.  (stopthedrugwar is already taken and I can't get in touch with the mod, its been dead for 8 years and only me and him are the only members and I'm trying to get him to give me his sub) But  it would mean the absolute world to me and its my hope that together, we can end this prohibition lunacy for good!!!❤🖤❤🖤❤🖤❤🖤❤🖤❤ Love you all!!!So for those of you that judge, think again.* **EDIT # 1**-   1st of all I would like to take the time to thank each and every one of you who has read this and said a kind word or left an upvote. But even more so, I would like to thank those of you who decided to join r/STDW (""stop the drug war"").  I can't tell you how much it means to me to get off of work and see our subs go from 2 to 10 in just a few hours and it gives me hope that that we'll see them go from 10 to a 100, and then to 1000, 2000, 5000 and who knows from there.  The way I see it, we are fundamentally no different as an opressed community as drug user/addicts then the LGBTQ community, minorities (especially African Americans), legit womens lib activists (not 3rd gen man haters) and In fact, especially minorities!! They have been so disproportionately affected by this stupid fucking ""war"" that I would dare say it was always just humanity it self, not Drugs. Hell even Nixon said that on the watergate tapes. Anyways I could go on forever but I wont. THANKS AGAIN AND DON'T FORGET TO BE SAFE, STAY RESPONSIBLE, DO YOUR HOMEWORK, AVOID ADDICTION IF POSSIBLE, AND IF YOU NEED HELP, ASK!!😍😋"

I dont think its infected, It really just feels like a harcore bee sting or something like that (Im allergic to bees btw). Also, my first 2 were in my thigh and it was quite sore for about 4 days after even causing a pretty bad limp but more itchy than anything for at least 2 weeks after without swelling or redness. So the third time was in my left rear end and the fourth was as well (My wife used to be a nurse and she administered these injections). First time in the left rear flank didnt hurt nearly as bad and barely noticed it so I thought I found the right spot but this second shot in my flank has done this. Probably should have switched to the other cheek maybe at the very least? I dont know, Im super new to this and have no one to talk to about  it besides going to the doc which Id rather not do.

none,V2 just black screened on me 🙄😤🤬. It's possible that it was from a firmware update I had on my sd card for a bltouch that I was going to switch onto it from my v1 but it was printing so we'll I didn't do it (The V1 is ancient and needs all the help it can get). I think I accidentally put that sd card in and now the screen is just black. Can I reset or what? Anyone else had this problem?

none,"My wife had cervical cancer at 31, shes in remission, but also is going through menopause because of it, had gone dead because of chemo, and also cant have sex because the radiation fused her cervix. Even if she could, she totally doesnt want to because of menopause, the psychological toll it took on her regarding that body part, and god knows what else. I empathize with her so so much. Needless to say she's not in a good place mentally right now and I cant help her and that breaks my heart. I was suppose to be her rock and I crumbled as soon as the pressure came down. I was just so scared she was gonna die and I couldnt talk to anyone about it, in fact I had to act like there was absolutely no way she wouldnt beat cancer.When we first found out I was the only one who was willing to look at her 5 year survival odds. They were only 25 percent. I ended up having a nervous breakdown, taking too much of my anxiety meds and blacked out and did all kinds of completely ridiculous stuff like talking to women online (I've never physically cheated in my life but now she believes I have and I dont blame her.) So because of all this she thinks divorce is best. My first instinct is to fill the void with a girl friend because I dont have any family to fall back on and I struggle with chronic loneliness and depression. But Im still in love with my life and it wouldnt be fair to the girl friend. Plus I dont want my wife to think that it was just so easy for me to move on, which it isn't, Im just so similar to a dog (men are dogs I know) and I need my best friend. I really just want a female friend because I'm a welder and those aren't the type of guys who talk about their feelings and could care less about yours. Seeing a guy loose a finger doesnt even make them cringe half of them just laugh, 40 percent just watch and 10 percent help. Where and how can I find a woman I can be friends with that can sympathize with me and we can talk about our stuff without sexual tension becoming an inevitable thing? Im just so so lonely and I miss my best friend so bad who is seriously distancing herself from me even though she says she really Hope's we can stay friends forever. I know shes depressed too but I just cant do anything to help her even though I'd give my right arm if I could. What do I do?!?!?!?Oh Im mildly agoraphobic and I dont drink too so bars and places like that dont particularly help either. Although I'd be willing to try, I just dont want to spend what little money I have left from them covid layoff and all the medical expenses.I'm not opposed to guy friends at all or gay friends, just someone who actually cares."
none,"First of all, I'm so glad this sub exists because this has been the hardest year of my life and I've had an abnormally difficult life. My parents divorced when I was in 6th grade because my dad was gay and my mom had issues too with cheating on him, using him as a caretaker not a partner, and severe bipolar (which I've inherited and am officially diagnosed bipolar 1) Any ways long story short, I was sexually abused by several of his friends and he turned a blind eye. Even when I finally got over the fear and shame of telling him. He and his husband, would just treat me like a black sheep so I became very rebellious and any time I ""got in trouble"" I had two dads screaming at me and I wasn't allowed to have an opinion. That was a nuclear decision to say anything back but yes sir no sir. I can elaborate for pages but my point is, I hope I can find some friends and solace in my current situation. My wife has cancer but I have issues with addiction and I over dosed some meds so were separated now, plus I had a seizure and wrecked my car because of some of the meds the doc tried to help my bipolar and I'm laid off because of covid. The only reason I'm not homeless is because I cant be evicted right now because if covid. I'm trying to repair our relationship. I'd give it a 15 percent chance of survival. My wife's cancer survival rate in the next five years is 25%. But I cant even be there for her treatments. I'm an adult now but I just cant help but wonder who I would be if I was a normal kid who wasn't abused and marginalized."
none,"I'm so glad I have you guys to speak openly about how I feel politically. I'm actually technically not a communist or a capitalist there's not a name for what I am I don't think. But if I said the following on Facebook:If the billionaires didn't give away all of our jobs to China and the rest of the poor countries 20-30 years ago, that would work for pennies on the dollar then the United States economy would still be the world superpower. Now the Communist superpower that is China is, is able to use that money as they see fit because it's a communist country not a severely outdated democracy, and become one of the world's leading superpowers in record time.But unfortunately lobbyists are legal (in my opinion they should be illegal as s***) and they can go in and buy favors from leaders of the United States government and essentially corporations have all of the leaders of the government in their back pocket. It doesn't matter if you're Democrat, doesn't matter if you're Republican, or libertarian, or you are an independent, what matters is our leaders are puppets for corporations. They are no longer leaders but followers, they do as they're told by corporate entities. I'm sure it goes way deeper than we can all ever imagine but like I said if I posted that on Facebook, I have 500 friends I'd have zero likes and probably about 15 comments all about arguing about the stupid propaganda the the fake news puts out everyday instead of thinking rationally and realizing that we are nothing but cogs and gears of a war machine empire."

A. Do you think it can handle all these devices. It will have plenty of input from the solar side of things. B. Are there any recommendations, opinions, or advice you guys can offer. like what's the best place to order parts from especially breadboard stuff.

She's currently going through radiation and chemotherapy because she is diagnosed at Stage 3C (the last stage before stage four which is the final stage of cancer) which means its progressed to her lymph nodes as well as her pelvic wall and other non organ abdominal areas, meaning radical hysterectomy was out of the question. She being a trooper and also my hero because she's being so strong. She does have some really bad days and nights though; especially with abdominal pain and has so far refused narcotic pain relief because she's seen first hand how bad opiate addiction can be. I literally have to sleep on the floor because the slightest movements makes her abdominal pain so bad it wakes her up for at least two hours. She had to quit her job and I'll hopefully have a job soon (we just moved back to NC from Myrtle Beach two weels before she was diagnosed and I'm a welder by trade and welding jobs are hard to find in the winter around here for some reason. But its got to the point where I'm not buying my medicine for my epilepsy so we can afford her medicine. Hopefully she'll be put on disability soon (medicaid requires you to either have children or be on full disability to qualify for Medicaid and since were between jobs we obviously don't have insurance). In the mean time we've gone completely through our entire life savings paying for all this. I am a hopeful man who prays daily and we have so many friends and family praying for us but I'm also a rational facts based man. Best case scenario, as long as her cancer stays the way it is, she has a 63% of being alive still in five years. Worst case scenario she has a 30 to 50 percent chance in three years. Im so scared for her and selfishly, I'm scared to be a 35 year old widower. We won't even be able to have kids because of the cancers location not to mention she has endometriosis and we have about 12 miscarriages so I won't even have a child by her in case the worst happens (which is why we didn't think anything was particularly wrong because of the endometriosis) She's my soulmate and I couldn't find another woman as perfect for me as her. I just had to pawn my guitar to pay or rent. We are very proud people and can not stand taking hand outs but we have no idea what else there is we can do.

none,"Anyone who's ever lurked on wish.com or the app, or even seen an advert for some sex toy for sale on or a similar purveyor of Shenzhen produced oddities while scrolling your grandma's Facebook wall, please post it here.

none,"I'm typically a Coinbase, localbitcoins, etcetera user but today my bank account is currently in the negative because my wife has cancer and our hospital bills are ridiculous. I only over spent 3 dollars on one transaction and 10 on another but the ""fees"" have me at -$144.87 despite me supposedly having explicitly asked not to have overdraft protection nor should they allow any transactions take place if my account couldn't cover it. So I decided to use a Bitcoin ATM today considering I'm crunched for time. The BTC atm only had a $2.50 transaction fee which doesn't seem bad but, it didn't show me what they were quoting BTC's current price at which was over $8,500 when it currently sits at $7,255.39 according to bitstamp. It only told me this AFTER my transaction. So to put it in a layman's perspective, I paid $92.00 USD and received $65.72 USD worth of BTC in my wallet. So for those of you who hate Coinbase fees, I hope this can give you some perspective on the drawbacks of ATMs and more importantly the fact that they're only adding to the reluctancy of mass market adoption.  I know I'm a dumbass, autist, (damn sure not a noob, just a dude down on his luck) and I could have done this any number of other ways, just please try to remember I'm human and I'm on your team, and I only meant this as a PSA (and a bit of venting my anger at those who use crypto as a tool of manipulation rather than a tool of fair market modernization). Much love from USA ❤️ maybe r/theydidthemath can figure out where my break even price for BTC would be. Also this is not a hodl, this is a gift for my nephew in hopes he can learn the wonders of blockchain (a late Christmas gift, hence the reason I used the atm in the first place). Now my lovely redditor friends, you may commence with shredding me in any fashion you see fit. I'm sure I feel good and roasted when I come back to read this tonight. Happy coining.Love,u/rundmc214* Edit: I tried to go to several other locations in my area with ATM's that had a 4 out of five star rating or higher, but the first three cashiers I went to said they'd never heard of it, so I asked the managers and their response was I'm not sure but maybe we're getting one soon. ."

Right now it's stage 2b and Gynonc said it's too big for hysterectomy so we're looking at radiation and chemo barring the pet/Ct scan on Monday.

I'm scared.

I know for a fact all beans were accounted for and potted on a one by one basis. Now having said that,  has anyone ever heard of a seed bifricating into two seedlings?  The only weird thing that happened was I thought the five oh may possibly be coming into my house ( bible belt state)  so i set the seedlings in the trash can and covered them up.  All though I did this hastily,  I also did it with as much care as the situation allowed.  This caused some soil shifting but otherwise  nothing else was wrong.  Every seedling was fine and accounted for but because I didn't  want to stress them anymore,  I didn't  want to fix the soil  until a day or two later.  By this point I noticed 2 sprouts.  I figured one was obviously the seedling because the bean shell was still directly underneath it but figured,  fuck it,  i let the other grow just to see what kind of grass or weed or whatever it was.  It is most definitely however an mj seedling; they both are.  So after all this long winded blow harding,  what do you guys think.  Im stumped. 🤔🙇"

none,"So I grew up with a fairly large NC metal band that was popular during the 2000 and nots.  (We all graduated high school around 2003) So anyways they were recording one of their albums around the exact same time BTBAM was recording Alaska at The Basement with Jamie King. My best friend and I (as well as the entire band basically)  were really big into BTBAM and he noticed as he was tracking    his parts of the album that Jamie had a copy of the pre-mastered reference disc of the Alaska album sitting on the desk (presumably for BTBAM to listen to and make sure they were happy with everything before it was all mixed down and mastered).  Well we were always pretty bad kids as far as having that sex,  drugs,  and rock and roll,  ftw attitude so naturally he stole the reference track!  Jamie King definitely noticed it was missing but couldn't exactly pin it on anybody and of course could just burn another one just as easily.  So we were super stoked that we all had the new btbam album over a month before it released.  We went to the Alaska cd release show and we all knew every word to every song and you could visibly tell that Tommy noticed (because he would typically share the mic with the most raucous fans back then)  and had a ""what the fuck"" kind of look on his face when we were all in a group in the front of the crowd keeping up with his every lyric.  Definitely a great memory of my younger years.  Anyone else have any good ones?"

I also took some xtc with some friends, same batch, same amount and I felt like they were way further in their space than I was. any idea why I dont feel the effect of drugs nearly as much as people around  me seem to do?"
none,"A day is split into 4 parts, 12am till 6am is night, 6am till 12pm is morning, 12pm till 6pm is noon/afternoon and 6pm till 12am is evening, so why the hell are we calling 12am midnight, when it is clearly the beginning of the night?!?!?"

none,"This story happened yesterday so it is still freshly engraved into my mind.I was sitting in my college class and a friend pf mone tapped me on the shoulder and said that I should check my mail, well it turned out there was a massive spam going on where the college sent an invitation letter to some sort of event but instead of sending it individually they sent it to the whole school and everyone was replying to it.So I started reading the replies (that added up every 2 seconds) and saw a lot of good memes and the like. Also a lot of copypasta so I decided to join in on the fun and send some copypasta their way too. I saw a good one so I sent it amd all was good, then another friend saw the script of the ""the penguins of madagascar stop racism"" video and he said he really wanted it so that I should send it to him.Here is where I messed up. So I copied the entire pasta and sent it to him on discord, I also decided it would be a fun idea to send the shrek script to that spam that was still going on, I selected the entire script but didnt copy it, might've pressed ctrl v instead of ctrl c. So I decided to just paste it in the mail spam and send it there. But..... i sent the wrong one, my dumb ass didnt bother checking which one it was because well i thought I was smart enough to not mess up something so simple. So I sent the penguins of madagascar stop racism script. I realized my mistake as soon as I sent it so I just decided to focus on the assignment. But of course there just had to be a black girl in that class who was also checking the mails the entire time.... she gave me a death stare I wont ever forget.Tldr: i wanted to send some dumb stuff to a friend accidentally sent slightly racist stuff to the entire school and got recognised by a black person..."

none,"many times I've thought about the franchise and wondered why some of the games were more popular then the others one of the conclusions was that the continuous art style had a big impact arguably one of the worst Halo games rated by its likeability and popularity where number four and five.Leaving new introduced game mechanics aside, one of the things that made these games different from the predecessors was the fact that they had a drastic change in aesthetic style and design. What I think the first three games did right was that there seemed to be an evolution in art style made possible by the greater hardware capability of the Xbox 360 which allowed for more textures and lighting and details, thus refining the visuals. There seemed to have been a harmonic continuation of what was already there without completely reinventing the wheel so to speak. Going from the first titles to Halo reach and the games that followed after it we can see a discontinuation of this trend: [classic Halo CE marine](https://preview.redd.it/o1bv76z7plc71.png?width=269&format=png&auto=webp&s=592948d054eb546896d0960815f22bb55d9ec4bc)[ what I would have hoped for in Halo Reach. higher resolution of course since it's on the 360, but staying true to the tone and aesthetics of the game.](https://preview.redd.it/9hzwan1zqlc71.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=bec89674cb1747a84e6b96d9bc4f97e4c6d454f7)https://preview.redd.it/t96tsqe4ulc71.png?width=319&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8dc576714b0e6f5b7e33f745cd9911c3a0a664e[Halo Reach Marines. imo could be from any random military game. Is this still the same franchise?](https://preview.redd.it/7iq1cusqplc71.png?width=379&format=png&auto=webp&s=3404756a618fccd58bd4350a237dc16864e9292b)  Same with the chief between Halo 3 and 4: falls into cryosleep in mark vi armor then suddenly waking up with a weird looking new type of armor, and suddenly in Halo infinite is back to mark vi armorHalo Reach Marine: altough cool looking, no longer is there any congruence in the artwork and visuals effects and aesthetics easily spotted by things like weapons, the marines,  grunts vehicles, buldings.  for a game that is supposed to take place immediately before Halo combat evolved the incongruent art style compared to combat evolved is what really took the immersion out of me because the gear and weapons looked nothing like they did previously.I could give 10 more examples with forerunner architecture.The same applies to the sound effects and music to some dregree.not only does that not not make sense from a realism standpoint, it made the game less congruent. But what's your take?"
none,"What is really the point of all these wealthy guys trying to get into space first?I don't really get what the point of it is, without interstellar technology or the capability of terraforming and other planet inside of the solar system?To me it seems like it's more about their egos instead of anything actually useful. Am I missing something here?"

none,"To me: Halo 2 as the absolute banger: fast paced, very snappy, simplistic, satisfying as hell if you're good. Graphically aged like shit.Closely followed by Halo 3: very similar, more modern with new equipment  but feels a little slower. Pristine graphics and lighting imoLeast favourite: h2a because low frame rate and weird lighting"

none,"watching footage of the og Halo games recently made me realize again how immensely beatiful his music is. In fact I think it is so good, that I tend to think it's him alone who we can thank the most for Halos rise in popularity and love from the fans. now obviously, a lot of fans and me included had hoped to have Infinite's score made with involvement of Marty and Mr Salvatori, which didn't happen.Not shitting on the newer soundtracks at all here, but I think most people would agree that no other composer unfortunately has surpassed his work in the following games."
none,"I seem to find contradicting information on this. Some researchers say it is not known by what meachnism they give their health benefits , others claim they are excreted and only block cholesterol absorption , others again claim the sterols get used by the body and undergoes biotransformation to make hormones , due to their similar chemical properties.Apparently some worms and insects can do the latter as they have no access to normal cholesterol and can't make it for themselves Can you guys give me your two cents?"
none,"BR of course viable and strong in all of the games.Personally I think the H3 spiker is almost pointless and not fun to use Halo 1 shotgun felt like an actual gun, the H2,3 versions only have like two feet of range and only good in melee range Halo Reachs storm rifle is too similar to the plasma rifle Fire grenades were underused in Halo 3Halo 2s machine pistol sounds like shooting with tic tacs"
none,"It's getting to a point where I get headaches after half an hour with all these crazy effects, enemies, weird dialogue and colors going on.My brain can't keep up with all that What's next?? 5 hours of trip visuals?Personally I think BL1 had the best balance in that regard . No over the top shit and still funny and interesting"
none,"might be an unpopular opinion but personally I don't require them and they are more of visual a hindrance  in H4/5 for me than anything. Also it's great to see a clean kill through the reticle which gets obstructed by too much visual feedback.Being able to deselect them in the options would be fantastic, no?"
none,I
none,"To me it's this  ""does he usually mention me?"" line In Halo 3 where no one of the characters even responds to the chief after he says it because it was so weird XDThat one seemed really out of place"
none,Anyone who is into gaming has probably heard of it and most people obviously don't like it in games like Modern WarfareIt's when you don't have a diverse lobby and you only get to play people who are exactly as good as you. Exciting right????
none,So far only reach is out but which is great but what about the other games?
none,Yours truly: I think Halo 2 vista and the CE demo on PC was the funnest experience because they had a browser for matches and lots of CTF serversI also think  Reach is the weakest title in the franchise followed by 4
none,"That was SO fraaking satisfying to watch every single time , I'm sure you have seen it taken notice of it also! Somehow after Halo 3 they took it out for some reason :( the kills in later games look kinda lacklustre because of it. Bring it back for Infinite please!!"

none,"The character development, the friendship that forms between Data and Jordi, the inspiring qualities of each main crew member, new and interesting stories and mysteries in every single episode.I wasn't even born when it aired, but I have yet to find anything that comes remotely close in the sheer quality of the show.It doesn't have a ton of over the top action and special effects but it really doesn't need any of these things. You can tell that someone has put a ton of thought and dedication into into this series.If you are looking for depth and inspirational sci-fi, I think you'd most likely find it here. If anyone who contributed to it's production reads this, you have my thanks and utmost respect.Sincerely, a 25 year old person."

none,"To me it's like reading a book vs watching a movie based on the book: the less that is visually shown to you , the more your brain creates the vibrant Szenario in your head which is 1000x more satisfying. 🧚‍♀️ When you play an RPG for example and every visual is maxed out, it takes away from your imagination and just pre defines everything for you and that's boring, especially when the atmosphere is supposed to be mythical, ancient, surreal etc.A lot of really good and popular RPGs such as the first Zeldas have hideous graphics compared to today's standard but they are way more immersive and have become legendary games"
none,"Why don't we just fortify the medical system and number of health personnel in order to handle a bigger load of sick people instead?If this whole pandemic was not about creating a new feudal society of slaves,  wouldn't that be the more sensible approach?Clearly the priority seems to be to use every opportunity to justify more restrictions and not to lessen them..Do they honestly believe people don't see the real agenda behind all that?"
none,"New chick in class that is my personal HB 10. took me more guts than usual but I approached her with some convo, because she often looked in my direction and stared at me.

After that she still always looked in my direction and still made eye contact. No smile but kind of an insecure looking gaze.What to do from here?"

Using an MSI G241 IPS panel.With my previous  60 hz Monitor each frame was at least sharp and didn't overlap” with another.Another question, will going for a 240 hz panel reduce that effect? I don't necessarily want to achieve more frames but I want frame sharpness if that makes sense."

none,"People talk about these things as if they could actually define what they are or as if they are real but many people have never in their lives come across any of them. They like to use „4th and 5th dimensional entities and pretend that they actually know what all of that is, it's unscientific and mentally ill.None of these things can be proven or even defy scientific analysis."

none,"Many green flags but doesn't know how to say no to other men touching her, has no sense of self respect for such matters, probably due to lack of father.Otherwise excellent qualities for long term investment."
none,"If any institution, platform, search engine or authoritarion starts censoring information or peoples voices they basically acknowledge that they fear the power of whatever it was that was said, and that can't cope with it or counter it with a better counter argument. It always comes out of a position of weakness and It means what ever it was that was censored is too risky and a threat (to them).The proper counter is to come up with a better opinion or standpoint and let people decide for themselves.To simply ban information is an unfortunate trend and makes any institution instantly untrustworthy"
none,Did you feel the effects of DIM stopped when discontinuing the product or are they long lasting?It does seem to work on reducing estrogen levels but I'm not gonna buy a new bottle every month for the rest of my life.Thanks friends.
none,Because sadly Most people don't enter a discussion with the mindset of  I'm gonna listen to what someone has to say so maybe I can expand my understanding of the matter”
none,Preferably a bit cheaper too and purchasable in bulk.Anyone have any good experiences detoxing estrogen in another way? Cheers
none,"The game is getting a lot of shit both right now since the dev announced the cut of further support but also earlier in its lifespan for various issues such as varying the TTKHaving only played Modern Warfare in the last months I find Battlefield V currently is much more immersive , has better gun handling where guns don't just feel all the same, has beautiful aesthetics especially in  the pacific, performs better on mid end PCs."

Is it maybe some file somewhere that causes the issue on both cloned harddrives? Thanks"
none,"It doesn't even matter how much I like their company. when the deed is done I prefer my own company most of the time and just hearing women chatter about anything for the most part is almost never as enjoyable as with guys.I  like engaging with them when I have yet to conquer them, once they are conquered the game is over, they all start clinging and the motivation lessens. Since the red pill I can't really see women as a source of inspiration or a long term investment anymore, because of how their own emotions trick them, because of how quickly things can end with them when Someone better than you comes around. The nature of relationships and love revealed make me unintentionally despise and cynically look down on their natures in a way. I have more success than ever with them, I should be glad but concluding all the AWALT behavior has darkened my outlook for the last years.Have you had that also and got over it?"
none,I never understood why people hate considering another point of view so much. It's like something breaks in their brain when they are forced to see another perspective.Hell I'm happy when someone can teach me something new
none,Also people are less sincere than they were during adolescence and tend to lose track of what it means to be human as society slowly takes away part of our being and replaces it with conformity
none,"Like I don't want chicks to just act their behavior to me based on what they think I would like to see , probably growing tiresome in the process, and then be a completely different person with someone else. Is there a way to find that out?Also how can one encourage them being more natural?"
none,Im trying to get to the root of the problemIf a substantial percentage of sebderms also have a long second toe then the cause of the sebderm problem can be narrowed down to an inability to metabolize vitamin B6 correctly. It is said  to play a role or even cause itself both of those conditions

none,"Take any recent popular TV show - Vikings, The Witcher, Star Trek Picard, etcEvery episode is just a tiny piece of one larger story, which, by itself alone, is mostly boring to watch. A lot of times you find that nothing interesting is happening and useless moments such as a main character having a drink or going from point A to B are horribly  over emphasized just to seemingly„kill time. Then they get you slightly excited at the end to keep you unsatisfied and eager to wait another week for the next episode..Take the old Star Trek shows for expample: while there was a larger storyline each episode was still interesting in itself because it had its own central theme and cliffhangers. You can pick x episode watch it and have a proper experience."
none,"Especially in US culture people seem to have nothing better to do than make up some bullshit new trendy way to cause infighting in people like men vs women, vegans vs omnivores, encouraging diversity while at the same time categorizing people by white / non white, etc If people had actual struggles there would be no time for any of that chit"

none,"All that hype ramps up the sales the product even if it is sub par and makes developers lazy and unwilling to put effort in them , as well as fix the product if any issues arise,  because they can already count on guaranteed high sales after enough hype and a good advertising strategy.Example: Modern Warfare 2019"
none,"As in, does each episode have some kind of theme” or focal point / dealing with a central problem?While you had a timeline of events that stretch over the seasons each episode was still more or less a complete package” in and of itself,whereas in a lot of shows coming out recently individual episodes just seem like little pieces of a movie, in which some are only there to lead up to an event but are not actually amounting to any meaningful event on their own.It would help me to adjust the expectations I have for the show. Thanks guys"
none,anyone tried DHT blockers like finasteride or Saw Palmetto?Accutane?Since they curb sebum production they should tackle the source of seb dermatitis altogether.
none,"Disgust.I usually never have this sensation in a dream.It involved looking a my body  getting infested by some worm like parasites that would crawl beneath my skin and leave their tails hanging out.I had to pull them out one by one and grab them, just looking at them moving under my skin was disgusting and touching them required some courage.It also didn't really evoke any fear, since when I get scared I usually just wake up.But the process of removing these things seemed to drag on and onWhat to make of this? Thanks a lot"
none,Do they generally acknowledge and understand the fact that preselection and having a lot of options (I.e. being a slut) for females is not desirable as it is for men? And change their behavior?
none,Like do you actively ask uncomfortable questions that may reveal red flags or bring up other more sensitive topics?I tend to change the subject or acknowledge and dismiss  when some girl hints at me with information that I may interpret as a red flag or something that may be said just to evoke jealousy or anger in me That way they never get a reaction out of me.. at the same time you can't really get to know them
none,She was sharing her fetishes within minutes and giving tons of indication of being a total easy to lay hoe.Got to my place and now she's having second thoughts and wouldn't let me advance whatsoever so I just sent her home.Usually my experience with this type is that they literally never show LMR.She said it's due to her a recent breakup and she doenst wanna jump into it heads over heels but we all know that probably isn't the real reason.Any leads?
none,And why is it so prevalent since homosexual couples are not reproducing? Shouldn't it have disappeared?
none,I feel when you see each other more than once a week they grow too attached and bring up the talk earlier.What was you guys' frequency that kept them happy as plates the longest?
none,"Just saw my gf again after a being away for a month.. spent roughly 10hours total just smashing away, climaxing about 8 times in 24 hours.I feel tipsy somehow and a little drugged. Never expelled so much semen in this a time window like this.Are there any downsides?"
none,"And other sexy pictures sent to me on demand?On the one hand too much validation decreases attractionOn the other hand you wanna reinforce positive behavior.Edit:*seems like there is little consensus on what to do, every standpoint is in the comments.* 😆"
none,Since more endogenous testosterone is preserved to do the job of actual testosterone - bind to receptors in muscle tissue and increase protein synthesis - aka build muscle rather than being lost” as DHT which is only androgenizing but not anabolic?Am I missing something?Have you had more gains on some 5ar inhibitor?
none,"I was pissed at you but I have no right to be, so I'm trying to calm it down”When probed due to weird flaky behavior. When I ask to elaborate she doesn't respond"
none,In a confrontational way.I know you will advise me to ghost or next but I want to straighten her out a little and I don't care if it's via text or in personEdit: I'm somewhat passive aggressive myself and don't wanna counter her with more passive aggressiveness
none,"Sex is amazing with FWB,  Texts me all the time and gets more and more into me, finds out about plate 2 and just flakes or breaks as a result. Doesn't hit me up anymore, barely answers me, you know the drill.Obviously her finding out about plate two had something to do with that.Shouldn't she be more into me according to TRP instead of just breaking?And I haven't called her out on flaking thus far, I just gave up contacting he also. Is this the right move or should I talk shit out with her somehow.She is not a plate after all and I enjoy her for her company alone, sucks to be losing her like that."
none,Ask and Investigate?Also withdraw?Is there a general approach or does it depend individually
none,Obviously spilling your feelings and desires out to women is not good for your perceived attractiveness.TRP basics.But if I'm genuinely mad or happy about some behavior of her I can't always keep it to myself or should I?Say I'm in an LTR and my girl flirts with some guy in front of me or doesn't message me back or some shit.If I directly confront her about the shit she will be informed but also she knows it got to me.If I passively punish her by withdrawing or soft nexting she doesn't get insight into my emotions but also it's passive aggressive as fuck and she may not get why exactly I ghosted her.
none,How do you know wehter they can or cannot pair bond?
none,"And maintain it? I have the impression they respect me less as time goes on.I know this is my own fault and somewhere down the road I fuck up, just can't identify where.What behavior builds respect and what decreases it?"
none,"Plate of 1,5 years gets angry at me seeing pics of me with another chick and sort of” breaks it off with me. Childhood friend who knows her through me, who is a loyal dude in general, sees her only when I brought her along and they chat normally friendly but he didn't show signs of romantic interest in her.All three of us are at a party and I avoid her that night to be able to have some fun and not ruin my night with sour failed relationship bullshit.Get fucked up and have to lay down and in the distance I hear him hitting on her and attempting to take her home.I get told by friends about what's going on but brushed it off, defending him as he would never do such a thing. Later confront him about it and turns out it's true.I broke off contact for now and I'm mad because it feels like broken trust and overstepping a line to me.I did tell him though that I didn't have serious intentions with her.. but he never made it known to me that he wants her, so it took me by surprise.Am I In the Right here to be mad?Would You say I'm possessive or that I'm right and what he did is fucked up?"
none,"Once I finish I get exhausted and just wanna rest, but some of my plates seem kinda „energized, restless, although they seem pleased and happy. Another is just as exhausted as I am and also just wants to rest.Does them feeling wired mean I should have fucked them longer or that I suck in bed? Tbh I don't really care getting them off because they want sex anyway lol"
none,Every tendon in my body seems shorter and less flexible than the average person and family members.It's hindering me in my kickboxing because I can't kick high  no matter how much I stretch.
none,"Mainly by kissing, light biting or gripping. Not by any purposely violent acts.Seems many of them have not experienced it before,But I also don't get the impression they are really adverse to it.. Do you accidentally bruise them and how do your women react to it?"
none,"During the act and in the heat of the moment I barely even notice it but I really cannot control myself. these marks become really visible afterwards, sometimes even a little blood is drawn too. My current girl doesn't seem to mind but I don't want her so bruised every time.Please help 😌"
none,"This new plate of mine is practically begging me to lead in every interaction, never turns down anything I propose or ask her to to.It's extremely hot and I want to take absolute control outside of the bedroom too but I'm new to this type of girl.What's your experience in this, can You give a bro some advice?Is there something I have to take into consideration vs less submissive ones?Thanks"
none,I have a  friend”with a level of selflessness (in the bedroom and out) and good companionship really untypical for a girl and which really adds value to my life lately. But by the way she fucks I can tell her n count is probably off the charts.Now if I wanted to settle I know I would have more fun with her than another friend who is probably not slutty but also kind of dull and boring..
none,"*** this is optional, skip if tl;dr***I am the stoic asshole that does not care, does not reveal feelings and ignores them.. they give me the sex I want and I give them zero commitment , none of them.They do not figure me out and I never let them. Because my gut knows the second I do, their interest fades or they start playing me. I'm not certain they will, but I am.. afraid that they may. To be honest It's really fucking me. Deep down I realize I don't want to be just like this, this is not truly who I am. I have to receive and give affection to be satisfied no matter how much sex I get.Like, I want to ask them how their day was or how she feels, simply because I am curious.I want to tell them how stunning and amazing she is sometimes, just because sometimes she truly is.I want to let her know how glad and completed I am when I lay next to her amazing body that I just filled with my seed.I wish I could just let this guard down for  once with a girl and just have something real. Is it ever possible to be real about your own emotions without women fucking you over with them in the end?"
none,She's not causing any trouble buts it's scary af and crazy
none,"I don't want her to eventually catch the big feels because that will be the beginning of the end as I don't want an LTR. How to postpone this stage and keep it friendly only?And can these relations successfully work long term? Have these things worked for you or failed eventually?She's kind of a ride or die and doesn't want a real relationship, at least it's what she said.. Thanks guys"
none,"We all know there is always a slutty side in any woman. Whether thats hidden or exposed.We know what they will do unsupervised and in private, what some of their deepest fetishes are. I have seen women orgasm to the thought of getting choked out by multiple dicks at the same time , and various  extremely fucked up kinky shit. Show me ONE a woman who orgasms to the thought of being a good housewife and being loyal to her hard working hubby. Women are confined by societies dogma that they ought to be classy and civilized and chaste but they are all total sexual savages and freaks biologically.BP Men everywhere seem to go for the chaste good girl and idolize it to the highest level, they all want their loyal, loving, chaste, non AWALT unicorn.Even men on the Red Pill here seem to seek this type of fantasy. Even though they know more about women than BP men, even though they should know better. How many posts here are of half red pilled men pursuing their blue pill dream, their chaste LTR, their perfect unicorn.. Yes you spin plates and that's great, but what's your end goal most of the time? To vet for a „non-slutty one, a „good girl.I believe that seeking this type of woman is just another blue pilled goal. Don't you realize At their core no women truly is what you guys desire in a good girl anyway, it's all an act, a facade to try and appeal to you and to society but you never get to see the real thing, the real girl.I don't understand why You red pilled men don't absolutely embrace this, and a women's true nature and sexuality? How will a prude boring star fish ever be better than a passionate little slut?You will never enjoy the kinky Shit of your Most fucked up fantasies if you don't take that step,It is the only way you will know her for what she really is (also, like a recent post here said it's the only way to enjoy her full sexual capacity)and it will only way she will also deeply be happy."
none,To take plates / dates home?If I say something like you wanna come over and chill / spend the night /watch something?” It doesn't work often for me with some women.To increase the success I would just make the circumstances ideal to have her really close to my place or go out so late the only comfortable action is for her to get to my place.Should I just lead and command instead?It's hard and since am kind of a pleaser it doesn't really come natural
none,"I walkways wondered this.. when you have the suspicion or when a girl is outright mad, is it best to A. confront her with why she is acting differently B. Pretend you don't notice and don't talk about it / proceed as if nothing is going on Seems natural to just ask but you are then also falling in her frame no? Also she then knows she got into your head, reinforcing her behavior So what to do?"
none,Are there any give away signs? I can't find any sidebar material on it And is I.e. childhood abuse in and of itself a red flag? If so why?
none,Or just say something like the problem is within me since I have different needs blabla Technically making them aware of some of their red flags makes them change that if they want to keep you? 🤔 just an idea 
none,What pros and cons are in girls from this stock?I feel I could do whatever I want with her which is nice in a way.Are they suitable for anything serious though if the chemistry is right?
none,"And can the process be reversed?Also why do they always take more and more from you, want to see you more often every time, want to always take every interaction to some next level?Can this be held at a steady pace somehow?I'm honestly overwhelmed especially spinning 3+ plates Cheers friends"
none,Everyone knows an absent father or a shitty relationship with him is a major red flag But is every girl in this situation damaged beyond repair?Have any had long term success with one despite of that?
none,"I have have a plate I really like on a personal level.I noticed In social situations with other women she tends to lack this manipulative cunning quality that other girls have, and is often humiliated and walked over by other jealous, normal” women.I say jealous because she is easily a 8-9/10 and extremely polite, friendly.Other women seem to sense that she is somehow different to them and for example make these subtly insulting remarks but she never lowers herself to that level.I get the impression that it's a green flag of some kind but I want to know what you think? I feel I have to defend her sometimes, which I did once and she visibly liked."
none,Would you recommend the oral intake of Retinyacetate or Retinylpalmitate?Palmitate is soluble in fat and Acetate in Ethanol.Can the body actually utilize both equally well?
none,"Personally I used to before TRP and now well not so much. Good, honorable demeanor I highly respect but a girl has to display these attributes first, for I found it seems a foreign concept for many, especially when young.I live in Germany and see them shamelessly walking over men, using them, belittleling and intriguing them everywhere and cannot help but despise it all.For example I find myself not being able to effectively do group tasks with a lot of them at the work place either. There seems always drama, cunning, power play elements involved, where as a group of dudes can simply chill and get things done How do you reconcile your red pilled awareness of the female mentality and western societies narrative to treat them as equals everywhere?"
none,"Plate was pleasuring me after had some meaningless conversation but suddenly stops when she sees that I enjoy it, with a sudden change of heart, I see how she was about to make some demand of me of ask me a question and I reinforced her to speak up but she ended up not voicing it and also stopped pleasuring me.She is 19, can be really submissive but is also a bit bratty. She is at a stage where she is really close to giving me „the talk Btw.So obviously blue balled I tried to keep it cool and didn't act butthurt but since I  recently don't really see value in her other than pleasuring me she, she no longer had any use and was just laying next to me, so I politely sent her home saying I got shit to do."
none,what the fuck is up with the female psyche that makes them adore *murderers*?Especially when his victims were fucking women?Dying for some in depth explanation for this twisted shit..
none,"If so, how did it happen"
none,What's up with chicks who don't like silent moments between conversations? It seems to unnerve them to a degree men don't understand. Same when you don't emote muchAny psychological explanations?
none,I'd like to reduce oily skin / shedding but using saw palmetto or finasteride gives me ED and low motivation.Is there a way to retain testosterone but get rid of the other androgenic effects in the skin?Having some success with Zinc / vitamin A but it's only a slight improvement.Thanks!
none,
none,"I accidentally made my lately aloof and indifferent  plate really long for me and eager to see me, simply by instigating some emotion in her. After a bit of banter I kinda convinced her via text that she misses me. She wouldn't say it by herself first so I probed for it a bit and told her how good her lips tasted to me last time I didn't expect much of it but she basically did a 180 and turned really affectionate just like that. Met soon afterwards and had great sex, I believe it def. played a part.What's the mechanism behind what happened and How can you make use of this?Obviously complementing all the time and becoming overly emotional yourself is mostly damaging so why did it work in this case?Let me know your own experiences"
none,"Is your mom not supposed to be the first and primary woman you can trust with your woes and thoughts?Cause since I was young I always had my vulnerabilities that I carefully and in good hope and trust revealed to her used against me in some later dispute. Just like it happens in some partnership.I felt no consideration, no honor, no true empathy on her side really.She never felt like an „ally of mine, just somebody who will find out my weaknesses just to hit me where it hurts most."
none,"asked to join me for dinner after spending some time together, declines.I go by myself and as soon as we separate she texts messages gauging my emotions like If i made you feel left out sorryyyy but I'm full” and something like  you probably wish I was with you?”  amongst other things.Of course I didn't take the bait and just negged a bit and left it at that. But what's actually going on? Shit test? comfort test? "
none,"Srsly brothers.I see a lot of your posts here where the chick in the interaction says things like „come and fuck me „ I like this / that /I like you „ Even though I have good success in plating I am never on a level where they state their desires directly.For example when I have the impression she is horny / in the mood  I make a move and it happens but none openly say what they want / when they want.I do get great sex and all but It would turn me on a lot more and make the sex more interesting if they actually were more vocal about their lust so I want them to be that.I've been told I am somewhat impersonal sometimes, so do they just mirror my behavior?Thanks ✌️"
none,"Already tried iron,copper, selenium, iodine."
none,"Say you are constricted by an LTR but you meet a good new potential chick. You know your LTR isn't gonna last forever. If your SMV is high, is it generally possible?Was thinking along the lines of dangling the carrot with flirting and some banter.Did that generally work for you?"
none,it's not like it will necessarily make her more attractive and why is it especially common in damaged girls? 
none,"If I immerse myself in the act and make it pleasurable I nut quickly.Unless I busted already the same day The only way to make it last is If I suppress my arousal by thinking about some serious shit.Wtf is wrong with me lmao. It's like I can't control my arousal at all, especially when it's a really hot chick or a position I really like.Anyone have similar Experiences?"
none,"I spin 3 plates but developed a semi oneitis for a particular one.I can be my careless, red pilled self with any girl except for her. I find it extremely difficult not to slip back into beta behavior with her.She unknowingly has a complete grip on my emotional world, but from what I learned here I will never be permitted to reveal any of this. It is slowly eating away at me and I don't know what to do.Here's something interesting:Even though she is beautiful inside and out she shows many red flags and I know from a logical assessment she wouldn't be good for me in the long run.She isn't available all the time either and doesn't shower me in affectionate behavior in the same way some plates do. I fall for her to the very principles we use to attract girls basically.In a way I feel like the girl attracted to the alpha, only that it's a chick.Is something wrong with me? Can you relate? Pls help"
none,Everyone experiences setbacks that inevitable darken mood.To which extent do you reveal them to your plates/ ltrs.. Let me know your experiences..
none,Experiences?
none,So I have the impression with most of my colleagues and people around me I behave much more agreeable than I want to be and have to appease to them because most can't seem to really take my banter and playfulness well. I prefer to be direct and sincere and that's how I'd like to be treated myself.I hold back a lot in fear of alienating people. My persona works with creating attraction with chicks but not so much in the social circles of colleagues. (In my Defence most of them don't even lift lol)I don't consider myself  tactless or rude but it seems I can only have that style of interaction with my best friends.Is this because I'm a pussy or is it because people in my circles are too sensitive?Can anyone relate or possibly help a brother out?
none,"Extremely hot, 19 years young. I'm 24.Father died when she was 7.I know girls in this circumstance tend to be more unstable and slutty, anything else to consider?Experiences?Let me know"
none,"I noticed some rather unpleasant changes in mine, She's definitely more whiny, bitchy and somehow acquisitive. It could be that this simply happend because she got used to me but The onset was strangely tied the pills introduction. What are your experiences?"
none,"Saw my plate today, went to a bar and I had the impression she tries to comfort me a bit more than usual. Always snuggling up to me and showing some horniness. I returned it a bit but was a bit thrown off and became a little suspicious to the point where I withdrew a bit.Been seeing each other for 4 months now and usually meet once a week. Frequent sex. gave me ""the talk"" sort of, managed to sort of dodge it too.She has male orbiters."
none,"I'd like to spend as little time on there as possible, Facebook is already enough for me many of my firends use snapchat/Instagram and urge me to get that too.. I'd prefer not to"
none,"so the bitch (18,F) I (23, M) kept as a plate for about three months now is behaving irritating lately.  (We did have sex many times already)crazy mood swings, increased disrespectful behavior ( i.e playfully calling me ""bitch"" in some joke), shit tests left and right, her all around changes in behavoir can be described as turning more erratic, unbalanced, whacko, childish, selfish even.I sense that lately she really tries to get under my skin by trying to provoke jealousy and other negative emotions that would make me appear weak. perhaps to assess how I react?In the beginning she was submissive and not a pain the ass at all.The behaviour she shows is what you would typically see when a girl gets too comfortable or the man she is with is a beta, in my case though I pay close attention that I dont behave lke that at all. I don't pay her drinks, I don't take her home to her door, I don't indicate symptoms of oneitis (there are other girls I see), I don't  text her first nor respond early, and so on.The only thing I can think of  this is I seem to be showing more physical affection than many men do to their spouses, but just because I like to and not really out of neediness.When being teased or tested it's always been Agree and Aplify or withdrawal of attention but never anything butthurt or even irritated. Not once have I let her win an emotional power playOh and about two months ago she started taking oral birth control and I can't help but think that there is a connection because her starting to take it marked the begininng of these issues more or less.My questions for You dear people are:* what the fuck is happening here?* should I already next her?* what are your experiences with girls starting with BC pills?* would this have happened without her hopping on it?PS: I don't really care for for her that much I just want to know why things are happening the way they do  so I can learn for the future."
none,The idle cherry blossom effect for Kensei has no soundPlease add it! It's so... peaceful 
none,"So, basically, I've been smoking cigarillas recently and some tobacco, rolled up in paper. And you know what? I have no anxiety, even more relaxation when I used to smoke cigarettes. Also, with cigarettes I had more anxiety, than relaxation. Also, I've marked that inhalation in lugs gave me anxiety and even exhaling it via nose was quite repugnant to me... But when I tried some cigarillas... I liked them. And still like. Even exhaling this smoke through my nose is quite pleasant. Inhaling it in lungs, obviously is quite detrimental, because you know why. But the state of being after smoking of some cigarilla... I feel content, euphoric. It resembles some opioid high, though light. I don't know, if I knew this, I wouldn't have smoked cigarettes at all, because they taste like shit and the cigarette high is totally disgusting. But cigarilla... it's awesome. I recommend to quit cigarette and replace them with cigarillas. I smoke 1 or 2 cigarillas per day and it's enough. But with cigarettes... it's like compulsive redosing every hour, plus additional anxiety that I personally don't like at all. Anyway, cheers."
none,"You know, today I've been thinking about teeth, calcium depletion, caffeine and got an odd thought, don't whether is it deception or not. But, the thought is like a question, ""is it possible that teeth can be decreased in size while being caffeinated?"". And, you know, I don't know, but I have a feeling that maybe my teeth were bigger and stronger, than now. However, sadly, I didn't make photos of my teeth in the past. So, I can't compare whether this is true or not. Because, you know, if I had even one picture of my teeth in the past, I could have compared them with my today's teeth. And I'm not sure entirely, whether they can be decreased in its size. However, if this is true — it can be a proof why teeth suffer during caffeination. The saddest part of this, I can't prove that this is legit, however this thought haunts me a bit. The only thing I know, that teeth can be destroyed with cavities, for instance.  You know, hypothetically, if there is calcium depletion and suffering of teeth, there should be the mechanism of its depletion. And, taking calcium from the teeth, depleting them and decreasing its size... this statement may be quite logical. Also, some studies have something about ""calcium depletion"". The main parts of the body, where calcium can be found, are bones and teeth. The main parts of the body. So, logically there may be something in it.Anyone had such thoughts? Any ideas? Discussion? Any discussion is appreciated."
none,"So, basically, I had 3 packs of different herbs — chamomile (50 g), valerian (50 g) and mint (50 g). In all three cases I ground those herbs, than mixed it with one glass of sugar (\~250 ml). So, first of all, I want to say, that the best taste I got from the valerian kombucha, I liked its taste very much. Plus, it is quite a good sedative stuff. The next kombucha, chamomile, I had problems with it, due to that long filtering. However, in the end of it all, its taste was the second after the valerian one, you may like it. Third and the last, mint. It has some particular taste, so beware. So, all those kombuchas can be brewed, so if you want — try them. However, I recommend to try to make a valerian one, because it has quite a good taste and it is awesome.I just forgot to post about it a month ago, but today I remembered that I haven't done it, so here is my report. Hope I've given you some new idea of brewing. Cheers and enjoy your drinks!"
none,"So, basically, when I used caffeine to enhance my physical activity when I ran or did sports, I found out that it might look like ""yeah, it enhances activity"", though if you take a proper look at this, it doesn't help to do physical activity properly, because you'll become tired quit fast, than you're off caffeine. I became faster tired, when I used caffeine. Like, it may look that it helps, though this energy for a run drains so quickly, that when you ran 1/3 of the distance, you'd feel tiredness. Off caffeine — I run almost with the same speed, so tiredness, if I experience, may be up to the end of running. So, basically, my thought is that it's pointless to use caffeine as an ""aid"" to help with physical exercises. Better not to rely on caffeine, because tiredness would come faster and you'd be tired. Also, additional stress factors add to this matter. So, double draining, I'd say. Especially if someone comes to some gym, working out with anxiety, plus faster tiredness... and later you'd be even double tired, if you're caffeinated. Without caffeine I don't experience that ""double-tiredness"". Two-fold tiredness on caffeine or something. Don't know how to say it otherwise. So, basically, I've found it out handy (is it right? the opposite of ""in handy"") to use caffeine as a physical perfomance enhancing drug. Also, additional dehydration, that is a bit unpleasant thing. So, that's it for now."
none,"Found out another benefit of caffeine-free life. Almost no sweat in most of the situation, apart from where can be some physical activitiy. On caffeine I almost always sweat, even just common walking to the nearest shop to buy something. And yeah, I've quit using deodorants, probably because I sweat less. Funny thing that there are deodorants which ""inhibits"" release of sweat from my pores. This things seems to me a bit hilarious now in some sense. That's it for now, cheers."
none,"Recently I've started to speak with some girl in some app, even with close topics. Though, really, I feel like I'm being attached too fast. How do you deal with those issues? Why that attachment happens? I fear attachment, really. And even had an urge to run away, which I did already. I don't know, those triggers, like fear that I would be left or something, fear of losing myself. And I don't like that attachment. You know, if I write here, on reddit, probably there would be several responses, just superficial changing of thoughts or something, though may be important. I'm fine with this style of speaking, though I'm afraid of going deeper. Probably, I'm not sure even how it is done, I just forgot it after that narc exposure. I started even prefer more solitude, than those social webs. Reddit doesn't count, because I don't speak quite often with people. Just sharing, not deep. And social webs sometimes are felt like they are draining, sticking to them like some kind of glue did this. Maybe, there are some codependent issues, which I haven't touched yet? Also, I've marked that I have some weird pattern, to stick to people whom I don't even know. It's weird, pretty weird. I've spoken with that girl, but myself found that it's weird to share deep things, though I don't know her. However, it doesn't matter, because I was under pseudonym, because she won't know who I really am. And yeah, as I've said in another post, I still struggle with philophobic thing, so as with fear of intimacy. At the same time I find it weird, that I shared my issues. Here I can do this, because obviously community is welcome here, and we have something in common. Though, with not known girl... Strange. Too fast. Can anyone give me a hint, what should I take my glance at? What matter I've overlooked? Any ideas?"
none,"So, basically, on caffeine and decaf I feel the same patterns of my problems/issues. For instance, on caffeine you may experience strong sociophobia, though off caffeine you may be not social at all, however yearning for some connection. In my case, for instance, I still experience philophobia off caffeine, the same thing I experience on caffeine, though is more amplified and panicky, that I want to run away. So, basically, you'd feel the same issues either on caffeine, or on decaf. You can't mask them, they would find you out eventually. Your hyperreactions on caffeine are important to journal, because they point it out to your problems that should be solved. Caffeine as self-medication takes place, when someone wants to be busy and run away from his/her problems. That's why in the end, it ends up in compulsive redosing. And lots of anxiety, fears, etc. During decaf, those issues would you reach anyway, though may be in a bit weakened state of being. I think, it is important to take a look what's behind this addictive behavior. Because any addiction is like running away from some particular problem/issue. Like a computer game may be an urge to run away from reality, because it hurts. There is something behind this matter, try to take a look at it. And take a look at what you fear during caffeine stages, if you're in them. It is important. Because I haven't seen any difference between caffeinated and decaffeinated lives, if we speak about problems/issues or even traumas. The only difference, on decaf they're weaker. However, in the end, decaf is a way to go. And problems eventually should be solved. Even insomnia in some sense may be an indicator that something is going on wrong in one's life. Just it is necessary to observe and journal, answers would be found eventually."
none,"I don't know really, whether I had those things prior to that narc or is it the consequence of that narc exposure. However, after it I started to feel quite philophobic, like I can easily speak with those who aren't pretty for me, hence there is no any spark. I even remember that prior to narc I tried to have relationships, though hadn't had that anxiety or phobia towards any thought about this. But now... full-blown understanding that I've become a philophobe. I ran away every time if I feel that there is something ""lighted on"" in me. After that narc I even started to become quite secluded, even my attire started to become not that colorful or beautiful. Social webs also were turned off. I don't really know, what to do. I even feel that I run away from any job, due to that possible falling in love. I used to do this. After that narc I never even thought about this matter. I even had a job. Now, I'm in the void, sometimes even afraid to go outside, because obviously it is summer (almost) and lots of anxiety. I even wake up either early or when there is no one outside. Can you imagine that? I remember how I went step by step to this after withdrawing from narc, like hiding myself from the world. I'm almost a hikikomori. And I'm lost, at least for now. I don't know, really, whether these things are the consequences of only that narc, or that thing wasn't unresolved since my puberty. I know that I've become that secluded man after that narc, even my interactions with people were quite superficial and temporary.Who is going through the same stage as me right now? I want to know that I'm not alone in this thing, because sometimes I feel quite sad and forlorn. I just don't know what to do, I'm stuck. The only thing I'm happy about is that I'm free from that narc, that only humiliated me. First time I passed through the 1 year mark. First time.edit: I even gained weight after that narc. Same thing. Like defense against any relationship. Like I myself did this to me, just to be un-loved. Creepy thing, really. Never thought that after-narc exposure may result in such a frightening trauma."
none,"So, basically, you know that caffeine turns you up into that alert state of mind, which makes you react in various situations more often with anxious attitude or something like that. Or passive aggressiveness, in some situations. So, basically, if you know that this constant stress is lingering on without any disruption, you can't deal with any trauma. How can you deal with traumas if you're in the stress state of mind? You're not capable of doing this, at all. That's why lots of people spoke about this matter, like ""processing trauma"" during decaffeination. Because obviously they can't process this during stressful lifestyle, caffeinated lifestyle. Not even reminding that caffeinated state is quite restrictive in terms of emotions, more robust and raw emotions, that aren't capable of delving deep at all, only physical interaction. That's why decaffeinated lifestyle is only capable of dealing with traumas, because you don't experience stress, which helps to traumas and problem things emerge from inside. So, keep on going, you're doing fine. And, on caffeine, eventually, those ""anxiety things"", thouse related emotions just reach up some point, that it is almost impossible to deal with caffeine addiction. It just shows that ""self-medication with caffeine"" doesn't work anymore. And it was self-medication, just to run away from processing those ""uncomfortable things"" from your life. At the same time, those stressful events on caffeine can even add up something else to ill things that you've already experienced. So, keep on going. That's what I've wanted to say. Cheers."
none,"So, basically, I wanted to restore my sleep patterns. You know, if someone abstains from caffeine for even a week, he/she can get high on it. Ironically, in /drugs people mocked me, saying ""ha-ha, getting high on caffeine"". You know, really caffeine is recreational, though it's magic screwed with daily usage. That's why lots of abhorrence towards it, due to phaarmacological tolerance, plus daily usage has no that effect as you it in some ceremonial way. Even psychedelics are not supposed to be used daily. So, basically, I was stimulated for the whole day, even more. Caffeine is definitely a reacreational drug, though is not supposed to be used in a way that people use every day. Its effects are weaker and with ill-colored nature.So, speaking about the nature of caffeine. You remember that ""three brains idea"" (triune brain)? Like reptillian brain, mammalian brain and neo-cortex? So, basically, caffeine works predominantly in the ""reptillian brain area"", hence we see most often responses like instincts, also here aggression and some tension sometimes occur. Plus, the same well-known ""hostility"" in various forms, be it verbal or physical. At the same time, we see some emotional restriction to some degree. And emotions are not deep, more superficial. However, some emotional reactivities in terms of ego are seen, like ""you said something wrong, I'm angry"", ""I'm right you wrong"" and others like this situations. Or ""you insulted me"" even when there was nothing like that. Like emotional brain serves to reptillian brain, though reptillian brain is not right in some cases. At the same time, neo-cortex here is just for the serving of the first one, too. Like, do you remember how someone says ""he provoked me to do this/that""? Like acts of self-justification, etc. If you take a look closely at those things, you'd see that this thing really happens. Or various rationalizations. So, basically, caffeination is just turning on that reptillian brain and it works the most during caffeination, hence those reactions in caffeine users.Without caffeine there is some balance between those reactions, plus emotions are more deeper and not reactive at all. Thinking process are also more deep, structurilzed and really ""calm"" I'd say. Not that reactive thinking on caffeine.So, basically,  as all herbs, things should be used in their proper time, not daily. And my experience only proves me once again that daily usage only screws any magic of things. And, personally, I don't think that I'm interested in caffeine at all. I just used to repair my schedule, that's it. And it worked good, especially when I worked physically hard, not laying on my couch or sitting near my computer, scrolling reddit or something else. So, I was busy yesterday. In the end I don't think I would get back, because I've known lots about caffeine and it's enough. Calmness is way better, if you've experienced it and liked it.edit: link triune brain:[https://soulguru.com/triune-brain/](https://soulguru.com/triune-brain/)"
none,"Restore your sleep patterns. I'm now at almost 2 weeks withdrawn from caffeine, however I forgot to ""repair"" my sleep schedule. And the last 2 weeks I wake up in the day/evening and go to sleep in the morning. This is horrible. I'm not even sure that I get the necessary sleep, which I suppose to get in the night. Also, today I have headaches that are quite uncomfortable. I had those already, when I was awake in the night with that weird sleep schedule. Don't know about others, but for me I've understood, that night, though may be a peaceful time, however being awake in the night isn't good for me. Also, I'm still fat, so probably being awake during the night has something, related to obesity. I even sure, that if I restore my sleep patterns, that fat belly would go away. Anyway, suppose it was a healthy reminder to you. At least, food for thought.edit: forgot to add that I even have not that much dreams, that I had (and have) when I sleep at night. I've spoken this because caffeine screws this thing, i.e. sleep routine/schedule."
none,"Has anyone studied this matter? I think the slow thinking may be due to less acetylcholine on decaffeinated state of life, because obviously ingesting information during withdrawal is really hard, as remembering it deeply. I've found some paper ' affeine enhances acetylcholine release in the hippocampus in vivo by a selective interaction with adenosine A1 receptors"".[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7752065/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7752065/)So, maybe that slow thinking and some kind of weakened remembering is just a less acetylcholine cause. Because how otherwise can it be described? I think it's logical in some sense, if some, obviously, has nothing to add to it. I suppose any idea about this matter may be interesting. I think it shed light on the matter of ""slow thinking & problems with processing and remembering of the information""."
none,"Weird. The first five days were quite easy. On the 6th day I started fasting for 48 hours. And, you know, today, I still feel something like I experienced when I'd been withdrawing successfully for 7 days. It's like I feel calm, relaxed, though there is something lacking. At the same time it is a pleasure for me to lay on my couch. Today I predominantly have been laying on my couch, starring at the top of my room. Don't know, just apathetic being for today. Something bothers me, like ""no-action"", no-doing. At the same time I really don't care about anything. At the same time I feel like I'm lacking some purpose in life. Also, today, during jogging I've found out that I've been most of my life in the state of dissociation. Like, for instance, I can run outside, however I barely feel reality outside. And, for sure, most of time I'm in my head. On caffeine this state of being was also dominant, however with additional stress dissociation became like ""feeling that I'm not here"". I'm not sure whether should I feel ""the world outside"" or stay in my head. On caffeine those feelings were just enhanced — lots of dreaming, anxious dissociations from uncomfortable situations, etc. And I don't know really, whether this thing was only on caffeine or caffeine with something else. And now, the seventh day, I feel the same like that prior effort, though I'm not that sad, I'm just... I don't care about anything. And at the same time that numbness makes me afraid. And this thing I'm experiencing now, on the 7th day, withdrawing. Maybe, this is some kind of a life crisis, apart from caffeine withdrawal?"
none,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVg2bfqblGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVg2bfqblGI)Personally, I relate to this, because I've had problems with emotions and caffeine just ""holds me"" and its grip is the primal reactions of the brain, i.e. reptilian brain. Other stimulants, like amph does the same thing, i.e. being robotic and un-emotional in some sense. And this vid just a good showing what's going on behind addictions. Especially, if some scrolls down this sub to see how some people digest incredibly huge amount of caffeine."
none,"You know, the first tiem she had compared me to her ex, even about ""their song"" and other crap. And she sometimes used this loophole as a weapon against me, like she felt that I reacted to it. And you know, even five years later (a year ago) she used the same thing once again (!). You know, I don't like either the song, no her and her hookups. How to stop reacting this way? I understand that it is ""her problems"", ""her words"" and other matters. But why am I reacting this way? What problem should be solved in this matter? What lesson should learned from my reaction to that? I know mentally that it's bollocks and I don't want to be the way she likes, because obviously she will never be satisfied, like most narcs are. On which thing should I pay attention to? Which matter should I resolve? The only thing I know for now is this is just an emotional response and I felt it several times.edit: title ""compared to"" instead of ""comparing with"". My bad."
none,"You know, first of all, caffeine in majority of people are introduced in early childhood (I remember how my brother took the first sip of caffeinated tea when he was 2 years old). So, basically, if we've been caffeinated since childhood, it means that our further life and life experiences, including various traumatic events, problems, fallings-in-love also happened in that state. Also, the state of mind was predominantly caffeinated, hence reactions are through the prism of caffeine. And that vigilant state of mind in its additional and unnecessary alertness has been since childhood. So, what I wanted to say by that? Obviously, all the things happened in majority of lives are made in the caffeinated state of mind, including traumas, etc, etc. So, basically the ""real you"" was suppressed altogether in the childhood, when parents introduced that beverage to you. And I want to stress on the last sentence, because it sounds terrible, when comprehending of this happens in one's mind. Altered chemistry, altered reactions, altered life and lots of altered things. Probably, lots of craziness in this world can be directed to the fact, that **most of people ""suppress their own self"" since their childhoods**. As you know, in psychiatry and psychology, suppression leads to the vice-versa effects, like enhancing of the suppressed things. Like, if you suppress your sexuality — it may take its form in the compulsiveness — be it either porn or excessive fantasizing about ""count number of hookups"". So, suppression of life leads to the ongoing consequences, be it either mental distress or other disturbances. No wonder some take their glance on the alcohol or various drugs. You know, personally, caffeinated mind is a terrible stress, because it is a restless state of mind, without any relaxation. I know what I'm saying. And the only thing that gave me relief and some ease when I was caffeinated — some tobacco, because it helped. However, I think this is not the right way, also. I just took some pause from this sub and tried to look deeper in myself and found out aforementioned insight, which I want to share with you. That's why it's harsh to quit caffeine. The whole life was on caffeine. That's why uncertainty about almost everything. That's why mental distress and misery. An attempt to start real life, at least to take a look at what may be further. Cheers."
none,"You know, today I've been reading some book on psychiatry after some post here, in this sub. And, interestingly enough, found out that narcs in some manner react sadistically to those who fall in love with them. And, at the same time, it is stated in the book, that this aggression and hostility is like a reaction towards this feeling. Like defense mechanism which is shown in the form of hatred, hostility and other cruelty. And, also, I've found there (in the book) that sadism is connected with sexual immaturity. And you know, those parts of the book that I've read, is really look what I experienced in the real life with that narc. Hating of any possible ""warmth"" in the terms of feelings? Yes, it is. Inferiority, concealed by aggression? Yes. At the same time they pretend to be like normal people. They can have lots of people, lots of hookups, though in terms of ""going further"", deeper, they're more often wouldn't go that way. Promiscuity? It may be, though there would be no love. So, chasing the narc is a terrible idea, because they're ""out-or-order"". My narc only thought about sex and nothing else. And when I confessed about my love, she got infuriated. And this is interesting, because it just showed me that she hates this feeling, hence defense against it in any form necessary. So, abandon all your hopes, because any other approach would logically end up the same, i.e. turning on defense mechanism in the narc. So, don't waste your time. **The problem is not in you, but in narc, who turns on defense mechanism against any ""deep feeling"", especially love.**"
none,"You know, weirdly, the same question arose in my mind like, ""why was I that addicted to that narc?"". At the same time it is a weird addiction, like odd compulsion and a stupid one. Sometimes I wonder, whether this thing resembles the same thing like gamblers experience. Like some kind of insobriety and inebriation and, at the same time, like a person can't control oneself. I even remembered how ""I should have been always with that person"". Fear of losing someone? It's weird. I remember even how I used to forget about myself during those encounters. The problem is that even if I fall in love with someone new, I'd experience the same thing. Like... why am I so ""glued"" to another person? It's like some kind of a wish to control another person and fear of losing her. How did you, people, solve this problem? You know, after that narc I'm not even sure how to love, really. And even don't know, how much should I spend with someone, at all. And honestly, I'm frightened about another possible encounter of falling in love. This compulsion thing a bit bothers me, really. Where's the line between being fine and too needy? You know, in such cases I even think that being alone is a lot easier, than to play those ""games"". That's why I'm a bit ""entrapped"" and ask for some insight. I'm on the right path, though some clues are absent for now. How you solved that riddle, if you'd had this one?"
none,"Have someone here ""played with this plant""? Is it handy on its own? I've heard that it can be used in ayahuasca rituals. Is this herb interesting on its own? Or only in combinations with psychedelics?"
none,"You know, I've tried common cigarillas that are made from Nicotiana tabacum and felt just good. Though, when I tried some cheap Nicotiana rustica — I felt amazing, even extremely drowsy. I've not delved that deep into that matter, though common wiki just states that Nicotiana rustica contains more nicotine, than Nicotiana tabacum. Also, cigarillas made of Nicotiana tabacum should be smoked more, than N. rustica. I mean, when I smoke ""rustica"" it requires less for me to be smoked, relaxed I mean (ha-ha). Sometimes even when I smoke rustica — it's like a perfect stuff for relaxing and, at the same  time, it is in handy to be smoked prior to sleep, because it can be used as a sleep aid. Anyone tried these two types of tobacco? What about your experiences? You know, personally, I think Nicotiana rustica can be a perfect addition to ""herbalist kit"".Also, on wikipedia it is stated that it contains (N.rustica)  beta-carbolines, including the harmala alkaloids harmane and norharmane. I think this may be interesting for some, also. I haven't delved too deep into those matters, I'm just into practical approach to those things for now. So, any thoughts and opinions are welcome."
none,"The first thing I see that it is not burnt, so it is definitely easier to consume, i.e. there is no ""burning sensations"". However, I wonder about its effect (snus). Is it the same as smoking tobacco or even stronger? I want to ask because need some insight about this. I see it is in handy, because it isn't smokable (I mean there is no inhaling of hot temperature smoke). Also, what about effects? Any difference? More nicotine per pouch?"
none,"So, haven't been here for some time and recently just taken a look at the matter. You know, this sounds wierd, but lots of similarities are there between her and me. And at the same it doesn't work. Not that I'm sad about it, but the only thing that wonders me, that it's like we have the same lessons and problems throughout our lives. I've scrutinized almost everything, up to the psychological problems. She's just the mirror of my problems, i.e. she has the same problems that I have, though in different forms, though in essence they are the same. From everything I know, starting from sexual life, first falling in love, problems with love, etc, etc. Even addictions, promiscuity, etc. I mean, I know that there are lots of similarities and it is a bit shocking, really. I just wanted to write somewhere about this and haven't found any place, except this sub.Also, can anyone recommend me some movie about this matter? Like ""similar fates""? However, that's not exact what I need. It's more similar experiences and problems. And weirdly that people with similar problems ""collide"". I don't want to romanticize too much on this matter, I'm just looking for some clues, really."
none,"You know, I tried mint, valerian, chamomile and every one of them worked pretty good. Recently, I've discovered hops and eventually, I've liked it. Don't know how popular here it is, though it is an interesting plant. I've smoked it, by the way. I'd put it in the same row as chamomile and mint. Valerian isn't that smokable, really, so I'd put it out of it. Also, interesting fact that hops is from the same family as weed. Anyway, interesting find."
none,"Last record:[https://www.reddit.com/r/nutmeg/comments/mfl8me/reports\_about\_my\_nutmeg\_kombucha\_almost\_2\_weeks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutmeg/comments/mfl8me/reports_about_my_nutmeg_kombucha_almost_2_weeks/)So, in my whole brew there is almost no alcohol. It tastes, though a bit acidic, than sugary. I'd recommend to drink it when it reaches up to 2 weeks brew and it tastes quite good, though with more brewing it tastes a bit harsher. You know, like vinegar, thus hard to digest.So, my conclusion: it works well, it can be used up to the mark of 1 month of brewing it. So, 2 weeks of brewing is the perfect mark. So, I want to admit that this experiment is done and it's really great. Try it some day, you may like it.So, I hope this experiment was in handy for this sub. So, cheers!edit: also, I don't know whether its potency can be equalled to eating nutmegs alone. However, I'm sure that this beverage can be used as a tonic, because obviously it gives some mood-boost. I'm definitely feel better after drinking it. I've drunk today nearly 1 litre or something like that and it can be felt. So, further experiments may need just for the comparison of the brew itself and eating them alone."
none,"I'm just wondering whether some experience something like this. After I quit narc, I started becoming obese. Up to this day I had tons of weight, like I've never prior to these circumstances had so much weight. And I don't even know how to get rid of that weight for now. I don't know, like food has become my defense or something like that. And I can assuredly say that it happened a half a year ago or something like that. So, anyone experiencing obesity? If so, how you got rid of it?"
none,"You know, I've tried smoking common cigarettes and even pure organic tobacco, and tobacco that is sold in smoke shops, cigarillas, etc. Cigarettes seem to be anxiety-provoking, though when I smoke pure tobacco or cigarillas, I experience either relaxation or an urge to puke (probably due to inhalation in the lungs). My question is: are there any other usages of tobacco? For instance, making my own blend or something? I know that some use it as an addition to ayahuasca brew. I know that tobacco is some weak MAOI, though I'm not sure how can I use it otherwise. I know that tobacco itself gives me some relaxation, though it is a bit inebriating, like sedation with some ""mixed thoughts"", relaxation with some dumbness, if it is possible to say so."
none,"You know, I see it coming in several waves — sometimes everything goes well, sometimes I even feel like I've fallen to the bottom. And it is really painful now, some dark stage. I do and try to do at least something and it works. Last year I just craved it, but now I'm just feeling tired and a bit empty. The only question I want to ask — how much in average people require to overcome all this matter? A year? I'm just curious. And at the same time I'd like to know some patterns of ""overcoming"". Like, you know, first time you relapse, the second time it may be something different, several stages and in the end it ends, because there is no need in it. At least, mentally and spiritually one has changed."
none,"So, continuing my topic, I want to share my observations about this matter.[https://www.reddit.com/r/nutmeg/comments/mbz24c/so\_day\_4th\_report\_about\_my\_nutmeg\_kombucha/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutmeg/comments/mbz24c/so_day_4th_report_about_my_nutmeg_kombucha/)So, first, effect can be really felt. I tried several times, first time one cup 200-250 ml and the second time 2 cups (200-250 ml x 2). Basically, I felt some minor mood lift and it can be felt within an hour or something. How could I find this out? I just felt difference between a ""no nutmeg day"" and a ""day with nutmeg brew"", especially that feeling with some problems in concentration matters. So, yes, it works. Also, it is easy to drink it without any negative feelings.Also, some pics:[https://ibb.co/r4b1FYY](https://ibb.co/r4b1FYY)[https://ibb.co/X4QBr9L](https://ibb.co/X4QBr9L)Sorry, I got no imgur. As you can see, it works, even new scoby is growing. And, forgot to add, that I used common scoby from the black tea brew. With black tea brew all kombuchas are made, because if you use kombucha from, for instance, coffee, it may be spoiled. I once did this and my brew turned into something that contained alcohol.And now, my nutmeg kombucha taste good, I mean it is not an alcohol drink. However, I'm going to continue just to see whether it is gonna be spoiled (turned into an alcohol beverage). So, basically, if some doesn't like the taste of nutmeg, they can use this method, i.e. brewing kombucha with nutmeg. Hope this was interesting. Cheers!edit: forgot to add, that there is some nutmeg sediment on the bottom of the jar. However, everything is still fine up to this day."
none,"I'm that anon who posted not long ago about kombucha. First, receipe: I ground 6 nutmegs into powder, 1 glass of white sugar, boiled water. Mixed it up, filtered that nutmeg & sugar solution, put it into the jar (3 l, 2,5 l of solution). Put scoby when it cooled down. So, no mold, basically. New scoby started to grow up. And now I'm tasting that brew, that I've done. It tastes quite pleasant, at least I don't have any repugnant feelings towards that nutmeg, to its taste. I think sugar makes it easier to ingest. At the same moment, during taking several sips I feel some minor feelings in the body. I don't know, that state of... feelings (?) can be seen prior to kicking on of drugs, because I remember that when I used some — I had the same feeling. So, basically, kombucha can be made. And it's not really disgusting. However, I'm a little bit anxious now. I'll update a little bit later. Btw, I've drunk a little cup, approximately 100-150 ml, so maybe it wouldn't be that strong. So, I shall admit, that nutmeg kombucha can be done and my experiment prooves it.\\update: so, basically, I experience some weak mood-lift. I should mentione that I used not so much, because it was quite experimental and I hadn't heard prior to this that someone had done something like this. Also, it tastes not bad. So, if you want — try this thing."
none,"So, no way of making it? I've bought 4 whole nutmegs and was thinking to make nutmeg kombucha. And after that statement I'm not sure what to do with them, because I wanted to do something else. Any ideas? Is it that problematic to make the thing I wanted?"
none,"You know, what I've found out recently? That with caffeine is hard to maintain semen retention mindset, because in the end, eventually, there would be unpleasant moments, when you feel no energy, lethargic and apathetic to any of your activities and here temptations arise. So, caffeine in the end only will lead to relapse, due to this fact. Declined effect of caffeine is one of the reasons, why those relapses happen. And, ironically, during relapse that accumulated anxiety is gone, because it is like some heavy drug, which removes anxiety from you. I don't know, really, whether this accumulated stress dumbs down, though it looks so. Also, toxic food plays the role here, especially refined sugars. I remember how I ate several chocolates and was crazily horny, like I couldn't take a look at any woman, because I was horny like a nymphomaniac/satyr. Also, fruits and vegetables helped me to get through the most of time and, sadly, I broke my schedule, not due to caffeine, but fasting. I fasted and started to wake up, once again, in the afternoon, close to the dinner time. Now, I'm gonna try to climb that ladder once again.tl;dr: caffeine in the end dumbs you down, that makes you apathetic and temptations rise. So, decaf is a way to that practice."
none,"You know, I may sound a bit heretical or something like that. However, I want to share some thought with you. As far as you know, caffeine can induce anxiety, so why not using this ""set-and-setting strategy""? I mean, today I've relapsed on caffeine, eat lots of tasty fruits and throughout the evening in peace, I've got lots of interesting thoughts and notes that are really in handy for me. So, my whole idea is that ""set-and-setting thing"" can be applied also to caffeine. Anyway, it's a psychoactive drug. May be not that strong like speed or meth with coke, however sometimes anxiety on caffeine is not pleasant at all. And today, while being caffeinated and in the pleasant place, even though I relapsed, I've spent time pretty good. I've listened throughout the evening some goa/psychedelic trance and it has given nice vibe to that state of mind. Don't know about you, but if I'm going to use caffeine once again, I'd use it in safe place, in tranquility with good music. Because caffeine is good to use, when there are less distractions, due to the essence of the drug. Something like that."
none,"I feel like I'm dumb and I can't concentrate. 3 days I slepts a lot, but that's it. Can't read, can't deeply think. My business isn't going anywhere. And I'm a bit disappointed. I don't like the feeling that I can't do my things, at all. I like to write and read and now I'm like dumb. I don't like the feeling of withdrawing that much and that long. I'm a bit... can't wait too much to restore. And this is a huge disappointment, because my sleep is quite deep now. Though, if I start caffeine once again — I'd experience racing thoughts and some fear of the dark. I don't know what to do, I'm trapped. I think someone was in this situation, so I ask for advice, if you'd like to."
none,"You know, I'm feeling pretty fine, like physical I'm quite active, though with concetration I experience lots of problems. I tried to read some book and you know, it felt like ""I was reading, though there are some problems of recollecting what I've read"". I don't know, like I don't really ""feel"" what I've read. Ironically, physical excercises I can do easily, though with reading or other things like that which need concentration... nah, not today."
none,"So, basically, I've just finished my experiment and summarized it for myself. I've eaten lots of cooked and prepared food — beginning from porridges, soups, etc, etc. So, I've found that when I ate lots of such food without any fiber, I tended to be sleepy, lazy lots of times. Ironically, though, at the same time when I used some caffeine — my bowel started to move and eventually I've found out myself in the toilet. I mean, lack of fibers is one of the main problem why life without caffeine doesn't work. Fiber is like a purifier of the colon, while eating cooked and prepared food in most cases is filled with ""destroyed fiber"", due to heating. I felt worst while I ate soups and food like this. So, check it out, more fruits and vegetables in your diet will make your decaffeinated life easier. You can just check it by yourself, make an experiment and you'll see the same results. In some sense, caffeine is like an artificial tool, ""artificial fiber"", because obviously caffeine does the same work, literally, as fiber, i.e. cleaning the colon, in some sense. Something like that."
none,"I mean, I knew that Far Cry games since Far Cry 3 was a weird blend of a shooter, mystic/drug related themes. And in the Far Cry 5 they made datura-based organised religion with Christian themes. I find it quite hilarious. Make America daturious again, ha-ha. Even waters in that game are saturated with datura. Even one scene there with baptism was with ""daturic waters"". Quite hilarious, especially mixing it with the south vibes. And datura-poisoned people there are called angels. Isn't it hilarious? Ubisoft amazes me with such odd and funny mix of various stuff."
none,"You know what's interesting? Knowing that most people ingest caffeine, people react towards each other with stress, which drains them both. I mean, both being stressed so strong with the feeling drained afterwards. That's why this society is fueled with spikes of anxiety and at the same time lack of energy. I mean, what the hell? People are screwed just by simple interaction. Don't you find it odd? No wonder we're living in the predator world, where almost everyone acts savagely towards one another. It's like begetting and pulverizing the fluids with negative energy. Or, at least, something like that. And it's a crazy thing. I've always felt drained after caffeinated interactions with others. I don't know, but the only thing that makes me better afterwards is a hot shower. Ironically, but on decaffeinated lifestyle people tend to act towards me like some sycophants (at least in some cases; if it is possible to  even say so) — not in the bad sense of the word, but something like ""they're more into me"" or something like that. I mean they're caffeinated, but act toward me decaffeinated like I'm superior (though, it may sound a bit megalomaniacal, however I've seen sometimes this thing). And it's a bit odd."
none,"You know, when I don't watch movies with such a context, I feel fine. But when I watched yesterday some movie with some plot, close to romantic one, I felt a bit... like my ability to love is still smeared with that narcissist. I mean, such movies are major trigger for my ""clear knowing"" of the fact, that she's not suitable for me. I mean, how to get rid of that ""knot"" towards her? The only way is not to watch such movies, I presume. I think the trigger should be weakened and later there would be no response to it. Am I right? I'm curious how others dealt with this thing."
none,"First, I've read some books on psychiatry on the matter and interestingly, but psychiatry per se started being developed in the beginning of the XIX century (the term was coined by Johann Christian Reil in 1808), right after the French Revolution. Another clue — coffee ""was planted"" in Europe after the war with the Ottoman Empire, i.e. the end of XVII century. And interestingly, though a century later — started various revolutions, psychiatry as a branch of science started to develop, etc, etc. I mean there happened lots of events. What if even during those times, they had already known about ""caffeine effects""? I just wanted to put things through the historical lens. Like: see what was prior and what happened later. What if psychiatry itself was just an offspring of that caffeinated problem? I suspect there is something in it, though you may not agree. Especially knowing the fact, that there was no coffee prior to that war against the Ottoman empire. In Europe there might be Indian teas, though I'm not entirely sure. However, with coffee it is a proven fact. And afterwards there were lots of praises about that drink, ""extra horniness"" that those even stated in some papers or something like that. I've even seen in some old encyclopedias that caffeine can be used as an antidepressant. Again, just historical information. This reminded me how Sigmund Freud praised cocaine and even wrote some articles about it, later being addicted. The same thing goes with coffee."
none,"So, basically, I've been experimenting with wormwood recently and found out, that it is a weak sedative, plus enhance dreams, however not that deep, comparing to valerian. I'd put wormwood something close to peppermint, close to it, because peppermint is a bit more relaxing, than wormwood. I smoked wormwood with using of a plastic bottle and foil. Also, I have to say, that wormwood a little harsh, I even spitted a bit with blood, though not crucial.Smoked valerian yesterday. Have to say, that smoke itself is harsh, even more, than wormwood smoke. And the effect of valerian was feelable. Not sure whether this is the right way of using it, however it works. The only minus of it is harsh smoke.At the same time, smoking wormwood is the best way of doing this. However, wormwood tea is not that bad, also. Smoke is stronger, though.So, the first thing in this ""comparing scale"" is wormwood, further goes peppermint and the most potent is valerian. Wormwood is not that deep, speaking about ""dream depth"", though dreams are more vivid. Peppermint is more sedating, though sleep depth is average. And with valerian it almost feels like ""being there, in dream"". It's like a metaphor ""being awake in dream"", i.e. it is more realistic with valerian. So, valerian is the best for dreams potentiation.Ah, forgot to add about sage. It's just a sedating herb, I haven't found that it potentiates dreams. Though, iti is relaxing, though not strong as peppermint.Hope, this short message has been interesting.P.s.: forgot to add, that there is no need to smoke a lot wormwood. Sometimes I felt that it was ""too much"", like smoked 2 times in 1 session. A bit weird, uncomfortable state of mind, like ""feeling weird"", not in bad way or harmful. Just feeling that is something not the right way to do. When I smoked too much I had to use some caffeine just to feel fine. Something like that."
none,"Recently got not that much money and been thinking whether what's the best — valerian root or extract? I've tried several times valerian extract with vitamin B6 and it was not that strong. While when I ingested valerian root — it was fine. Though, the valerian root dosage was 1++ g, closer to 2,5-5 g for great sleep. So, anyone compared those ""types"" of valerian? I mean, what's better? What's your opinion? Root for me seems to be stronger. Or at least I used nice valerian root and not that good extract. Also, I don't know how to compare valerian root and extract. Extract seems to be in mg, like from 20 mgs and even higher. With valerian root — it's like closer to 1 gramm. What's their ratio? Like if extract 100 mg — what's the same dosage, though with root?Also, can valerian be smoked?"
none,"First of all, I have to admit that after that narc I've started to feel some danger about women in general. Like, what if another cutie is gonna break my heart? Or something like that. When there is even some nice atmosphere, like people speaking — I have sweaty palms and want to run away. Like feeling danger. Like some spark that ignited inside and I wanted to run. Since that narc I've been suspcious about women in general. I've even started to avoid women at all, just not to allow that spark grows again. Also, I'm frightened to invite someone to my heart. So, don't know for now, though I know that it is the way to go now. Sometimes I even had the thing, that can be described as ""getting rid of that feeling"" or it may sound cruel, ""to kill love"". Ironically, but I started to listen to heavy music with that feeling in my head long ago. Later I just abandoned those thoughts and forgot about any love. Just lived. And that narc just made me get this thought outside of the depths of myself. I really don't know now, whether this is temporary or I was this way, ""unbeknownst to love"" or something like that. To this day I'm not even sure, whether am I capable of this. I know that sexual pleasure, but deep bond... I don't know. Basically, from the perspective that ""it is much to do"" in such situations. Or probably it's temporary contamination after that narc. I don't know, for now. I know now that I don't trust people, especially those who awoke something sweet inside of me. Sometimes I even freeze, when there are such situations. I'm speaking about this, because after that narc I've started to see this pattern. Even people said that I became more solitary, than I had been prior to it. Like ""less social"". I even had paranoia that narc might find me. It was like some kind of an existential threat. Now there is nothing about it. More like emptiness, detoxing from that narc."
none,"What if that falling in love with a narcissist looks like a crazy drug, though the real one doesn't feel like a drug, but more like a calm encounter, not crazy at all? Also, what if crazy state of mind is a marker of the toxic relationship? Like feeling in the body, that there is something wrong and intoxicating at the same time? You know, after that narc I don't really know, what love is. I know that ""narc love"" is like crazy love, called mania love. So, logically, the real one supposed to be the other way and pure. Not that love bombing, that narcs do or promises about ""eternal love"" and living together. I mean, with narcs it looks like a fake, total fake. So, my thesis is that real love is supposed to be the opposite of ""narc love"". If I'm not mistaken, there is a method, called ""*contradictio in contrarium"",* which prooves that if something is proven wrong, the opposite variant is supposed to be the right one. So, if narc love is proven fake, so the opposite of the narc love is supposed to be the real one. So, logically, if someone lovebombers you, it means that the right answer is slow-pacing love, like not that fast, etc, etc. If narc love is drug-like, it means that the right type of love is supposed to be ""non-drug one"". However, for now I don't know whether the real love is addictive or something like that. I'm just thinking aloud. Any additional thought would be welcome!"
none,"The only thing that I know that off caffeine my voice is deeper, probably due to testosterone going back to its normal range. I wonder, whether the voice chords are more tense on caffeine or not. I think, however, from some point, it may be so, probably due to temporary behavioral changes on caffeine, like more proning to hysteria and emotional outbursts. I mean during any rage there is pressure on the vocal chords, which sometimes turns into coughing after quarreling. However, it's just one thing. What about singing off and on caffeine? I'm just curious, from the hypothetical view. I know only that I carry more assuredness in my voice, when I'm off caffeine and less high tone voice. However, on caffeine voice tends to be not that deep, a bit higher. Or at least it feels this way."
none,"You know what's weird? Technically people are placed into the running circle of withdrawing, plus they don't feel any recreational value of caffeine. I mean, it's like with any other drug, like if that thing is used every day — its effects are barely feelable. I mean, this whole caffeination system is weird, it holds people drained and unpleasureable at all in the sense of any fun. I mean, every drug, if to be used, should be used short-term, not long-term. I know what it means when I drank caffeine every day and suddenly relapsed, there is difference. Let me explain. Every day usage leads to tolerance, that's why any caffeine effect isn't noticeable at all. However, when tolerance is lifted and when I relapsed — there was a real effect, I even wrote lots of notes and logically the whole picture became whole. Why am I writing this in this sub? Because obviously caffeine, if were used by people of the past, it was used for purpose of inspiration, like coffee clubs in France, prior to that revolution of the XVIII century. I don't remember vividly, but in the past it had other vibes, not today's, like junkies' ones. I mean caffeine in any form should be considered as a recreational drug, like other drugs. And it is pointless to drink it every day at all, because it's just like the same when people drink alcohol the following day to ease  their hangover. And the circle of the permament withdrawal... you know, it's weird. And constant stimulation or repetitive administration of a drug doesn't give any pleasure in the end. That's why the whole society is fueled with those ""anxieties and depressions"". I mean not all, but from repetitive drug usage, never ""chasing the dragon"" in various forms.I'm not pro-caffeine or anti-caffeine. I just say that people use drugs every day, even when the drugs have no already effect on them. Caffeine included and especially it is."
none,"Ha-ha, I'm already a poet. But seriously, anyone experienced something like this? Like it is not hard to pee, but the process has to be forced, like additional push for it. From some perspective, it may be the case, because on caffeine it is a known effect, frequent urination. Supposedly, off caffeine, it may be in reverse, like it was frequent and easy, and off caffeine it may be a bit harder and less frequent. So, basically, there is some logic in this."
none,"So, I started once again several days ago and since yesterday been experiencing some muscle pain and uneasiness. Anyone had something like this? Also had some insomnia yesterday. However, there is some positive thing — lots of dreams. Anyway, has anyone experienced muscle pain during withdrawing?"
none," You know, sometimes I find it is not that pleasant to touch things and  just take them on caffeine. Also, skin tends to be dry, even if I drink  lots of water. What kind of unpleasantness I've found also? When I read a  book, sometimes it is not pleasureable to touch the pages of a book,  especially if the quality of paper is like that from a newspaper.  However, off caffeine I feel it is not strong, that feeling. On caffeine  feels like I touch it and I experience some discomfort and minor  goosebumps due to touching it. Off caffeine it seems to be fine. Not  that strong reaction, really. Also, when I'm on caffeine and cut my  nails, afterwards I feel not that pleasant, off caffeine it seems not to  be that important. I don't know, probably, the skin is indeed better  off caffeine. Now I wonder, is there any parallel with other drugs, that  enhance tactile sensitivity? I mean, caffeine can make it vice-versa.  Just a sharing thought, that's it."
none,"Basically, I just want to share my experiment with others. So, I used some plum jam (with sugar in it) and did common kombucha, but instead white sugar I used plum jam. So, 3 weeks later I got somewhat bittersweet taste and when I took several sips — I got warm sensations in my throat and some kind of weak relaxation. So, it's just shown that it contains alcohol. Honestly, don't know whether someone finds this interesting, however I know now that kombucha can be used to get and make some alcohol drinks. First time I used cocoa and got alcohol beverage later, now with jam it works the same. However, I think cocoa alcohol kombucha was way stronger, probably due to lots of yeast there. Anyway, just wanted to share. Like to experiment. Cheers!"
none,"So, basically, I used common black tea starter kombucha and used sage and this experiment went good, taste also is fine. Another experiment — using wormwood instead of the common black tea. And this experiment also ended pretty well with that pleasant taste of wormwood. I just want to share that this herbs can be used. Also, they're fine and didn't turn into alcoholic beverage (2 weeks + brewed for now). Hope this would be interesting for some of kombucha enthusiasts. Also, used some herbal mix and it went quite well, also. The only herbs that I haven't tried are valerian and mint. If someone tried brewing this, reply here."
none,"Yeah, it may sound a bit ""nsfw"" or somewhat dirty, however I've marked that with excess ingestion of caffeine my underwear wears too fast, like it becomes more yellow and torn some time later. And it looks even worse, like quality of the underwear cloth. And interesting thing that my urine, its color, is yellow-er when I consume lots of caffeine beverages. I don't know whether is it only caffeine or something else, but I see the result of it. So, I have to ask those who quit caffeine: is the quality of your underwear is way better off caffeine, than on caffeine? Yeah, this question may sound too intimate and I understand this."
none,"I remember how watched video on youtube, where some woman brewed jun kombucha with green tea and I'm curious whether is it possible to do with coffee, yerba mate and other caffeinated beverages (and non-caffeinated). I only saw with green tea, so I wonder whether this trick works with other beverages also. I'm just curious."
none,"You know, I've been wandering whether is it possible to get high on other drugs, similar to DPH. Why am I asking this, because interestingly, but with other antihistamine drugs there were stated side effects like hallucinations. On some even there can be read something like ""intoxication, similar to anticholinergics"". As far as I know, this sub is quite experimental, so here is my question: anyone tried to experiment with other antihistamines/anticholinergics? Or DPH is the most potent drug of them all (from this class of drugs)? I'm asking this because it is interesting to see correlation between antihistamines and anticholinergics. Anyone digged it way deeper into this matter?"
none,"So, just remembered how I scrolled some pages of psychonautwiki and there was interesting quote from there, about ego inflation:[https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego\_inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)Quote from there:>**Ego inflation** is defined as an effect that magnifies and  enhances one's own ego and self-regard in a manner which results in  feeling an increased sense of confidence, superiority, and general  arrogance.[\[1\]](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation#cite_note-NourEvans2016-1)  During this state, it can often feel that one is considerably more  intelligent, important, and capable in comparison to those around them.  This occurs in a manner which is similar to the psychiatric condition  known as narcissistic personality disorder.[\[2\]](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation#cite_note-2) The last sentence seems quite interesting for me, especially the line ""similar to the psychiatric condition known as narcissistic personality disorder"". I think this part seems quite interesting. Don't you find it also interesting? Just food for thought. Especially, when caffeine and other psychostimulants are included in the list of aforementioned effect."
none,"Is there any need to potentiate glycine? Probably, there will be answers like glycine itself is quite good, however I wonder hypothetically, is there any need to use something else? I'm interested more about prolonging the sleep, because sometimes I wake up during the night. Any ideas/experiences?"
none,"They should have boofed it and they wouldn't have had problems with their veins. So, some women from the Boofah Witnesses were right. Boofing is the most safest route possible and veins are also saved. Sadly, the most profound words of wisdom can't be heard right away. Now I understand why geniuses were not accepted. Because boofing is a genius route of administration. Boofing wasn't accepted in the past, but now the glorious Renaissance is at hand."
none,"First of all, I compared cigarettes, rolled cigarette and cigarillas. Cigarette seems to hit harder, like weak stimulation with some relaxation afterwards. Rolled cigarette seems to have higher content of tobacco, which I found to be more sedating, than a cigarette. Tried some cigarillas. So, it's almost the same as a rolled cigarette, though it was almost impossible to inhale, so I held that smoke in my mouth and occasionally that smoke came out through my nose. So, I didn't like cigarillas, though it was cool and aesthetic in some sense. Also, cigarillas content is higher and it is closer to a cigaro's one. Cigarilla is like a microsized cigar, so I suppose they are similar. The only one thing I haven't is snus, so I won't speak it here. So, I found tobacco not that useful and sedation a bit weird.So, the herbs. I smoked **mint** and it was really good. Rolled a jount and after it I felt somewhat sedated, though even a bit euphoric. Comparing smoking mint and ingesting — with smoking it hits faster and there is a euphoric feel, while when I ingested it orally it felt more sedating and less euphoric. I'd say it's good and pleasurable. Also, it is better in the terms of sedation, comparing to tobacco. So, it is a good to use. I rexcommend this.**Chamomile**. I made not long ago post about it and it was really good. Also, recommend. Good sedation, more euphoric than mint.**Sage**. I smoked some sage not long ago and I also feel sedated. Today I used some caffeine and now I don't even feel caffeine. Feeling relaxed, lazy. Euphoria — not at all. Just pleasant feeling of relaxation. Not so strong in terms of sleepiness. Interesting thing, worth a try.Comparing those herbs, I'd say tobacco isn't that in handy, honestly. Plus, tobacco is hard on lungs. In terms of sedation I think tobacco is a bit weird, I'd say other herbs do this thing better, than it. Chamomile, mint and sage are good natural things and good replacement for the relaxation. Also, for easing comedowns it may be also in handy. Maybe there will be no need for benzos, who knows.So, I want also to smoke some wormwood a bit later, I'd update it here a bit later. Maybe, I'll find other herbs and update this post also. For now — what I've got is what I've got. Good start for now, I presume.**Edit:** forgot to add, that **bay leaves** are also smokeable, though it is better to smoke it via pipe. There is also light effect of smoknig it. I have no pipe, so I had some weak effect and only can test it when I got it. Because during combustion it burns really fast and I don't want to burn my beard. On youtube there are videos of smoking it, if you're interested."
none,"You know, I've been wandering here, on reddit, people make live broadcasting doing various things and I wonder whether is it possible that some anon makes something like this (boof kratom live). Why people can do various and stupid things live, but there is no boofing kratom there? Why some people can smoke weed live? It's almost the same as boofing kratom live. Why people can't boof kratom live? And kratom isn't illegal. I feel like there is some conspiracy about this. They want to hurt that poor little plant, that is medicine and natural."
none,"I've been roaming throughout the bank of the sea and found out the bottle with the message in it:>So, this is was just an ordinary evening, when I boofed kratom laced with some indica. Been wondering about secrets of life and the secret societies, because I believed there was something hidden in the world. And during that boofed rush I remembered how one man once told me the story, how he was in the library of Vatican. In some ancient book there it was said about weird dinosaurs, which existed prior to the birth of man. Their names were boofosaurus, kratomodactylus, fentoraptor, methosaurus Cokes, indicoraptor and many others. And he said that those creatures were really creepy and grotesque in their essence. For instance, kratomodactylus was just a dinosaur who could attack with leaves, thus intoxicating others with this opioid rush. Boofosaurus, for instance, could boof anyone, like its ass was its power. That's why some of us has a boof gene, some kind of heritage from those dinosaurs. Methosaurus Cokes could attack anyone with crystals, thus making another seeing shadows, phantoms. Daturodaucus is considered one of the most dangerous. And that man also said to me, that those plants and chems are just rememberings of the glory of the past.I don't know, honestly, whether this is the truth or that man just boofed too much kratom, causing kratom-induced psychosis. For me it sounds like a Lovecraftian horror."
none,"Recently been watching various trip reports about DPH and suddenly spawned an idea about horror game, based on DPH. Are there any?"
none,"So, withdrawing continues, pain is increasing. I'm even more deeper in that state of mind. Like some kind of transit. Weirdly, but I don't really know what for am I living now, honestly. Live to quit caffeine? I don't know. Everything seems to be bleak and I'm on verge of falling into tears, honestly, because I feel disgusting about my life. I don't know, caffeine for me a part of the problem, honestly. I'm also withdrawing from that narcissist. So, it's harsh. I remember how on caffeine I was sometimes a jerk. How to stay on the track and to see the light in the end of the tunnel? Btw, anyone tried to watch some movie about purposeless life? Ground hog's day I've watched already. Anyone knows something inspiring? Because I'm alone and honestly I don't know where to go, like I'm trapped. I wanna hide also from that lost sense of living. I even can't get to work, because it also seems pointless. Any advice? My family can't help me, because they simply say that I'm whining, that's it. However, I'm peaceful. Anyone can recommend some material/movie, etc? Maybe someone knows something pertaining to the topic? You know what's funny? I made here in this sub lots of posts and comments, but I struggle with quitting also. And it's harsh. Need some advice."
none,"How to regain once again the purpose of living? On caffeine it's like you automatically do various things, while off it it's like demotivation. From some perspective, it seems like less dopamine is flooded in the brain, that's why losing the purpose and sense of living. So, basically, some jogging should help? You know, when I started withdrawing, I've been seeing that I'm hooked up on the Internet, like without it there is nothing. And I feel like I'm a bit screwed. Probably, this is what people talked about when they spoke about ""inner problems"" or something like ""underlying causes of addiction"". If it is so, it means like my life was illusionary on caffeine. So, is withdrawing like some knid of disillusionment? Like losing of illusions? Like getting through the pain, like you're losing those illusions? Is withdrawing from illusions goes this way? You know, I'm even a bit anxious of going outside, like I don't know what to do outside. Partially, it sounds ridiculous, but it is so. Though, I'm calm, because I'm off caffeine. Is it this calmness, that people are lack of nowadays? Is it this calmness, that seems to be frightening? Because I feel somewhat frightened, due to that losing of ""running wheel of caffeination"". Any tips/ideas? How you went through this harsh time of decaffeination?"
none,I've heard it's a healthy drink and helps with microbiome. I wonder whether microbiome in my ass also changes for the better. Anyone tried this? I wanna stay healthy.
none,"You know, I suddenly found this thing. I just rolled a cigarette, though there was no tobacco there. I put mint instead and weirdly, but today I have no headaches at all. I suddenly relapsed yesterday on caffeine and today no caffeine. And no headache. Seems to be going nice. Today smoked that peppermint joint and yesterday, prior to sleep. I don't know, maybe some may find this interesting."
none,"Knowing the essence of caffeine, it seems like it works almost in the terms of short-term memory, due to reflex reactions, plus using the survival mechanism. Also, knowing that there are some problems with deep sleep and problems with GABA, I suppose all the whole caffeinated life seems to be in the short-term memory mode. From the other perspective, problems with sleep can lead to the problems with memory. At the same time, knowing how caffeine works, i.e. more into anxiety and something like that, everything will be described wrong, in terms of survival and safety. The other point is that prolonged stress is linked to the problems with memory. Like slowly degrading and degrading, weakening the mind and memory itself. And in the end, I think the final outcome is problems with memory and forgetfulness. So, I don't buy those studies, aka protective for the brain, etc, etc. Because chronic stress destroys memory. No wonder the memories fade away. I think dementia can be the consequence of this, due to the constant stress and caffeination. One point is short term memory with reflexes of survival, the second one — problems with memory and long-term memory, due to the fact of forgetting the things easier. You know, I sometimes find hard to recall what was a year or two ago. I think it's due to caffeination. However, I believe everything is restorable with proper care and attitude. I think I'd get some lecithin for the brain cells, probably it should do the trick, because brain itself is made of fat and lecithin. So, something like that. If you want to have perfect memory, I suppose caffeine is no-no. I think the cache itself is lowered also. I mean how much memory can be stored. I think off-caffeine, hypothetically, the capacity can be increased. However, I have to prove it on myself. Logically, there is something in it. Just if looking at this from the opposite side: if there is constant stress — there will be memory problems, if there is no constant stress — memory problems would fade away. Anyway, that's it for now."
none,"So, since the last two weeks I've started seeing some cavity and some problems with my teeth, like yellowing, etc, etc. And today, this reminded me another thing. If you've heard about ""meth teeth"", like how methamphetamine destroys teeth, it is possible to see some interesting parallel. Like all stimulants deplete the ""storages of calcium"" in the body. And one of those storages is teeth. It describes why people have problems with teeth on meth, plus possible cavity increase in today's world. Partially due to caffeine, partially due to sugary drinks. So, speaking about the first day. I have terrible headaches, even uncomfortable to see the light. Yesterday I went to sleep with heart palpitations and found them not that good, I think I overloaded my system with too much stress, that it is not pleasant. So, yeah, withdrawing. Hope this time I'll succeed. Took 2g of ascorbic acid. The only thing I don't like is problem with doing the things today. I'm not even sure that I can do some work or something due to this. Hope it shall pass, but when? I'd stick to eating more raw food, who knows, maybe it'll do the trick."
none,"You know, I sometimes experience some kind of detachment from reality. Like everything seems to be real, though partially I am dreaming. I mean, what if this dissociation from reality (or something like that) is just a coping mechanism with stress. You know, there is also a defense mechanism, called ""freeze"" and another one is like being dissociated. Like being here and ignoring being here or something like that. I mean, quitting caffeine may lead to full getting back to the reality, like harmonizing with or something like that, because defense mechanisms are weakened. So, any change prior to quitting caffeine and after quitting caffeine — have you marked any changes in the perception of reality? Does it seem to you more real, than it was on caffeine?"
none,"I  used to cook buckwheat without any salt or whatever. And I added some  chili and black pepper (ground) there. First time, when I cooked without  anything — it cooked fine, without any ""running water"", but when I cooked the second way — my stove was covered with lots of water, like after the great flood. I mean, what the hell? Is capsaicin or something  reacts with high temperature/boiling? I find it weird that water poured  out of the pan, when the buckwheat was with red & black pepper. Is there something?"
none,"I've been experimenting with various diets in the past. I tried eating lots of eggs, for instance, though it didn't give me the right results. Yeah, I felt good, even somewhat aggressive, though too much horny, that it was hard to handle. I tried to consume dairy products and it, though felt as comfortable food, I felt drowsy and lazy, plus also too horny. Gluten-filled foods are out of any discussion. I tried vegan lifestyle — it works, pretty smooth and easy I'd say, though even with cooked food I experience sleepiness and some laziness. I even tried to eat cooked foods throughout the day — be it either without vegetables & fruits and with them. Horniness on veganism are more controllable and tihs horniness is easy to be used for some purposes, like studying, doing other things, etc, etc. Though, on veganism with cooked foods I tend to use caffeine afterwards, due to laziness. And at the same time, after eating any vegetables, fruits or nuts/seeds — I feel energy (with nuts/seeds combined with vegetables it works fine). And I'm coming to intuitive conclusion, that I have to go further. I'm just curious whether there are some enthusiasts who've gone further in the terms of diet. As for me, recently I've found that veganism is not enough and i wanna go further, studying raw vegan lifestyle. Yeah, may sound hardcore, but I highly suspect there is something there. And I'm curious... anyone here, who're into it? Honestly, I have more thoughts on this matter, though I'm not entirely sure about sharing, because here people are different and not everyone accepts this lifestyle due to various reasons. However, I think here should be someone like this, because semen retention is probably one of the best subreddit here, on reddit. Even that man with profoundly deep thoughts is one the best here. Shoutout to /u/Reborninlife, you're awesome dude!"
none,"So, first of all, as far as you remember, caffeine turns the body into the fight-or-flight mode. Second, if taking a look at the defense mechanism of psyche, we can see, that in the fight-or-flight regime the defense mechanism is really strong, filled with that anxiety energy, so to speak. It's not only those defense mechanisms, that were shown in the psychology itself. It may be extrapolated even further. So, basically caffeine enhances the effects of those defense mechanism, though in a bit awkward, possibly even saying in a coward way. Like, if you're in danger — you'd probably run away (on caffeine it's a more common thing). And if this state of being is almost all the whole life in this defense, it is necessary to say, that without caffeine all those issues, from which the person was defended, started to come to surface. Either it pain or any other thing. For instance, going deeper inside is really hard on caffeine, if even possible. So, off caffeine it looks like those defenses are lowered and weakened, that's why the pain can emerge from the depths. So, caffeine in some sense a psychological tool of restraining oneself from solving his/her problems, due to those artificially created defense mechanisms. Don't know as for you, but for me it seems to be legit. Even from another perspective, the pharmacological one (and drug one) — when something goes up, it shall go down thereafter. And knowing that state of mind on caffeine, it becomes quite obvious to behold this thing. Anxiety, passive aggressiveness — everything is filled with defense, against even the things that have no need to be defended against. And after quitting of caffeine (most stories pay attention to the peace of mind) only shows the other side of non-caffeination. I mean, it's a cool insight."
none,"I don't know, but suddenly I found not so long ago, probably a month or two, that old movie of 90s, ""Fluke"". And I couldn't stand really, I cried so much. Probably due to lots of awesomeness in the movie, plus magnificent soundtrack. I remember the life prior to SR and I didn't remember that I could get into those emotional states of mind. Like it was blocked due to the harshness of lots of things. During those times I even started to feel that there is hope in everything in the world, that seems to be cruel and other ways. I don't know, probably I'm writing this in somewhat emotional state, because that film is touchy. I don't even remember, that films could touch like that. Without SR I couldn't take a look at this. And I find it really weird. Really life without such a lifestyle is like there is something missing here.Also, what's your favourite movies? What are your movies, that made you feel something like that? I've seen here some posts about that, like possibility of crying and feeling other emotions and its spectrum. I even find this as a some kind of a therapy, especially for some tortured souls — either due to some circustances in life, upbringing or even other traumatic events that led to forbidding other parts of the human psyche. Personally, I even think that some film therapy should be here, because it's like opening the other part of the human nature and that is essential with proper learning of how to understand this and use it in life."
none,"I mean, I remember those time, when that narcissist hooked me on the sexual stimuli, while at the same didn't allow to get closer? Like kept other person aroused, while narcissist liked the feeling of another of being unable to get another one wants? That narcissist, who screwed my mind was also abused prior to me (I'm not intended to help that narcissist, at all, not my problem). After this I'm left with a bit disorientation about all those intimate things, really. And when I spoke about all those things, she was infuriated and made me bad. After all those things even my friends of the past said she was crazy or either schizophrenic. And even advised against even speaking with her. At the same time I had several synchronistic events, that ""you'd better be away from her"". I mean, it's harsh when someone hooks up on the sexual stimuli and at the same time just screws your mind. I just want to know, that I'm not the only one in this matter. And everything was fueled by dishonesty and deception. Even speaking about this caused her fury. I don't know, it's like experiencing those things are besmirched, like creating bond of sexual stimuli with later punishment for having sexual arousal. And at the same time like narcissist creates artificially sexual trauma, equating having something sexual to further punishment for even having such a feeling. However, at the same time it shows the mechanism of how narcissists hook up their victims on this irrational thing. From the narcissistic point of view it shows how to save this narcissistic supply, leaving that person shocked and derealized after such experiences. Also, that narcissist used her victims as money supply, plus emotional supply, especially in the terms of living by using the money of others. Like a vampire, who infects her victims with that artificial poison. Anyone has other interesting observations?"
none,"First, during those times 2014-2015, I smashed into weird relationship, where that woman was quite abusive and narcisstic. Prior to this I was just a common guy, who studied  in the univercity. And after that encounter, failures, also due to that fap addiction, I started wondering, what the heck is going on. I even studied ethology, like why women act like this. That year ended without any new interesting thing. 2015, started like once again connecting with that woman. And weirdly, I saw synchronistic events, like an unknown guy asking me whether I was in the right company. So, during summer some dude sent me information about nofap, plus I experienced some intense anxiety and obsessiveness with lasciviousness and found it a bit weird to see everything sexual. So, two synchronicities were there.Next — I started nofap and suddenly I found myself on the semen retention path, because I practiced no PMO, plus no sex. Weirdly, but after it was hard to go further, hence started changing of lifestyle. I struggled to get rid of that narcissist, also. I mean, it's crazy like that narcissist was a catalyst to look at nofap/semen retention way. Also, I remember whom I was during those times. I even lied to myself. Now, I even have to re-value all those experiences, because I lied to myself and was unconcious about my flaws. On semen retention it's like impossible to do this again and like you hve to face all this crap, that you were unconscious off. Partially, people relapse due to this, because those problems are tough to solve. I'm nearly 30 days and have been experiencing anxiety recently.By this I mean that there is indeed difference. On semen retention is nowhere to hide, only to face. And it's unavoidable. Also, I think the semen retention path is filled with synchronicities, if watching attentively. And some things are catalyst to get out of the old lifestyles. Plus, semen retention gets back consciousness, making unconscious things conscious. So, Osho was right about excessive sexual activity, that it makes unconscious."
none,"Basically, yesterday I quit coffee, today been drinking tea, and tomorrow I plan to quit. Today I started experiencing more anxiety, even some OCD thoughts, even feeling depressed. I think the time has come to quit. Also, I have a hypothesis that teeth also suffer due to caffeine. My wisdom tooth fell out not long ago during caffeination. Now I've started seeing some cavity on my teeth. So, I don't want to lose any tooth anymore, so I'll quit tomorrow. However, I think I wouldn't stop there. I've been also experiencing vegan lifestyle since the summer of 2019 and it is not enough, so probably I'll try to go into the raw vegan direction. Technically, some nutrients may be destroyed due to the heat, and with raw food it may even more nutritious, than common food in the society. Anyway, you don't have to agree with me. Ah, also, when I woke up today my voice was deep, it means testosterone was high and I was peaceful. Everything is pointing me to quit caffeine at all. Technically, I'm living in debt of my body, so why living in debt, when I can live full life without any debt?So, quitting due to anxiety, temporary OCD thoughts, some phobia, plus bad sleep (and lack of dreams), obesity (belly fat & a bit enlarged breast; definitely hormonal screwing up). Basically, I've written everything, now gotta overcome this. The last barrier shall be broken. I'll whine a little, but I'll quit. No matter how withdrawal can be uncomfortable, but life on caffeine wasn't full for me, anyway, so nothing to lose. Gotta sail to another shore through the caffeine withdrawal, hope there is something else there."
none,"Weird, five days ago I experienced inability to fall asleep in the darkness, but now my sensitivity to light is increased. Caffeine intake is not big, yesterday even was more. Today I haven't drunk coffee, that's the only difference. Weird, like when I take a look at the light, my head starts to ache. Be it either a lamp or a chandelier — I experience too strong sensitivity. Anyone experienced this during semen retention streaks? I found this a bit uncomfortable. I remember I had something like this, when I was close to 3 weeks mark or something more. What can be a reason to it?"
none,"Here it was said about patents and how it was used:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine#History)I wonder, are there any lucky treasure hunterers, who got this thing? I mean... it's awesome to have something like this in the collection. Just a sudden thought has come to my mind, that's it."
none,"You know, throughout this whole caffeinated journey I've started seeing caffeine as a chaos element. I mean, by its nature it creates some chaos in lives. For instance, if your life was in order prior to it, with caffeine you'd start jump from one thing onto the other. I even think that on caffeine tbe brain becomes like a child's one — more into playful activities and less doing something really important. I mean, priority list whilst being caffeinated is screwed up. Even upon awakening one thing, and after the shot of caffeination you can go to youtube, for instance, and watch lots of videos there. I don't know, in some sense, every day caffeine usage is like chaos mentality, while off it is (supposed to be) getting to order. For instance, I don't like to clean the house, I'm lazy, speaking honestly. And even important tasks I sometimes ""overlook"" and don't pay attention to them. During jogging I even was wandering, what if this caffeine mentality is like a playful child, who just wants his/her own candies and fun, without any serious responsibilities? I know that nature of caffeine is quite chaotic (especially jumping from thing onto the other), so quitting caffeine supposed to change this point of view, like creating order of things. Yeah, I agree, partially it may sound like ""hey, you're lazy ass, you want to pretend that caffeine is the reason why you're lazy, but you're just looking for the excuse not to do anything"". However, to be serious, what's your stories about it? Has your life transformed from chaos into the order? Yeah, it may sound a bit philosophical and gnostical, though I'm curious about my theory and your reply(ies) may be some additional proof to it. And honestly, it is interesting to read how lives changed prior to caffeine and later in terms of overall life quality."
none,"And it was awesome. I smoked and felt some relaxation and 10 minutes later I was chill and relaxed. Haven't even thought that chamomile may relax that much. I thought it's just a weak herbal tea, etc, etc. But man, it's worth it to smoke some. I even giggled a little, so yeah, cool stuff to try. At least once you should try, ha-ha.P.s.: and music is awesome. I'm listening to debut album of Anthrax and it's fucking awesome! I'm happy."
none,"I remember when in the past I first clashed into that connection and weirdly, but I experienced cravings. I thought it was love, though it wasn't, but just some weird addiction. With those classical love-bombing from the beginning, later using this getting closer to her and getting further from her. I mean, I've seen all those stages. Even mockery with passive aggressive attitude with her saying me that I'm delusional, etc, etc. Deroagating my masculinity, my music taste, film taste, even she mocked my physical exercises. I mean, watching today's eyes it seems to be ridiculous. How can that be, that a person mocks and derogates everything, that another loves too much? And honestly, I didn't even look for any relatioship that time. And now, I'm not even sure I need a relationship. Is this the way most narc-survivors go through? I think it's like first getting over this ""bewailment"" that even delusional, because it isn't even a love. Like starting standing one's own ground, understanding there is no need for that person anymore (I won't go back, due to the toxicity), later shit-test by the universe like ""are you sure?"", and when that test is overcome — the journey continues. Still, I'm a bit struggle with my own masculinity, because that narc mocked me and said that I wasn't like her ex (who used her and got rid of her). Why am I asking this, because I'm a little bit afraid of women, honestly. And prior to narc I was fine, but after the encounter with that viper (narc-ess) I'm a bit afraid. So, has anyone overcome this? What else I might forget here? I think with stages of overcoming everything is fine,  though how to restore fully faith in myself? Because I'm in the brand new territory, though I'm a bit uncertain what's going on next. Any thought/stories/ideas?"
none,"So, don't yell at me, I know, I've been here for a year now and technically I should have quit already. Though, not yet, because I've been processing different traumatic things, narcissist withdrawal (toxic relationship), etc, etc. I've quit smoking tobacco recently and after quitting I started to think of quitting already, at last. With tobacco caffeine wasn't a problem, because tobacco gives some relaxation and it is in some sense an opioid. Why? I had a diarrhea for several days after quitting (for 36 hours with breaks). So, reason one why people don't take a look at caffeine.Number two. A lot of sex around. You may say like, blah-blah-blah, it's healthy, etc, etc. I say it from the pharmacological perspective. Technically, this pleasure is like relieving any stress, hence some arguing in pairs end up having sex. Some people partake in watching of pornography, hence the same relief. Though, prolactin rises up and it may manifest as mood swings. And knowing that approximately people have sex at least once per week, so now wonder they need caffeine just to get that stimulant effect. People who watch porn? The same thing. Like they got rid of their natural sexual drive and replaced it with the ""caffeinated stimulant"", hence cortisol/adrenaline spiking up.Third. Alcohol. Pretty simple, GABA. The same as benzos, barbiturates, Z-drugs, phenibut, etc, etc. Valerian, glycine are healthy alternatives. So, if caffeine disrupts GABA, hence people do something to being a GABA agonist, i.e. firstly going up, later with some GABA going down.Overeating — the same thing, though due to screwed up hormones a person goes to binge eat, that's it. Satiety hormones are screwed up, etc, etc. That's why there is a craving of comfort foods, like pizza, pasta, sweets, etc, etc. The same opioid thing, because food is like a drug, especially if we are speaking about gluten, casein (glutomorphins and casomorphins), etc, etc.The last factor: chronic stress. I remember how I searched for lots of studies, watched lots of videos. But I didn't use my logic in the past. Like, if A leads to B, and B leads to C, so A leads to C. Like some studies just show A leads to B or B leads to C, and if A doesn't lead to C straightforwardly, as it is shown in the paper, it hasn't been proven. At least it was in the past, when I looked over lots of papers, it was two-three years ago. Now the formula is simple: chronic caffeine consumption leads to chronic stress and chronic stress leads to deterioration of the body and mind. No wonder there is lots of mediocrity in today's world, because prefrontal cortex is screwed up, lots of stress overload. Is it even possible to see something else, when there is an overload of this ""stress bombardment""? A = chronic caffeineB = chronic stressC = consequences of chronic stressHence, A leads to B, and B leads to C, ergo A leads to C. So, I'll restore my sleep schedule and quit it altogether. I even have a suspicion, that after it I wouldn't need any other drug at all. It was cool to experiment, though now I suspect I've outgrown those experiments. Like it was a good lesson just to understand (and over-stand) neurochemistry, hormones and other things. And even saw those ""mental corridors"" and hardships of finding the truth. In the end, the main truth is inside. It's like believing what others say or what you say. Also, now I feel like I'm going the same vicious circle, once again, though now I'm almost ready to quit. Because the other side of the caffeine is problems with sleep, sleep deprivation and screwing up sleep regime. I'd say this is the main reason to quit, because sleep is essential and there is nothing that can replace those 8-9 hours of sleep at night. Nothing can replace it. I tried to wake up in the evening and felt not that good, even more sleepy, than usual. In the afternoon? Better, than waking up in the evening. In the morning? Yes, the best time. I'd even say to wake up early, like 3-4 a.m. The most refreshing sleep for me was 6-7 p.m. up to 3-4 a.m. The best sleep, plus the feeling that the day is quite long. And caffeine screws those feelings and things. And ingestion of caffeine is almost impossible without having some sedation drug afterwards, because sleep regime may be screwed up (and eventually it would be so).Also, if some wants to restore their sleep schedule it is possible to make something like that: you wake up, fast for 5 hours, later eat something heavy, hence you'll be sleepy, that may cause you falling asleep. You go to sleep, sleep for several hours, later you can ingest some caffeine just to get through the day and go to sleep in the evening. Several days (3-4) and you'll wake up the same time in the morning. The other way, it is possible through fasting, though for some fasting may be really hard, like for me (though I can fast for some hours after the awakening)."
none,"I'd say beforehand, that not all people are bad and something like that. Some people may be toxic or something like that. So, I hypothesize that, knowing some stories about toxic families, friends, relationships, etc, etc, may be partially a reason why some would use drugs, from alcohol, caffeine and nicotine up to hard drugs, game addiction, etc. For instance, being in toxic enviroment may be a consequence that leads to various addictions. I wonder, whether anons here have seen difference between being in toxic relationships and out of them, plus seeing caffeine in here. Logically, if caffeine was used only in this toxic atmosphere, when this place was left — that person might experience some relief, hence there is no need of caffeine.Also, I'd say some people may use caffeine due to living with parents or with someone else. A child wants to grow and leave parents eventually and it's the main goal (also, today the toxicity in families is a common term, that use psychologist to describe the phenomena, plus frustration of unsuccessful life also may lead to addictions). With someone else... it reminds when I dated some ""bad woman"" (ha-ha, I know what word came to your mind) I used to get to some addictions and when I left her — I started feeling relief, like I got rid of some unnecessary buggage and torture (narcissist included). By this post I wanted to pay attention when you ingest caffeine more — alone or in some toxic atmosphere. I mean toxic environment may lead to toxic behavior, like a virus. And when there is no toxic environment, this toxic behavior has no need at all. That's why people are recommended who quit drugs not to speak with other addicts, delete numbers, etc, etc. And honestly I think, when a person is left alone and there is no other toxic influence on that person — there is no need for addiction. Speaking about that ""bad woman"" afore, I wanted to say that with that woman I felt like she had more testosterone, than estrogen. Like she was more masculine, than feminine. Plus, she had trauma, that's why she started acting quite bitchy, hiding and fearing of showing her femininity (now don't know). I mean with her I couldn't be a man, only something different... not a man (also she tried to avenge men, because some man in the past made her bad). I mean, word/phrase chain: proneness to addiction - not being a man - more masculine woman - traumatic event - abandoning one's own sex features due to trauma. This word chain may shed a light on the problem, if watching on it from above. And those toxic behaviors, traumas, etc, etc, may take a part in all this misery and addictions. I think both suffer, because inability to be a man is a terrible thing and problems with femininity is another one. And on a biological level, a man may be lowering his testosterone just to maintain that ""homeostasis"" in that connection. Like a woman acts more masculine, hence a man should lower his testosterone levels, and it is possible to be done with caffeine, because ""anxious hormones"" rise. And if that man and woman are being parted, this ""homeostasis thing"" has no effect at all, because there is no need in it.So, my hypothesis is problems with quitting caffeine and other drugs may be due to toxic environment, traumatic experiences from people surrounding that person. And if separation with such people (like parents, toxic loved ones) gives a healthy result, it may mean that this place and connection just contributed indirectly to this drug addiction. I stress on this, because I've heard stories about men with not good women and when those men left those women — they've become better and abandoned their unhealthy habits. I mean toxic atmosphere may lead to addictions. So, separated from toxicity, a person may find himself in a new-found peace and freedom from the toxicity. Honestly, I'd give it a try, also, just to find out. Though, as for me, this idea with a hypothesis seems to be legit as for me. Just a piece of a puzzle. I think the more points of view on this matter — the more wholesome the picture of all of this. Anyway, thanks for reading. I'm a bit sleep-derpived, so don't be harsh on me. Cheers!"
none,"This:  [https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mirtazapine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mirtazapine)Is this true? Anyone tried this? I'm asking just out of curiosity. I don't know, personally, but for me it sounds a bit odd and anew. Any stories?"
none,"Firstly, I remember weird recollections of the past, when I hid in my bed under the curtain. Later, when I started watch porn and masturbate — this thing went away. Later, when I found out nofap, I started getting this crippy feelings, fear of the dark, etc, etc. And since those times I've been experiencing this. And it is happening on semen retention! What is this thing? Why is this happening? Because lots of things I did, and saw the only thing — on semen retention it starts once again and when I relapsed in the past — it went away. Any ideas? I can't go to sleep, due to this darkness. The only way is waiting for the sunset, though it is crazy. Any ideas?"
none,"Weird thing, I can understand becoming obese on caffeine, but why this thing is happening with tobacco? Weird, I even think my breast started becoming bigger, however I'm male. I mean, why is this happening? Too much cortisol? It seems like I'm semi-prolactinemic (or some word like that). Plus, sexual has become even lower. Does nicotine screw up hormones even stronger, than caffeine or am I mistaken? Any thoughts? It seems like high cortisol and/or with some prolactin increase (enlarging of breast area). Anyone experienced something like this?"
none,"I've been experiencing lately with pure tobacco, even tried mixing it with peppermint and liked it. Though, now I wonder, whether is it possible to smoke tobacco with some wormwood. I smoked wormwood alone a year ago, though I'm not sure about mixing of tobacco and wormwood. Anyone tried this?"
none,"I've been experimenting recently with tobacco, even smoked tobacco, mixed with peppermint and it felt good, pleasant, even synergistic. At the same I wonder about making other smoking mix, like tobacco with valerian. Anyone tried this? Ah, also, I have some wormwood (though, not sure about this). I once smoked it in the past via bong and it gave me some relaxation. Has anyone been experimenting with something like this?"
none,"It's weird, when I smoked cigarettes — I felt a bit stimulating and relaxed. But when I bought some real tobacco, I started experiencing sleepy sensation. And now I even started to think that tobacco can be used as a sedative drug, due to that relaxed sensation. I'm not a specialist in tobacco, though it seems like it can be used as a dream potention thing. I don't know, it's a bit weird for me, especially knowing that I smoked more cigarettes, than real tobacco. Is it the way it's supposed to be? Tobacco anons, your experiences? I just find out it's hard to work throughout the day, for instance, if tobacco makes me sleepy. Or maybe I did a lot tobacco, that it feels this way? On psychonautwiki it is stated, that high doses of it causes sedation. And I even think that those shitty cigarettes caused more addiction to me, that this pure tobacco. I'm writing this in the state of being caught by suprise, because I haven't thought that tobacco can be used as a sedative thing. I even think it can be used in the evening, because during the day sedation is not that good for the productive day. Any experiences/stories about tobacco?"
none,"So, firsthand, I wanted to use it for quitting caffeine, though it didn't work out. I was a bit stimulated, though sleepy. Though, my cigarettes cravings were gone, so it may be in handy for some. I don't know, I just used it to see how my attention and productivity would differ. So, I relapsed on caffeine and gave it a try to phenylpiracetam. 200 mg per day is not that strong, though feelable effect — I read a book quite good and it was fine, even imagining what those parts of the book were about. 300mg — effect almost the same, though I started being a bit jerky, aggressive A dose more, 400 mg is like the same effects, as 200-300 mg, though I started to experience later some nervousness, feeling really stimulated (though not like amphetamine). With doses (per day) higher than 300 mg, I've found out that my body later, after several hours (3-4 hours or something like that), like during comedowns I felt overheated and that effect I didn't like, though it was bearable, not that insane. So, 400-600 mg, I'd say, it's more of a stimulation, though in ""racetams sense"". Like you're stimulated, though brainy, attention-wise. However, I'd say that apart from attention this drugs is not enough, though it does its job well. I think to phenylpiracetam it is necessary to add something, like ""imagination component"", because attention is present, though imaginary thing may suffer a little bit. Also, doses 300mg+ even more feelable, than caffeine itself. Personally, it was interesting experience (especially with high doses): with 600mg I spent all night (due to insomnia) reading books, playing Q.U.B.E. 1 & 2 (I even dived into the atmosphere of those games, during phenylpiracetam effect), watched videos and started creating plans of action. So, stimulation-wise it may be used, though it is not forced, like with amphetamines.I'd say that perception a bit different on 300mg+ doses, though it is not amphetamine-wise. More attention, feeling of understanding the concept. Though, I think understanding of the depths of knowledge (like imagination) may suffer a little bit. Don't know, maybe something's missing, though for now my experience is this. Maybe, if taking a look a little bit later — I'd find out some other interesting points, who knows. Also, comedowns with 300mg (and higher) doses a bit uncomfortable, especially that overheating sensation. I think about adding some choline next time, if I'm gonna use it. Also, some thing for sleep later, like valerian can be in handy. Because I used some and it went quite smooth and pleasant, though sleepiness wasn't that strong. Also, I wonder about potentiation of phenylpiracetam with common piracetam. Another hypothesis — it can be used to potentiate other drugs. Though, I haven't studied this field, though it seems to be interesting. Like in some guide about MDMA, for instance, I saw that some users used to potentiate it with piracetam. Maybe, it is possible to do with phenylpiracetam, who knows. Though, as for me this field isn't researched well-known, so I wouldn't give assuredness about this, though it seems to be interesting, at least hypothetically. Something like that, hope you've found this interesting. Cheers."
none,"Like adding some to rice, vegetable salad or something like that? Or adding some to my smoothie? And how it is really needed to have something on endocannabinoid system? Just curious, if someone tried this and whether there is some even effect. Some anon answered me about microdosing, though I'm curious whether it may be needed even lesser dose for the activation of it."
none,"So, I've been thinking of quitting tobacco altogether and started wandering, whether changing a common cigarette on pure tobacco and smoking with a pipe. Technically, it should be better. Why am I asking this, because I feel like there is some effect from tobacco itself. Probably, it may sound like words from an addict, though I think if smoking tobacco with a pipe, thus getting rid of toxic substances in a cigarette, it may be a healthy alternative. I don't know, partially I like this feeling after a cigarette and like the effect, though I detest bad taste of cigarettes. Anyone tried using a pipe with a pipe tobacco instead? Any change? Also, using pipe tobacco, I think is not necessary to use everyday or, at least, that much as common cigarettes. I don't know, when I smoke many cigarettes during the day — this nootropic effect is not that strong, though if several cigarettes per day — I feel better. I'm just hypothesizing now, though curious about using a pipe. Any thoughts?"
none,"You know, I remember when I tried (even not for prolonged time) being off caffeine and remember, how my music prefences were a bit different, than on caffeine. For instance, on caffeine I can listen to lots of different heavy music, like death metal (Morbid Angel, Obituary and other bands), grindcore (Napalm Death and others) and other metal genres, where there are lots of heavy stuff. And off caffeine I tend to listen to more ""easy-listening genres"", even remember how I liked more classical music (Mozart, Bach, etc, etc). I don't know, maybe it's only me or other people as well, but I've seen this interesting thing. So, I suppose music preferences can be changed with using of caffeine. Though, it sounds hypothetical, I've seen this thing. Anyone else? Has anyone experienced something like this? Have you seen something like this?**Edit: screwed the word ""preferences"" in the title :(.**"
none,"So, first of all, I remember in the past I've seen lots of articles about how to increase semen amount and there was something about lecithins. And, I definitely saw, how sperm count was increased. Also, it is known, that semen can be re-absorbed. Clue #1.Second, lecithins can be found in the brain tissue, which also play an important role. Lecithins       belong to a larger group of compounds called phospholipids. These are important parts of the brain, blood, nerves, and other tissues. Phospholipids are also a part of cell membranes. The body uses lecithin to move fats and in the metabolic process. Lecithins turn into choline in the body. They help make the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  Quote from here: [https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=19&contentid=Lecithin](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=19&contentid=Lecithin). Clue #2.Thirdly, if semen is preserved, it can be re-absorbed. And if it is re-absorbed, all this lecithin goes to the different parts of the body, especially to the brain. Knowing also, that lecithin is the part of the brain tissue, it is possible to say that there is something about weak-mindedness in the today's society and deficiency of lecithin. And, at the same time we see how it is over-promoted excessive sexual activity and lots of sexual clues and pornography. Plus, here it is necessary to remind the fact, that not everyone follows good diet. And if that person partakes excessively in sexual activity, plus poor diet, he may become weak-minded, because lecithin, which is important for the brain — is used for the creation of the semen. It can be found also with cholesterol. I think this was in the pic somewhere here or in another subreddit.It's just my hypothesis. Though, I think there is something in it. Personally, I find fat-rich foods, like sunflower seeds are quite useful, because they have enough lecithin for the brain. And I feel good later after it. Something like that."
none,"Hello, can you see me? I'm right here! If you hear, please respond. Urgent call, respond immediately!"
none,"I don't know, I can't quit for now. Without caffeine I can't do anything, this tiredness is too strong. I even yelled at my family, screaming lots of various unpleasant words with hateful context. I don't know, temporary I can't quit. However, I'd give it a try later, when my situation would be fine. Because I don't like the idea of yelling and screaming on those, who live with me. Probably, I'm a bit frustrated due to problems with job and withdrawing from the narcissist. However, I'm encouraging others to go take their caffeine, no. If you can live without it — do it. I think it is the same approach as quitting different addictive foods, like sweets or cheese & bread. If you start to quit everything at time — you'd probably fail. I'd give it a try, when it is gonna be ""easier time"". Eventually, I think, I'll quit it naturally. I think, I haven't worked through my survival instinct in this world, like standing on the ground with strength. After that coronavirus, I know that lots of people lost their jobs. Something like that."
none,"Hi. I've been struggling with this narcissist woman for almost 6 years. First time I wondered, why was I craving her. Like craving. Felt like I was hooked up on some heavy drug. I started to speak with her, though I wasn't sure why that was happening. And later, problem date... like she seduced me, though at the same time fooled me several times. She even mocked my masculinity, though she kept me aroused, like a filthy animal. At the same time, she spoiled me with those sexual things. I started to see the world through the hornified glass. And it's terrible. Like everything turns to be sexual, even obsessed with it. And after her, I started degrading. Became a bit worse, up to the moment when I deleted my social media, accounts, changed my phone number.Though, it wasn't enough. When I quit her, I felt good for a while, but later started to feel despondent, empty. And every time I got back, once per year. I always wanted to show her, that I'm worth loving for. But she didn't get it. Never got it. Even when I spoke with her, she had no interest at all. Like she manipulatively fooled me and my feelings. Sometimes I abhor her to the most. Also, I wished I punched her in the past. Now, I'm not even sure, because I don't think such people end well. The only one thing I wonder... how to quit her entirely? All my life was dedicated to proving I'm worth it. But any my proof was useless. And I'm troubled with finding the purpose of living. And also I wish to have defense against her, because it is weird how a narcissist can become a sense of living. Pretty weird. I know that I have to go for prolonged no-contact, because I relapsed every year. Now I'm three months free from her. The only problem I've become alone. I forgot how to make an acquaintances. I don't even know how to love people, honestly. And I'm feeling a bit cold. Sad. Sometimes it is even hard to get out of the bed. I know this connection is toxic and I'm going this way now, no matter how harsh it is gonna be. How long will it take to get free from this? I know that my life started to become worse after her. Relationship ideals? I started to see women as whores, capable of cheating and even with thoughts they use men for money and exploit their feelings. Yeah, I know, I supposed to be strong, though this weapon, i.e. narcissist, is like a mental toxin, the drug that stronger than heroin and cocaine combined. Personally, I think, I've come already through several stages: 1) Being inebriated in love fool without any understanding what the heck is going on  2) Starting looking for the answers and seeing the narcissist as a drug, that disrupts other areas of life  3) Getting answers, taking a look once again, getting the same results  4) With understanding of that person hasn't changed — full narcissist withdrawal, aka going cold turkey, no matter how painful it is.During the 4 phase I see myself — sometimes quite misanthropic, sometimes deplorably sad. I see how this negativity is getting outside of me. I don't know, really, how to find a new route in life and new relationships, because it is really hard, after this trauma. I do my best to resist the urges of numbing myself with anything (I used in the past pornography to numb myself), having heroin addiction, because I lost my way. And it's hard to get back on track. How long will it take to being alive once again? Sometimes I have a feeling that life is going on, though I don't partake in this life at all. I'm a bit afraid of her. Like she made me bad and that feeling was put onto other women. Like I feel some threat from women. I don't have friend even for now. I forgot how to have a friend, at all. And those things happened after that narcissist. Even I started asking my masculinity, she mocked my masculine traits. Even mocked my interests, even sports. I abhor that viper. You know, when I read the Bible, there, in Proverbs, there was something about that woman, whose ways are bound to hell. It reminded me that narcissist, honestly. Something like that.Also, forgot to add, that everything was begun with lovebombing, later abused me and mocked my sexuality. She used me as a crypillow (right expression?), though never let me get closer to her. I tried, she did bad things. She used me as a fun thing, for a while, while at the same time she was messaging with lots of other people. And she used other supply, there were others like me. And she took money from them just like a kept woman does. I'm not sure she's even capable of love. She's more about using others to get money, have fun, etc, etc. Nothing deep. No self-reflection she had on that moment, though it was almost 5 years. Also, she herself stated that she didn't like self-reflection. I think this is the whole picture.How long will it take to find myself again? I know what I like, though sometimes I'm incredibly saddened and despondent. I think I have to overcome this a year mark, just to get to the new level. I know there is something else right there. How to ease my pain? Music? How to find power to make things done?"
none,"I don't know. I've marked it as a false twin with lots of understandings, spots, etc, etc. Though, ironically, this thing, lions and names are still continue spawning on. What the hell? If this thing is toxic and doesn't work, why those synchronicities still appear? Also, I'm feeling now like I've lost my path. Despondency, inability to go further, problem with living, etc, etc. I don't know, in some sense I've lost all hope to live, because I don't know what to live for. In the past I used to use drugs, though now drugs are not interesting for me, partially because I'm lazy to spend additional money for drugs. What's the point? Is it process of quitting or am I just mistaken? How can this be, knowing that person is toxic? Also, her name sometimes even spawn. I mean, universe, stop mocking me. It ain't fair. Why this thing is going on, if it doesn't even work? Why even marking it as a false twin isn't enough? Or it's just a prolonged withdrawal? I'm in a cul-de-sac and don't know what to do. Colors became bleak, it is even hard to get out of the bed. And I'm not even interested in watching movies, playing games, etc, etc. Just emptiness. Dark abysm of unknowing. Anyone knows what to do? Because I don't know, really. Lost all meaning. I even thought how it was sweat and awesome, when I used drugs. Free of anything, pain, etc, etc. Sometimes I even don't know how to live in this world, being sober. I'm several days caffeine and nicotine free and I'm sad and despondent. Don't want to move either. And I don't know, whether it is due to that false twin withdrawal or is there something else? How can this be, if it was toxic? MAdness."
none,"Technically, it is possible to make kratom kombucha, kratucha, let it be named. Anyone tried this? You know, I'm interested in making this thing, when everything will be fine. Because it seems interesting. Like fresh, cold, brewed kombucha with using of kratom. It sounds really awesome, especially knowing that this ""kombucha movement"". Also, cannabucha in the US is sold already (saw it on youtube). It is a new field for research (drug-research, ha-ha), I suppose."
none,"Firstly, I remember how I relapsed several times a day and later, several days later I found that I became obese, even minor gynecromastia. As you know, pmo is a drug — dopamine (chaseing) and opioid one (relaxation for a while) and sense of being empty afterwards (prolactin increase). I assume any excessive sexual acitivity in different forms increase prolactin, which is connected with low testosterone. So, any opioid drug decreases testosterone, at the same time antipsychotic drugs decrease testosterone and increase prolactin (I stress on this). High prolactin = moodiness, anxiety, etc, etc. Also, I suppose that low testosterone has something with bad digestion. Like during those relapses I was obese in the past, though later, a week or something like that — with some additional physical activity I started to lose weight. Though, at the same time that famous study about increase of testosterone a seven days after the beginning of the experiment show that prolactin levels are leveled, because high testosterone = low prolactin. Hence, modern obsession with sexual acitivity may be a reason of obesity, due to increased level of prolactin.At the same time, the modern world is obsessed with stimulants, caffeine and other ADHD drugs. Like those drugs just counteract that lack of sexual energy, drained by lots of sexual activity. Like changing the natural sex drive on the artificial, stimulant based drive. Also, here it is necessary to say that there are drugs which anorexigenic, though act like stimulants. The same thing.  Prolactin fatness and using of stimulants, which increase dopamine (high dopamine lowers prolactin levels). Necessary to remind, that some antipsychotic drugs (dopamine antagonists) increase appetite and prolactin (hyperprolactinemia). So, here, I suppose, I've showed another reason why people become obese. At the same time, showed that people use artificial stimulants, that remind them of their sexual drives, that are lost in excessive sexual activity, because sex itself and PMO the pleasures, that act almost the same, dopamine-endorphins-high prolactin / low testosterone cycle. Also, it is possible to say that bulimia and overeating is like getting rid of stress, which may be the consequences of too much prolactin. High prolactin, because, is a moody state of mind, even anxious. Necessary to remind that high prolactin can be seen in pregnant women. High prolactin men are also moody, have problems with memory, etc, etc. So, semen retention is a way to go, from the other perspective. I think, I haven't said something new, though I think it should have been said. Cheers."
none,"First, throughout the whole trip I felt like it was really something between weed and MDMA. The dehydration thing, red eyes and feeling overall like I smoked some weed. Second, effect on the body seems like the same of MDMA, i.e. body load, some a bit uncomfortable load on liver and a bit on kidneys. On MDMA I felt similar thing.  Comedown of nutmeg is like feeling of being tired and a bit anxious (for me it was), probably I used it a bit late during the day, that's why felt this way. Today it feels like I'm a bit with those post-effects, which also remind me MDMA and weed tiredness. I assume, this high may be useful, though I assume there should be used something for liver protection, like milk thistle or something like that. Also, interesting to know what metabolites are after the ingestion of nutmeg. Are they neurotoxic, like those of MDMA? It may be metabolized the close way, like molly, though I'm not sure. Also, today feel a bit sluggish, lazy. Something like that."
none,"First, I remember when I fell in this love trap, when it hit the bottom and was shocked on how it was strong. Obsessed. Later — parted ways. And by reaching her again — I was hooked for a while, even felt euphoric and mind-altering with some obsession. Two times. First, when I wasn't even aware about how love can be so obsessively painful and hurt in weird ways. I was a bit shocked after that event and started looking for the answers. And through this work, I've released most of the unnecessary karmic baggage. Even understanding of various lessons. And when I turned to veganism — like I've started dive deeper and on veganism I started seeing things clearly. Later, during the second ""reaching her"" (on vegan diet) I saw how weirdly this connection was. Like on the common diet — I was intensely obsessed about her, even was blind to her concealed actions. The second encounter was not that inebriating, like perception changed. And even it seemed during the second ""exposure of me to her"" I felt really that it is weird, that there is nothing behind of all of this. Nothing deep. And, as I've said in the title — interesting thing. I think there are stages of total detox of false twins. Like first, aka ""weird awakening"", state of anxiousness and a bit messed in the head. Second, after learning lots of things, lessons, finding some truth — the second detox is like the second exposure with seeing whether all things are learned. For instance, my second exposure to her was like I saw perfectly that there is something wrong in this, like this bubble of delusion, and I think the less such exposures trigger — the better. It's like a proof that lesson learned. Also, the third stage is like shit-test, to be assured by the universe that you don't bullshit her. I think lots of things go this way. And I suspect the fate will test me, when I'm fully be freed of this. It was several months that I went no contact and see like I'm getting back to reality and to things that I should do. And, also, sometimes life may seem bleak, knowing that was hooked up on this connection. Like it was a purpose, raison d'etre. So, it's a bit hard to start a new life, especially knowing that my past was the main idea to prove her that I'm worth it, to be loved. Though, the same attitude with ""not-interested thing"". And the same toxicity, though there is a feeling, that I've become different, when it was first. Really. Though, from her point — the same modus operandi. So, ultimate test — is like prior to this was given a sense of living, later it was taken away. And after this, there should be finding of the meaning of life, personal meaning of life. That's why it's like re-starting life: from having something — when taking it away, crisis should be solved. Total restart of life. Something like that."
none,"Firstly, cool tune is playing now:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5TqIdff\_DQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5TqIdff_DQ)Second. It is good. I feel good, though comeup was nearly 4-5 hours. I used 15 g, before it I drank tea, smoked cigarettes. 2 doses of phenylpiracetam, 100 mg x 2. Comeup was a bit between sobriety and something weedy. Now it also feels like something between weed and MDMA (a bit exaggeration, though on nutmeg I'm feeling now some empathy), more the first, than the second.Third. Why am I saying about cannabinoid receptors? Because, two things that happen during weed or nutmeg intoxication. Red eyes. Plus, bodily it feels like I smoked some weed. Two interesting observations. I don't know, see it through the detective's lenses.High is worth it, at least in low doses it's cool. Pleasant high. I'd say good start, even. 10-15 g is a good start. I don't know, I even like now to read something, listen to something spiritual even. Cool. And I think it's a decent mind altering stuff. I think low dosages are enough, because I used in the past 25 g, though once. And it was too strong. I think nutmeg can be used also like a ""relaxing stuff"" in those dosages. Nothing serious, just high, really with sedative essence."
none,"Hello, my nutmeg friends. I've been wondering about the ways of trying nutmeg and found interesting one. I've been experimenting with kombucha since the beginning of this year and found possibly interesting way of consuming nutmeg. Like it is possible to add nutmeg to the kombucha brew and drink it later. Possibly, it may be done also for the second ferment (though, I haven't done it, so it's just an idea). I've brewed kombucha with using of hibiscus tea, so it tastes good, plus really pleasant to drink. So, I added some nutmeg there and have an idea to use it today (15 g). However, I think about potentiating it a little bit today with some oolong tea, later adding some phenylpiracetam and afterwards — ""nutmeg kombucha"". For the safety reasons I'll use 15 g, because it's just a common dose. I used in the 25 g and it was too strong, especially in the terms of dehydrating. Something like that. If everything is gonna be alright, I'll make a trip-report. Also, I'm with speaking a little bit and listening to some advice about this. However, I think everything should be fine, because interactions seem to be fine and not harmful. The only thing I've found (for now) is reference to nutmeg's MAOI activity. Phenylpiracetam is not MAOI and caffeine is a weak MAOI, so technically it should be safe."
none,"Probably this question a bit not that ""research chemical-istic"", though this community is quite cool and friendly. And out of curiousity, I wonder, are there any adenosine drug agonists? Just a thought that came into my mind, maybe someone knows something like that? I know, question maybe not that ""recreational"", though hypothetically it is interesting to know, whether there are some drugs like this."
none,"The strange thing I've marked. Maybe, it's just my observation, though I'd share. I'd use chakral system. From the pharmacological perspective, caffeine acts on the first chakra predominantly, aka figh-or-flight response. At the same time, the most active parts in the body while caffeinated are kidneys, genitourinary system, hence overactivity of genitals. Symbolically and metaphorically, it means that the main active parts of the body are below kidneys. Chakrally, it looks like the energy circulates primary in the lowest parts of the body (not higher, than the third chakra). At the same time, during my streaks, I've found out that prolonged retention is like energy going upwards, from the lowest chakra. Heart chakra is a bit different, from the lowest ones. Heart chakra is like manifestation of different traits and it's closer to oxytocin, manifestation of empathy. While fight or flight it is not empathy, it is more about the reptilian brain features, aka survival. Survival is more about egoism, not altruism. I think while caffeine energy circulates not further, than the third chakra. Because the further I go throughout semen retention streaks — I see the same picture, like my energy is stagnant and I start to feel anxiety and some fear, uncomfortable-ness. When caffeine-free I'm more empathic, energy more stable and not that ""cranky"". Even more peace towards the world and people. At the same time it is necessary to mention, that caffeine is a matrix drug. Why this substance is all over the world? Doesn't it feel suspicious? Like overactive genitourinary on caffeine, increased horniness with some anxiety. It's like survival mechanism, though caused artificially. And during semen retention it is hard to go further (at least for me). Like an artifiical blockage, caused by caffeine. At the same time, the whole attention on caffeine is projected outwards, like seeking for the threat, constantly. I assume caffeine is just an inhibitor of going further on the semen retention journey. I don't know, though symbolically it looks this way. At the same time, other parts of the body work a little worse, because the whole accent on the urinary tract. You know, personally, when I drank more water on caffeine and urinated — horniness was decreased. So, there is something in it. Why am I also speaking about caffeine, because those who created this matrix, wouldn't have spent resources for the things they need. And they don't want others to reach the whole possible potential. That's why lots of obstacles on those ways. Hope this was an interesting food for thought."
none,"Has anyone tried to do this? I've been struggling with caffeine addiction, though it is hard to go through the day, though caffeine gives additional anxiety that disrupts me from doing my work. And honestly, I've had a though of using of phenylpiracetam to get over it. Any ideas? Has anyone done this? Or there may be another route to go? Like acetylcysteine?"
none,"I wonder whether is it possible to practice microdosing with nutmeg. I've heard various reports about microdosing of acid and mushrooms. Also, heard about microdosing of amanitas. Though, in the same manner it is possible to say that microdosing of nutmeg is also possible and can be done. Anyone tried this? I'm just curious. Also, I think this question should be asked, because some may find it interesting. What do you think? Your experiences?"
none,"Just was listening to this band, was curious about that album and found that song. I don't know, maybe some would find it useful. Just a thought has come into my mind to post this. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D64fzY-Vz-I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D64fzY-Vz-I)"
none,"Like you know, when someone cooks a proper meal, spending time on the kitchen or something. I remember how I used to eat canned food. Also, it is possible explanation why people can be hooked on the fast food (means no need to be prepared, hence ""fast food""). Maybe this is not something new, just sharing observation."
none,"Yeah, you may say that ""you're buddy too late, it's 21st century"", though I'm curious about this. I know there were (and are) pills and ethanol solutions (like phenobarbital). So, orally it is the way to go. Or is it the same as with benzos, which only possible to use orally? I'm just curious. Why am I asking, because I have phenobarbital dissolved and ethanol and with removing of ethanol via heating it is possible to get phenobarbital crystals. Or at least it is possible to check this thing. What's your opinion? And is it safe at all to do this (insufflation)?"
none,"May sound a bit odd, though I'd post it. You know, during all of those semen retention streaks I had a feeling that everything I was learning throughout those journey seemed to be ingrained in myself and my biological material. I've always seen that all semen retention streaks differ from one another. Like on some I studied one thing, one another — something else. And I wonder, what if everything learned during those continence periods is suppose to be passed to new generations? Like sharing DNA — both in the form of semen and information, contained inside of it? Yeah, I know, sounds a bit crazy. However, I think this is not nofap, and as I've seen here people discuss really outside-of-the-box things. For me, this sounds an interesting topic, especially knowing how differed all those semen retention periods of time. I remember how I did some thing and it felt the other way, than the other streak. What do you think about this?"
none,"Before ingesting I drank several teapots of green & black teas (throughout the day; 3-4, 2 or 3 teabags per 500 ml teapot). So, technically my body was a bit stimulated. And now, 45 minutes after ingestion, I feel really pretty feel-able sedation (even want to sleep already). Ironically, I remembered how menthol in peppermint acts on kappa opioid receptor(s) (which is also responsible for sedation). However, I feel a bit sad. Sedated and sad. By this post I wanted to say, that natural things can be in handy, too, especially if there is some problem with getting other stuff."
none,"Hope no one would abhor me for saying so. I don't know, after this breakup I feel a bit... detached and even freed from some perspective. However, at the same time I started to see more darkness in this world. Like, I feel this world in some sense can be just a prison. Why? For instance, the body functions are like a prison for a soul. Country? With laws and its weird punishments. And all those things seem to be like a concentration camp for some thing done in the past life. You know, I even found some system that stated what was in my past life. One of the things, that happened in the past I had made somenone to make abortion (woman). From the other perspective — I had committed treason to the country I lived. In this lifetime I have problems with relationships, sometimes I even feel detesting towards having a relationship. For instance, with a false twin I experienced the feeling, like I was a dog on the leash. And I constantly wanted to destroy it, obliterate it from the face of the Earth. I sometimes even feel entrapment towards all of those things. From the other perspective, in my country I'm almost no one. No friendships, no people, etc, etc. From that system, that woman said that my whole life may be a strong action towards going outward of the country, to live somewhere else, due to the things done in the past. Recently I haven't been here always, because I don't know what the purpose for it for now. I sometimes see those posts about waiting, etc, etc. Smells like some suffering. I think I started to be a bit cold to this concept, like it was when I was aroused. Now I don't know, honestly. Partially, because lots of movies show this thing ""happily thereafter"" or something like that. And in life those things not always happen. Sometimes, during those post-torn ties period I feel more misanthropic, sometimes even have thoughts about darkness. Sometimes I even feel disdain towards modern degenerate world, filled with vices. I may sound a bit Shopenhauer-esque, though really a modern man is worse, than an animal. Especially in this programmed society. Think that, do that, dress like this, act like this, etc, etc. And this system based upon surveillance, laws, etc, etc. And almost every movie is filled with lust. And that thing was started after that ""sexual revolution"" of 60s. Why am I saying all those things? I don't know. Honestly, I'm disappointed about lots of things, especially getting in the relationships I didn't pay for (false twin). Honestly, I've been always looking for an aid to escape those bonds, even tried drugs. Yeah, it may be obsessive and it is definitely so. I've always seen a body as a prison, though a biological one. And now, honestly I think that I don't really want to find any twin flame or something like that. I wasted too much time on a false twin. The only question comes to my mind, what for I wasted all those years? Some biological insanity with a feeling of disdain afterwards. Now I even started to think, that those ""fallings in love"" supposed to be for the creation of a family and procreation. Maybe I'd sound a bit harsh, though I'd even say that intersexual interactions are in handy for this approach. Because it is biologically supposed to be this way. Otherwise... I think it's a waste of time. And all those relationships and breakups were just a waste of time. Probably, after everything I had I don't want to let someone to come into my heart. Because I know how it goes, the same ""marry-go-round"", fun, procreate, repeat. And yeah, for me it feels like an entrapment, going in circles. Even a family for me seems to be the same way, like a prison. After that false twin exposure I started really think and feel like I'm a lone wolf. Not a company person, at all. Find sometimes those things boring. Even have no interest in pursuing relationships at all... like the same talks about ""what are you doing, work, interests etc, etc"". The only thing that sometimes bothers me, that ""sexual urge"", that's it. Sometimes I feel that this is a bit of a distraction on my way. In some case the same entrapment by the body. I even thought in the past that asexuals can lead an easy life, without those animalistic impulses. Just post-breakup frustration and dissappointment in all of those things. Who knows, maybe I'll dedicate myself entirely to hermit-ism (sounds almost like hermiticism), because I feel when there is no a human around — it is entirely peaceful. And also I saw hermits. In some cases it feels like there is something mystique in all of this. Even saw painiting of some.Probably, some would say or sugar-coat all of the said above, though no need to sugar-coat. All of the same games are being played. All the same comes in circles. Nothing new under the moon."
none,"Hi, newcomer here, didn't know there was a subreddit under this name. You know, today, I've been sluggish and incredibly lazy. And I went to run outside, in the forest. You know, what's the weirdest part was about all of it? Prior to running my mind sent me signals that ""I'm lazy"", however during running I had lots of energy. Outbursts of energy. And later I understood that it is just rewiring, like doing other things, instead of was in the past. Semen retention is a way of lots of shit-tests, so to speak. And through those shit-tests will are being born. Technically, this semen retention journey is like constant procreation of important qualities — be it either will, strength, holding one's ground, etc, etc. And during those moments mind tend to fool one. And this is trial. After running I still under the impression of how can this be — tiredness and lots of energy to run outside. It looks quite foolish. Probably, brain likes to conserve energy, that's why there is constant resistance in doing something new, creating new habits, etc, etc."
none,"I know that some people refer to that myth of Androgyne from the Ancient Greek mythology. However, this concept of twin flames seems to be from 10s of this century. Am I wrong? Yeah, weird, I've never asked this question, I just dived into this concept with the feeling of amazement. At the same I wanted to describe that ""high state"" (pun intented) and that twin flame concept came in handy. You know, sometimes those problems with twin flames also resemble me that state of frustration, when a person can be excited and can't get further, ergo this ""enhanced cord"". Like monkey mind says ""I can't withstand rejection or inability to get what I want"", etc, etc. Anyway, who invented this concept? Your thoughts? I know only that Ancient Greek myth, that's it."
none,"And here rises up the question. With my false twin I experienced weird things. I once saw a book at her home, with so magic approach, even there were spells in Latin. I mean. If she bought such a book, she might have done something like this to me. Because, what's other purpose would be of a woman, who'd buy such a book? A year later or two, I found out that some women cast love spells just for their love interests to be subdued. In some cases, though, I read, it can be used in good sense, though in some (and most) done just out of egoistical wish. Yeah, sounds a little bit crazy, though in my family I had a weird thing. Like my mother visited in the past some fortune-teller and she said to her, that her husband (my father) was under this love spell. And my father was possessed during those time, according to my mother. Also, he was ""not there"" and detached from her and me. At the same time, she (fortune-teller) said that your son would have problems due to this ""spell"" (and I have some kind of a troubled life). I mean, throughout life I've heard weird occurences. I mean, there is something in all of this ""love spelling"". At the same time this false twin thing in my life seemed and felt like ""I was cast upon some love spell"", because I more abhorred her, than loved. I even had more anxiety. Anixety, abhorrence and lust. And all the way my spirit resisted it, because I've always felt that she'd lead me to perdition. La femme fatale, so to speak. And you know, I even had a book about this ""love-spelling"" , even there were statements on which chakras it is done. Even there were reviews, who did it, in some cases it was fine, in some didn't. I mean, this false twin flame thing may be something like this. Like a master controlling his subdued person. Like a puppeteer. And it looks like this (at least in my experience). Anyone studied this thing? I mean, it may be crazy, though even folklore stories have something about this. Even symbolically. Also, I just had an impression of dishonesty after reading such materials. Like mind-control freaks or something, which I don't like. And if supposing that every thing is not a coincidence, it may something in it. Just sharing. Probably, due to the fact that here is people are open-minded to crazy ideas . Any reply would be appreciated."
none,"You know, throughout my life I've screwed lots of possibilities and relationships. And that false twin only made me to understand this. However, all of the work done I haven't found why I have some problems with relationships in this lifetime. I only have a hypothesis about ""past-life traumas"" or something, because this life I've looked everything that was already. No other clues. And the same thing repeats itself. No I wonder, how to know, what happened in the past life, that lead me to this lifestyle? And I know that relationships matter a bit tricky. Honestly, I've started even fearing females after that false twin collide. I'm really afraid even to fall in love and run away from the places, where I can experience some uneasiness and awkwardness. You know, I may sound crazy, but in the past I even had no doubt if any attraction would be gone and I can do some mission. Now don't know really, I'm disappointed by myself and feeling worthlessness after that false twin. I even feel hatred when see or hear this ""soft things"". In this moments I even think that I'm not even a human, but something else, entrapped in this body. And after that false twin I sometimes even had a thouight of ""better not to wake up, at all"". Like harsh things to be known, harsh awakening. Anyone tried to solve the mysteries of karma/past lives karma? I know that there is something in me, and probably not from this life. I've studied it all through and only the same pattern of ""failing relationships"". I just need some hint, because sometimes I don't know what to live for. And I don't want to binge drink booze, at all. I think that false twin I've understood that I'm somewhat gynophobic. Like it was unconscious, now it is more conscious. What's the cure? I'm fearing of losing myself, if I get someone in my life. Sometimes I even fear of treason and cheating. And during those moments I even want to protect me from this humiliation. Am I screwed up in my mind? What to do?"
none,"First, I'd say something about my family prior my lifestyle and after. I was a common Joe, who studied in the university, doing my things, started even earn some money. And later I wanted to search myself, what I really should do in my life. And bam, new things started come in my life. I was on verge of something new, started nofap lifestyle, for instance. Later started changing my diet and here the first observation. My family always wanted to put meat in my mouth, though I thought that there was something wrong in ""the diet sense"". What observation is here how it correlates with NEET lifestyle? Simple. THere is a thing, called ""status quo"", when people follow the same routes throughout their lives. For instance, I changed my food ""priorities"", changed diet. And my family didn't like it. By my example their status quo was under question, like ""how? why he does something we don't do?"". And this observation reminded me the herd mentality, crab bucket, etc, etc. You'd say, how it resembles to NEET lifestyle? Simple. If you change something else, that is not thriving and showed as an example in the society's standards — you'd find some resistance, even from the family ones. My father still has a strong pride about his meat eating and mocks in concealed sense my lifestyle. Isn't it ridiculous? This is a crab bucket thing. Just check it.This: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUQ2WGA8mJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUQ2WGA8mJQ)Another example of herd mentality is this:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IJCXXTMrv8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IJCXXTMrv8)That's why a NEET lifestyle can be hard, due to the influence of herd. Even the family can make you stuck. Like they don't want to change status quo and afraid of change and afraid of seeing other people change. That's why mockery, bullying and other things. That's why NEET lifestyle is a challenge of utmost will. No wonder, lots of people here struggle with this, up to desponency, anxiety, etc. Because this pressure on NEETs, even from the family. It's like doing a bad job for others. And fear is the root of it. Remember also the film, ""Interstate 60"", where the father of the main hero wanted him to become a lawyer? And what was the consequences of this action? No spoilers, sorry, but the end was horrible. And his father disliked his idea of going the other way. And with restoring of status quo others feel fine, though not the person who started going his way. And his hard, because of this pressure. Sometimes it may feel like ""they want good for you"", though they just fear of something else, that differs from the ""rooted worldview"". It's like a battle. In some sense, children of parents want their support, though sometimes this support only makes them miserable. Friends? They may also don't like some things. The same status quo. I once even spoke with some and about interesting insights, though they said ""you're too in the clouds"", or like I've invented some pipe dreams. Some even think not by themselves, though just jerk off on scientific papers, which was in my old friends, that not friends anymore. I mean critical thinking and seeing through things and lies. The way of authenticity, as Carl Jung would have said. And this tension and wish of those to get one back to herd is the root of mental distress. Something like that."
none,"You know, I tried to work in the past and didn't like it. Like selling my life for some money, which they can print how much they want. I think people are aware of that thing, called the Federal Reserve system. They print the amount of money they want. And the whole world is depending on the dollar. I mean... the whole system a bit weird. Total dishonesty and enslavement of the whole world to this ""Federal Reserve"". Even the USA is the slave to this Federal Reserve. The first point.Another point to all of this, that people like slaves (and are slaves). Sometimes I even thought that this whole Earth is a prison for people. In some countries it's not that bad (good decorations) and others a bit harsh. Like Chine with their intense surveillance system. Or poor countries, like in Africa, where people are suffering — both from diseases and malnutrition. Decorations are different, thought the essence the same. I know, I may look sad and depressed, though there is some cruelty in this world.From another point — the marker of success is how much money you can earn, via slavery and being a puppet (otherwise I'll fire you, you lazy ass; don't like the job? gtfo). I know, I may sound like some kind of a loser, but I'm not entirely. I had studied lots of things, though this is not enough. And some knowledge aren't profitable at all. And how to be in this world? How to earn money, doing what you like? I've tried and I've failed. And due to all those things I turned somewhat sociophobic. I used to be fully playing the game in this world, earning money, etc. Even wanted to date. However, this didn't lead me to happiness at all. Something's wrong in this world. And since the school I've been experiencing this feeling. From the other perspective, there are people who said some metaphysical things, like ""blah-blah-blah, do this and money will go to you"". I tried this crap and haven't gotten any money. Opium for the masses? New age nonsense? I even tried to help people. Even here, on various subreddits made posts. Yeah, like getting rid of tension, sharing knowledge. However, this is not enough. And the main point is that it comes to selling oneself as a prostitute, like ""I have knowledge, you  can fuck me for my knowledge"". Hi, boss, I've come to your job just you can fuck me and my time, giving me money for this. Total en-whore-ment. Like there is a word ""enslavement"", let the word ""enwhorement"", also be. Yeah, I'm a bit pissed off. Even wanted to get some drugs to ease this tension, however, this doesn't change anything. I'd be back to the same crap again. And at the same time, hard to find people with the same spirit. I even live in my country and there are no those, who are on my side. I speak here, on reddit and occasionally I have a feeling that foreigners understand me better. I don't know, how people work and get money and have no tiredness. I tried to work and felt only tiredness. I know, that when a person works, he has money, however all his energy is removed for those ""work things"". Like an energy extraction machine from the masses to do stupid jobs. In the light of this, I think I understand why Buddha said that the world is full of suffering and different illusions. Any pleasure is temporary, and the pursuing of pleasures would never be enough. Pharmacological tolerance. Remember, how you bought a book? First impressions are ""awesome, wow, cool"", later turning down, decreasing in its efficiency. And later ""ok, fine, I have a book"". No such rejoicement.  You know, those things remind me the people, monks, etc. Like they are in some sense are outcasts. I think, some despondency also is/was there. NEETs, hikikomories and someone like them have the same qualities. Outcasts, despondency, those abysms of unhappiness, anxieties, struggles with life. I don't know, in this society it seems like doing stupid shit is payable and something related to sex, also. I even in the past searched for various information and the information that really was in handy, was hidden or had not that much views. For example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTDoUkHzEds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTDoUkHzEds). Interesting information about dreamherbs with a good lecturer, however it is not famous. I think the main problem of finding the way through this NEETdom is because there is less attention to the work done. And it's hard to follow the passion and doing what one likes. I may also sound megalomaniac, however it is hard find people who are closer to my spirit. I was with some people, however saw them as a dogmatic herd, with others — they defend only their opinions. Like closed-mindedness. I have even an acquaintace, who just jerk off on the Freud's psychoanalysis and isn't into other things. I mean by this, NEETdom in some sense can give opportunity to become open-minded, even too much. And some can't accept this open-mindedness. Even a person who works all his life feels butthurt when he hears something about ""no working"". In some sense working can shatter the ground of a NEET-person, which can turn him/her into a mediocrity. You see? Lots of issues here. And yeah, some would say ""you're just a lazy ass"" or ""you're not sad, you're just a lazy ass"". I think, philosophical systems, religious views wouldn't have been born, if there would be ""everything good in this world"". Hikikomoris and NEETs just show in some sense that society is sick. It's still fueled with the feelings that we live on the planet of the apes. Primitive and repugnant in its essence. Even animals in the wildlife live more peaceful and closer to nature, than the modern man. Holy shit, I sometimes feel like I'm an alien in the body of a human. And yeah, like a detention on this Earth. I'm a bit pissed off and sad of all of this."
none,"Imagine, if all drugs would be legal. Imagine if there would be some kits for those, who'd like to use drugs. Like, for instance, a psychedelic kit may consists of an acid tab, short manual, plus some aid for the moments of bad trips. Or, for instance, an opioid with instructions, how much, what to do and narcan for some purpose, also. Or a kit with a stimulant with some additive like weed or a benzo, for instance? I think it would be like some kind of a progressive way of mind-altering with a proper education. Sounds cool for me. I don't know, just suddenly a though came into my mind. Or, for instance, a kit for those who wants to quit drugs with proper instructions, dosages, etc, etc. Or imagine, like you go to the place, where you can buy those things legally, like real opium instead of new various substance. Ah, probably I was fantasizing a little bit."
none," [Awake,  awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD  the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of  trembling, *and* wrung *them* out.](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-51-17/)  Isaiah 51:17.Cup of trembling. Cup of his fury. Wrung them out. Doesn't it remind you something? I once googled information about coffee in the Bible and caffeine in general. And this quote really looks like a cup of coffee."
none,"You know, if seeing all my whole story, I can say that I've been living in the family, where there are some disturbances in sexual roles or something. Like cold mother, distant father, etc, etc. Even lack of emotions or something like that. Cold. From the karmical point, forebears did something wrong in the past, which, I assume, can be visible in their children. Even Niztsche said, that a son is an opened book of his father. Logically, it can be applied to daughters, also. Believe me or not, but my grandmother, for instance, in the past had a crush and abandoned her child. After this relationship, she was feared about her feminine side. Even found a husband, who more feminine, than masculine. My mother, for instance, also fears her feminine side, acting like a detached, cold woman. Even her men told her that she is a mystery. However, for me she looks like a cold, who is afraid or doesn't know what to talk about. Too much shyness or something. And also she had a breakup with my father, however the facts are conceiled why this had happened. Ironically, my grandmother abandoned her child and my father abandoned me and my brother. For me it looks like karma. Also, my grandmother's child finished pretty bad with dark histories. Another lesson, why is it harsh to leave a child. I think he was sad about this fact. Also, humiliation of the feminine essence from other people. And detachment, closing of this ""feminine doors of vulnerability"".From my father's point of view. He acted more like a child, than a proper father. Like more fun, than seriousness about all this thing. The most important things for him were ""to eat meat"" and ""to consume some woman"" (getting laid, to be straight to the point). And when he left, he didn't care at all. I was in his village, where he grew, saw his relative. Both mother and he are cold, afraid to show any feelings. More stupid laughter or something. And, ironically, most of them had/have some problems with heart. Heart chakra problems, I presume.Getting back to me, I had problems with relationships. Even didn't know what they are for. Like, for getting laid? I assumed it long ago. I've always thought that there is something wrong in all of this. Like why people showed me only the animal part of all of this? And yeah, from this point I seemed to be an outcast in the school. And abhor school for this petty shit, like knowledge I got there was a waste of time. The only thing I learned in school — pornography, alcohol and cigarettes. Nothing else. Ironically, my mother even prior to my birth wanted a girl. Like she wanted to continue this line of ""unsuccessful and empty, lack of love relationships"". At the same time my name has some meaning of ""solving family matters"" (from some perspective, speaking about esoterics). I mean, what the heck? Why I should solve this generational shit? Also, Carl Jung, had some opinion about ""family memory"", ""dna of ancestors"" or something. And the same false twin came into my life and I started to understand, that there is something wrong in this ""family matter"".I assume those twin flames came to those, who have strong problems in some cases. Like re-balancing the scales. And believe me or not, I can see some things about all of this. Like why that happened, etc, etc. Sometimes I even want to cry because of all this shit. This pressure. Even after this false twin flame I feel abhorrence towards any relationship. I know, however, I am created by God and his creations cannot be flawed. However, sometimes it pisses me off, this animalistic drive. Sometimes, I even had a thought, that if I got a proper mission in life and did it without any ""relationship matter"", I'd be pretty happy. In some case, this relationship matter is fulled with lots of drama. Just this false twin thing even if to consider. It is a crazy thing. Sometimes I even feel fury towards those things. Sometimes I even don't want to hear anything of this sissy shit and turn something heavy and aggressive and to smash something. Yeah, I may sound a bit misanthropic now. Though, if you knew all the whole picture, wouldn't you be angry? I sometimes even question myself, why I play in all of this crap? Even I wonder, whether this tragedy happens to everyone or is it just for me? Honestly, I don't even know what is it to be loved. And I'm not even sure, that I want to have someone close in this matter. Because I always in the past got people away. I think I'm also philophobic. And had a false twin. See? There is some definite correlation between personal problems, family matters, karma and those connections. And no wonder, such things happen and cause some distortion, mental discomfort. Probably, some would say, ""blah-blah-blah, do you work"", etc. Yeah, easy to say. I've never even liked my parents. Even they helped me in some things, though I still have some disdain towards them. Honestly, I don't even know what those ""love things"" are. I feel love only for my cat. Don't know, always liked more animals, than people. By the way, if someone wants to talk, I'm fine with it. Who knows, maybe with your reply I'd be onto something new. Anyway, those connections are just for cleaning all the crap inside, even maybe in global scales. I saw this karma effect in two generations. So, the proverb ""reap what you sow"" works. Even in long distances. Genetic distances. No wonder all those twin flames things are fueled with pain, misery and feeling high. I don't know, what other thing can be a cause of dhanges, apart from psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca and other psychedelics."
none,I tried several times and the drink itself started to have some alcohol taste. Should it be this way? Is this the way of all second ferment drinks? Or maybe I do something wrong?
none,I've read recently that it can be used for some sleep purposes. Some sources stated that it can be used for enhancing of dreams. Anyone tried this? How much should I use? I have grounded leaves.
none,"I'd say a bit controversial thing, however I have some observation. I've thought about it yesterday, prior to sleep. Weird thing, like I had people with the zodiac leo — first I had two friends during school-university, who were a leo sign. Later, I had a crush on a woman with a leo sign. And the second crush, who supposed to be a false twin flame — also leo. Also, I had a strange synchronicities about ""leo"", even my pillow has an image of lions. Recently I've seen a car with my name on it and a roaring lion sign. Yesterday I even had a crazy idea, after seeing here a person with ""leo/lion"" nickname in it (it was here, in this subreddit, just common visitting reddit). Even had some thought, like has anyone found their matches here? I don't know, those lions were always in my life and I don't know how to say it otherwise. I think even most people whom I met in my life were lions, lol. And at the same time I tried to look at this from different angles — beginning from symbolism, ending with some metaphors aka animal nature or something like that. I don't know, just wanted to share a thought."
none,"During running a though came into my mind, like two days, when I wrote to her, I experienced sadness and even some despondency, even smoked some cigarettes. And weirdly, though, I feel like there is some energy mismatch, that's why it didn't work. I feel more uplifting, than ever, even cleansed a lot of things in me. In the past this connection attracted, though this attaction has been decreasing since my first awakening. And now, it is almost faded. I mean, this is the thing people spoke about (especially twin flame sites/youtube). Like preparing for someone new, maybe she waits for me somewhere, who knows? However, with her (counted as false one) I felt only draining of energy, up to sadness. And after quitting — my mood rose up. Plus, radical energy mismatch, I suppose. And I feel this growth in me. Sometimes I feel even like I'm shining, can dance during running in the streets. I've never before done something like that and felt this way. Like soul sings . And that energy mismatch doesn't bother me at all. Like everything is going the right way. I feel this is the premonition of something new. Hope you also doing and feeling well ."
none,"You know, everytime I spoke with her that connection was fueled more by lust and obsessiveness, which always distracted from my goals. And, ironically, when I quit this connection — I started to prosper. Like my ideas were (and are) flowing properly and easily, when I'm without her. I mean, stagnation is the key of determining which one is true and which one is false. My case: the connection was shallow, not deep, more ""lust-oriented"". Nothing spiritual at all, more materialistic. And only when I let her go I started searching for the answers. However, she always wanted to get me back to the same feelings, ""lust sphere"". And I knew that there was something wrong. Once had synchronicity, when an unknown man to me said to me whether was I in the right company. Back to all this diving. **I think, if something or someone tried to distract you from you own way, deluding or leading you to cul-de-sac or degradation — that's the wrong twin flame**. False, I mean. However, wrong also sounds good . Also, for me lack of sinergy — is another sign. False hope, I presume, also here. She always was tricky, answering on only the matters she liked and never giving answers. Something shady always. I think now this way and think this is right. It's logical. In my case — she hasn't changed at all in her modus operandi (it started 5 years ago). And I have no hatred or something. How can I have something bad towards her, if she unpurposefully helped me to get here? Nah. Also, ironically, every connection is failed, like it doesn't go further at all. Who knows, maybe universe preserve me from the same cycles? Something like that."
none,"I reconnected, spoke a little bit. Though, with past things revisited and spoken about, now I feel free, though I don't know why I have to connect with her. Like I feel a bit lonely, though I'm not sure that she can match me now. Plus, I have some trials to go on further. Also, I don't like the idea to be connected in the social web. Like it was cool in the past, though after quitting social webs I started to feel free. But now it's like of an addiction matter. Like I want to get response, though not sure when I'm going to get it. Also, after speaking her speak feels cold and detached. I wonder, what if after all those troubles revaluated — everything with her has come to the end right now? Let go? I have a feeling to do so, because she would not satisfy my loneliness for now, at all. Plus, I have to finish my work. I don't like being in the social web and wait for the answer, at all. That coldness, also, doesn't fit for me now. However, I think people would tell let go. I mean, if it supposed to be, it would happen somehow. And I think this detachment is a marker to let go, because time's not now. And my cleansing hasn't finished yet. Also, after speaking with her I started experiencing some unpleasant thing in the area of my heart, some palpitations and a headache. However, I've heard from narcissistic experts, that some narcissist victims experience something like this, including autoimmune disease (dr. Ramani reference)."

It looked for me as purification on the biological level. I assume it happens on different levels, though I'm not entirely sure for now. I wonder, has anyone experienced sudden disease or detox during those connections? I think there is something in it, however more anecdotals required."

Sounds quite eerie, though I think, when someone collides with such topics, lots of things starting to be seen in different ways.

none,"You know, I read in the past about those things, especially seen after reading that amphetamines and cocaine affect this protein, which is responsible for addictions. Also, I heard first time about this when I saw a lecture about ""The Great porn experiment"", where it was stated that pornography addiction has something about this DeltaFosB expression. Psychostimulants, pornography addictions. However, here is something missing. And recently I've come to an idea, that caffeine can also affect DeltaFosB protein. If all stimulants are connected to this thing, why caffeine can't? Partially, it describes the same pattern about addictions. I'll leave link here:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSB#Delta\_FosB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSB#Delta_FosB)Hope, this was an interesting food for thought.

Especially knowing lots of reports, varying from anecdotal ones up to the scientific ones. And this thing can be a good one, which can be posted into the FAQ of this subreddit. Something like that."
none,"First, preface. Prior to this acquaintance I was just a common boy, who was in the last years of the university without any knowing what to do onwards with my life. And suddenly, after some weird occasional high with my friend I spoke with some girl in chats and it was really weird, because I had never interest in her prior to all of this. Also, I didn't even look for any relationship. I was in various high, speaking about nothing, just for the sake of high. Later, by some occasion happened something weird. Something has started. Plus, she took my number and saw it as some kind of something ridiculous. I had no interest in all those relationships. I used to date with someone in the past, though really I wasn't interested. Just did it as others do, like programmed by the TV things, media-shown love or something like that. Also, I had an addiction with pornography, thinking that ""nah, relationships... easier to jack off — no one cares, no responsibilities, etc"". And I got high with her, though she wasn't. And in the past I wasn't experienced at all with those relationships at all. And suddenly, after high all those things happened. I didn't know her at all, though she was ready for those ""intimacy things"". And I screwed with all of this and she was extremely mad at me, strongly. Partially, I hurt her, though at the same time I felt extremely weird about those ""first-or-second-night sex things"". Prior to that ""high party"" I felt something... bad. Like I was craving for her or something. And after that ""high"" I felt extremely weird. I was mad. I was intoxicated, like a pawn with obsessed thinking about her. Partially, it was also drugs, like speed, etc. Those talks with her were weird, because I had never felt prior to this such an intense falling in love. It was so strong, that I couldn't sleep properly at night. However, it looked like some game. I felt intoxicated and couldn't get closer, because she pushed me everytime away. And I abandoned that connection, saying ""I can live without you"". And I did.The next year, I experienced depression, struggles with drugs, pornography, etc, etc. The second time it was failure. And up to the end of this short connection, I abandoned it once again. And here started another synchronicity, when my friend sent me information about detrimental effects of masturbation and pornography. I started quitting those things. And here started my spiritual awakenening.I quit meat, became vegetarian, started looking about various matter. I knew that there was (and is) something wrong about this world, about this ""matrix"". And the next year I spoke with her once again. The same thing. This connection is overwhelming, that I was intoxicated and got crazy. Inability to sleep once again. And the later years (several) I was looking for truth. Lots of things experienced.And last year I discovered that concept, ""twin flames"". However, I struggled with understanding whether she was true or false one. I felt like this connection is special, though it doesn't go anywhere. Like how can I be with such a person, etc. And I got back always to her. I don't know, it resembles madness. Intoxicated madness. Up to the moment I said everything I wanted to say that was during the years of the past. I felt connected. Though, after saying everything I wanted — I liberated. Like the traumas of the past were removed from me. However, upon this liberation I've found out that this connection doesn't go anywhere further. THat person isn't into spirituality, looking for truth and closed from me, she even is a cold one. It was shown after the final talk.Later, I was thinking about it and even looked some tarot readings, like an addict. Even started to spawn an idea that this is just some clinging to the false hope. And weirdly, I started feeling said when I started to get away. I felt to high when I spoke with her, but now it is harsh to go on. I don't know whether this is a true twin flame or not, because it doesn't go anywhere. However, I had a dream this winter about ""7-10 months"". I had dreams about her this winter occasionally. Weird to say, that this doesn't work and I can't do anything about this, because the karma burdens were released. After the final talk I don't even know what to speak about with her. And I'm wondering, whether this is the end of the cycle. The further I go from it — the more pain I experience. And the only thing that struggles me — is it me clinging onto the false hope like some kind of anesthesia or this is really something important? What's distinction between those things? Because I don't want to watch those tarot readings, they don't show me anything and I just waste an hour per day (not much, though can be used for something else).I just ask, because I feel lost. I know this connection shook me (like that Led Zeppelin song, ""You Shook Me"") and lead me somewhere where I am now. I've made lots of things for me, opened new interests, views, etc. Also, I wonder, what is hidden behind ""clinging onto the false hopes""? It sounds for me like a replacement for life. However, those things come to me not when I'm in my things, actions. No! Just when I feel sad and blue. Weidly, but I had some weird feeling when I was in the university. I read some excerpts from some book during my class and there were lines about ""love, that only became real in the late life, when people became old"". That time I felt anxious and thought about this connection. I've never spoken about all of this and studied on my own. But now... I'm struggling. Ironically, prior to this I didn't believe in love, I thought modern people are more like ""worse than animals"", nothing deep, nothing profound. After my research I started to understand, that I experienced the wrong love. And love for me doesn't equal to having sex, because love can be just without having sex, just out of the definition of the word. Love is like an inner feeling with/without (some people are shy) expression of this feeling. However, if reading all those ""twin flame signs"", it can be this is just a false one. The only thing I crave is understanding why this ""false hope thing"" is still bothers me. After this connection I don't even know, whether I want to have a relationship, because those things shook me, definitely. I always was more ""lone wolf type"" and don't like when someone wants to tame me. Something like that. Any input would be appreciated, so as question/insights/help. Thank you."

So, here is the link about lack of sleep and possible Alzheimer's connection (increased risk):[https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/lack-rem-sleep-linked-increased-risk-dementia/](https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/lack-rem-sleep-linked-increased-risk-dementia/)Also, here it is necessary to remind that prolonged stress is also bad for the brain. So, to sum it up — prolonged stress and lack of sleep, it means that there is a possibility to develop something like that. Also, I remember there was a study, even in some newspaper about ""decreasing gray matter of the brain"" due to various drugs, like alcohol and caffeine. Prolonged stress also is not good for the gray matter. So, parallels are united, as it is seen. I'm just reading articles about sleep and how to ""better it up"", so hope it can be interesting for some.**edit:** another link, about dementia:[https://www.livescience.com/60216-decreased-rem-sleep-dementia-risk.html](https://www.livescience.com/60216-decreased-rem-sleep-dementia-risk.html)**edit 2:** one more:   [https://www.sleepresolutions.com/blog/rem-sleep-what-it-is-why-we-need-it](https://www.sleepresolutions.com/blog/rem-sleep-what-it-is-why-we-need-it)One of the important quotes from their is this:  **REM  sleep is also associated with learning new information** and maintaining  important neural pathways, according to new research published last  month in *Science*.Another quote:   **During  a full night of uninterrupted sleep**, our brains have an opportunity to  do some deep cleaning **to remove neurotoxins**, such as the waste products  of something called ***beta-amyloid***, which is found in people with Alzheimer's disease.   Another link to Alzheimer's disease."
none,"I don't remember whether I made posts like that. But I remember mostly tension moments of my life. I suppose, due to the inhibition of GABA, there are some problems of recalling the memories about one's life. Like a caffeinated person remember more about his/her ""stress/anxiety/phobia moments"", plus what others said. That's why even it is hard to comprehend. Like the life, that supposed to be for something, some purpose, living in happiness — turned into wormhole of unhappiness, which resembles illusion. Also, knowing that inhibiting effect of caffeine, there are definitely some problems with long-term memory, especially knowing that caffeine essence of ""being on guard"", ""fight-or-flight"", etc. Another harsh example, because caffeine withdrawal shows that the life prior to it was an illusion. That's why it is harsh. Stay strong, y'all. Like saying goes — difficult times beget strong men.**edit:** you know, interesting here also to remember that some people have problems with attention. Like short-term attention is fine (or even more jumping from one task to another), though prolonged one is a matter of some problem (even big, sometimes). Also read some materials that there is a problem in the nowadays people to maintain that attention."
none,"Imagine your state of mind on caffeine. Overactive reptilian brain, which is capable of doing ""survival things"", including that strong sexual appetite, closer to that getting rid of anxiety feeling. Also, recall from your memory, how you have been acting on caffeine. From my part, I can say that I used to act arrogant in some ways and cautious (even in the strongest sense). So, technically, quitting caffeine is like quitting that strong ego impulses, like weakening of ego itself. Ego and reptilian brain are interconnected. That's why there is a losing of sense of living off caffeine. Because survival function biochemically is weakened. Remember also that weakened sexual desire during decaffeinezation. No wonder it is easy to relapse, because this cycle of survival starts to go on once again. And the sense of life is also seemed to get back during relapse, though in the end once again it ends up with anxiety, panic and dysphoria. Like becoming a machine, that acts just on the survival mechanism. Remember how a person turns into some zombie during prolonged caffeination. Like more survival mechanism, less conscious, more even robotic. This suffering during decaffeination looks like egotistic agony, like it was big and now becoming little and little. Imagine some who has strong appetite. Imagine how lots of food are removed. How it feels like? Painful and lost of frustration. The other point of withdrawing is false sense of ""no one needs me"" or something. Don't fall into this trap. It's only temporal demotivation. At the same time just take a look at control ability. How it was hard to take control on caffeine and how it is easy to control off caffeine. Even fight back easier off caffeine. The other thing — taking responsibility for one's life, sometimes even to re-build life altogether."
none,"Remember how you first time find out the thing about caffeine, quitting caffeine, etc? For me it was in 2015-2016, when I though there was something about ""the caffeine thing"". At the same time I started nofap for the first time. Prior to all of this I was caffeinated and didn't even bother about this thing. Later, when I quit the first time, I felt better, though I was gluten-ated, so I hadn't got all the benefits from the healthy lifestyle. I got bacck to caffeine. That caffeinated was not that long, I started experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, even though I was going crazy in the bad way. Also, I was constantly obsessed about sexuality, I wanted to get laid with every woman I saw. Crazy horniness. Quit once again, though I ate casein and some gluten. Was always sluggish and sleepy after every consumption of dairy and/or gluten. Anxiety was prominent there, still. Caffeinated up to drug addiction, later started quitting gluten/casein. Started feeling better, caffeine high quickly turned into anxiety, dysphoria. What did I mean by this post? I mean that every time you quit caffeine, that ""honeymoon phase"" of high-ness decreases. Like, first time, for instance a month, next — two weeks, third time — a week. I mean, body literally tells get that shit out of my system, I don't want it anymore. The same thing I experienced with amphetamines. Like the more times you get back — the less high you experience. I don't know, though this axiom works pretty well. High dissipates quite quickly. In some case it is cool, because hypothetically a person would quit faster, though from the other side, that pleasure that was in the past hard to re-play once again. Something like that."
none,"You know, today I'm caffeine-free and fasted for several hours after the awakening and even have no urge to use any caffeine. I don't know, but this trick works for me. Like the feeling of caffeination weakens."
none,"I think combo of caffeine + sugar messed with my hormones, making me strongly obese. Even I've got some boobs. You know, I suppose kombucha is a good thing if someone is trying to quit Coca Cola or something like that. Temporarily. Though, I'm not sure entirely about kombuchas. Maybe, decaffeinated and based on real fruits it can be healthy, supposedly also with some healthy bacteria, like lactobacteria and something like that. Otherwise, I think it is no better than common caffeine in teas and coffees. Something like that."
none,"And the message in that paper was about the fact, that sometimes some toxins or wastes can be released, using this urinary tract. That's why this horniness can be felt, because toxins can be removed via that ""channel"". That's why possible relapses happen, increased horniness, sometimes even feeling ""obsessed with horniness"". Another point, as for me, that it shows only on the necessity of healthy diet and less unhealthy habits, like smoking, etc. I think less toxins the body contains — the less urges to relapse. And that was some paper, I don't remember its name, though the main point there was in several words about what I've said afore. Something like that."
none,"I've tried to ask this question on /kombucha, though no one responded about this thing. Though, I'm curious whether I can get an asnwer here. Hypothetically, it seems an interesting idea to brew coca tea, add some sugar to brew and put scoby there, when it is cold. I've heard in South America coca leaves are not illegal in some places. Though, I'm not sure for now, because I heard this several years ago. Imagine having this cold brew, taken from the fridge and drinking it during the summer. Sound awesome and elite, ha-ha. Anyone did something like that? If not, hope I've given some interesting idea to anons from South America. Cheers!"
none,"I'm more interested in valerian, mint, chamomile and other herbal variants of kombucha, because I want to try making something decaffeinated, because I know what caffeinated kombuchas taste like. Now I want something exotic, ha-ha. Also, it is interesting to hear from South American kombuchists, whether they tried to make kombucha, using coca leaves (yeah, sounds a bit ""druggy"", though I'm curious about the possibility). On yerba mate is also cool kombucha, liked that taste, even more pleasurable, than brewed yerba mate."
none,"Main message, from the first page, in the beginning: ""Caffeine was found to increase anxiety, depression, and hostility"".[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f29a/18c89b6f6d464e9398c898699451d555af5d.pdf](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f29a/18c89b6f6d464e9398c898699451d555af5d.pdf)"
none,"Just short message about unpleasant smell from my mouth. During those decaffeinated 2,5 weeks I hadn't paid attention to this matter. But after relapse I started to feel this thing. I'd finish that ""materials/articles cleansing"" and go decaf once again."
none,"Suddenly a thought spawned in my mind. What if due to caffeine effect happens various hormonal disbalances, like testosterone, estrogen, etc, etc? I mean it is obvious the fact that due to loads of cortisol and adrenaline in the body, there is a definite shift in the testosterone levels, which can be shown as belly fat, which indeed correlates with low testosterone levels. If taken from the female perspective, I've seen studies about how coffee, for instance, decreases the size of female breasts. From the biological perspective, when there is a danger (or artificial hormone disturbance, caused by caffeine) a woman can't feed her children. I mean what if caffeine intake can have some impairment for feeding of her child, for instance? I remember how my mother in the past had problems with feeding me properly, like she had problems with milk secretion. Here it is hypothetically possible to suppose, that caffeine has something with prolactin (lactating hormone). And from the danger perspective a woman can't feed her child, while there is some kind of a danger. So, probably that study about ""decreasing size of breast"" can have some truth in it.From hormonal and biological perspective, what if caffeine disrupts or impairs mating process? Like additional stress can give misinterpetation of those pair bondings? I mean, from biological perspective a pair can be bonded with a proper match on hormonal level. Like, if testosterone is low, a woman may have problem with seeing a man as a man. Here, also it is necessary to remind the fact, that sometimes it is possible to see those articles about a grand testosterone decline in men. Like, artificial sweeteners, bad diet, lack of sleep, etc, etc. No wonder family values also a bit shacken up. However, at the same time I can't deny the fact, that hormones also play magnificent role in the life of a human being. Also, I even saw some articles about low sperm count due to stress. Also, here I saw even some people said something about infertility, which also is connected to caffeine, stress, etc. I wonder, however to hear a female's perspective, because I can say those things, from my, male's perspective. However, I assume there is something on the other side. I know that testosterone level declines, when there is some load of stress. However, the most predominant hormone in a female is estrogen. I mean caffeine, due to stress may lower testosterone level in a male, though testosterone levels in a female is lower, than in a male. Which hormones are come into imbalances due to caffeine exposure? Or is it acting the same, but testosterone levels in women, which are by the biology itself are low, become even lower?I know that both sexes with prolonged stress can lead to fat gain (belly fat), loss of hair, sexual dysfunction, lack of sleep, anxiety, possible overeating, weak bones, impulsivity in actions and mood swings, depression. So, I suppose everyone is screwed up the same way, just on hormonal level. Now I wonder about how people can be screwed just on hormonal level for their entire lives. It's like living in an illusion, without entering into the full power of themselves. Like, not fully feeling masculinity and at the same time not feeling femininity, just on hormonal level. Just a hypothesis. And at the same time, feeding oneself with caffeine for the entire life, since childhood. No wonder, it's hard to quit, because there is a need to get back to the person that one should have become already with fully circulating hormones inside. And it may hard to get back to what supposed to be in full power, because there was a caffeinated life. Psychologically it may hard to adapt to this style, bestowed upon by nature. However, this caffeinated neuroplasticity can be changed into decaffeinated one. Just thoughts. I've always thought about ""tuning oneself"", like a guitar. And I've always known that there was something ""out of tune"", like sound is not that clean. Maybe, it's the last puzzle of this riddle, who knows."
none,"Technically, caffeine can affect microbiome, because stress affects microbiome in not healthy way. I've recently found some papers about link to changing of microbiome due to the prolonged stress. However, I wonder, maybe someone else has something, also? Also, I had a paper about how cigarettes / nicotine can change microbiome, too. I'll put it here, when I find it. Why I ask this question? Because gut and brain are interconnected. Gut feeling. Also, there was a post on /nootropics about those matters. Sorry, have no link for now, I just saw it several weeks ago and didn't save. If someone has something interesting, let's discuss or simply share."
none,"During decaffeination I was peaceful, though sad some times. On caffeine I'm more arrogant in some sense, robust, fast-moving, thus making mistakes. Speaking about physical exercises — on caffeine it feels more euphoric, than off caffeine. Second observation — on caffeine it is easier to run short distances, not long. So, after one circle I've screwed up in being tired. During decaffeinated times I could run twice more without being really tired. So, I'll get back on decaf. I relapsed just due to the fact I thought that there is something missing in that lifestyle. Plus, I needed to clean all of those materials I've been collecting since 2016-2017. I've always liked to discover details, which others can overlook. However, let's get back to observations. The longer a person stays high on caffeine — the more cons he/she gets. First 2-3 days were good, however I see its decline in efficacy. Long-term it is a failure. No wonder world is crazy. Constant fear, frustration, etc, etc. You know, sometimes I even have a feeling that people can't handle with care the things and plants that can be found in nature. Like addiction to living good and using everything and every time, even if there is no even need to use those things. And it's not only about caffeine, it's also about weed and other plants. Plants should be used as medicine or other herbs. I used weed, for instance, for spiritual purposes. I don't like laying on the coach and feeling stoned just for laying. All the post may sound quite in ""pro-using"" of some substances, herbs. I just say people experience problems with using herbs. Herbs should be used temporarily and for getting some effect. For instance, I like black tea for its activity on colon, thus making me poop easily (pardon my French). And after that ingestion I felt relieved. For instance, wormwood can be used as an aid for getting rid of worms or something like that. No one would use wormwood for getting high, because it is quite controversial about this matter (otherwise person can have problems with his/her health). All those feelings of getting high sometimes are used to escape reality. There is a thin line between using of something or escaping reality. For instance, speaking about caffeine. No wonder people use it, because they experience lack of energy. Why not asking yourself, why am I lacking of energy? What causes this? The same thing is about opioids. I used heroin and I know I tried to escape reality. I was in pain (emotional), that's why I tried to run. And in the end there is a need to find answers, to escape this feeling of ""escaping of reality"". No need to run. Have to find answers. Facing fears. Temporal relief can be gotten, just for the sake of getting the answers. And also, don't be hard on yourself, even if you're caffeinated. The time will come, when there would no need for caffeine. You may just searching for the answers. Time will come, believe me."
none,"I think it is interesting due to the fact, that it is like a psychitrist point of view.

none,"Please, read ""edit 2"" first in the end.So, since yesterday I've been trying to clean my PC from something is useful and something that is not, also to re-think all the materials I've gotten since 2016-2017 years. So, one of them is about neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. I've been always wondering about changing of myself, brain, etc. Neuroplasticity and neurogenesis once seemed to me quite an interesting topic, because I've always was interested about why some people change and why others don't. I assume, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are one of the topics that can shed light on some of these matters.So, here is the link:[https://www.psypost.org/2010/12/caffeine-suppress-neurogenesis-hippocampus-3083](https://www.psypost.org/2010/12/caffeine-suppress-neurogenesis-hippocampus-3083)Quote from there: "" **Moderate doses of caffeine may cause decreased proliferation of new  neurons by causing sleep deprivation and increasing anxiety.** On the  other hand, the increased physical activity caused by high doses of  caffeine may cause increased neurogenesis."". The second sentence is also important, because it is some kind of a relief from anxiety/tension, because exercise has something with releasing of endorphins (I'm not pro-caffeine, just replace ""caffeine"" with ""stress"" and you'd get the same picture).Another one:[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1748194/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1748194/)Title says about it all already. Also, in this subreddit people already posted something, relating to sleep. Especially those materials with Matthew Walker, so won't say anything more about this. I stress on the word ""neuroplasticity"" and ability to change, if to say it in plain words.Here's another one, though it is about alcohol, just found it in my folder about ""neuroplasticity"" and neurogenesis. I just leave it here, maybe some would find interesting:[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4568748/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4568748/)That's all for now, hope you enjoyed ""eating"" this food for thought.**edit: forgot to add the word ""neurogenesis"" in the title.****edit 2**: jeez, I'm a bit screwed up my information. It is more about neurogenesis, than neuroplasticity. Sorry, guys, I did it too fast and made several mistakes. The main idea that neurogenesis more connected with peace, lack of prolonged stress. The same thing is said about SSRIs, which increase neurogenesis (I saw that paper long ago, don't remember how it was called). Physical exercise also in handy for neurogenesis. **The main point here is loads of caffeine can impair neurogenesis in the same matter as stress and sleep deprivation do**. The next time I'll be more attentive."

none,"First of all I have to say that it may be too risky to say this way, though I'd give it a try. You know, I was decaffeinated for almost 2,5 weeks and I still struggled with tiredness, moodiness and even irritability. And now comes something interesting. My food preferences during decaffeination were some buckwheat with mushrooms, green smoothie — predominantly parsley, dates, apples, occasionally pumpkin / sunflower seeds, carrots, cabbages and other vegetables and fruits. One thing I've marked during this whole process — when I eat refined carbs, even in the forms of prepared buckwheat, green peas, rice or something I'm fine with — afterwards I feel tiredness, sleepiness, urge to even sleep. And here comes a major controversy. I was vegetarian for almost 4 years and vegan almost a year. What I want to say that I experience tiredness only after eating prepared food, while eating fresh vegetables and fruits (including dried ones) — I don't experience any tiredness. And now I wonder, what if raw food is the food that a man supposed to eat? This may be controversial to you, though for me I've got another puzzle. Last year I experimented with various drugs, including stimulants and opioids. And you know what? The feeling after eating of prepared food reminds me something of an opioid: the same tiredness, no even a wish to do anything, laziness, sleepness. It definitely reminds me an opioid (I was on heroin for some time in the past). Another reason why I say this — during decaffeination I experienced boobs growth as a male, which means I've got gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is connected with high levels of prolactin in the body. Side effect of using of opioids — increased levels of prolactin, plus low testosterone levels. Let me come from the other side. A person who has ever used antipsychotics (with some, especially old ones, like haloperidol) experienced the same rise in prolactin. What's about the prolactin, you'd ask. High prolactin is connected with moodiness, irritability, anxiety, cognitive problems (!), passiveness: imagine a pregnant woman with her mood swings. It's a high prolactin thing. Also, high prolactin levels are associated with low dopamine levels. And here comes the possible explanation why there is a feeling of un-motivation after eating a prepared meal. That's why a person takes his hand to the teapot and get his caffeine his, to alleviate this tiredness feeling. If a person is going to eat prepared food daily (make an experiment, if you don't believe me) — he or she would feel tiredness all day long, even drowsiness without any possibility to fully comprehend what others say. That's why caffeine, nicotine and other psychostimulants are in handy. The same thing comes to sensitivity to other dopamine things, like pornography, sex addiction, internet addiction and other things. Now, you may ask or say me, something like: man, are you serious, are you in your mind or something. I'd say all of this, because I've always felt that there is something wrong in this whole system, matrix. Beginning from the caffeine, eating weird food, cruelty, injustice, etc, etc. Even watching TV was a weird thing, weird show. Also, take a look — everywhere there are lots of caffeine, lots of various prepared foods. I don't say it's bad or good, I say that there is something in it. As for me, I've been always asking myself, what's the hype behind the raw food movement? I asked that question three years ago, though I wasn't ready. And for me here is the answer. And I got this answer, after going through lots of addictions, including heroin, just to find similarities in those things. And, I suppose, I should share this information with others. At least, for the case of curiousity, though quite controversial, because I've never seen here that someone would say something I've said afore. However, for me it looks obvious that there is something in it. Also, weird that there is no even proper prooves or research in the scientific community about those things (raw food). By this post I wanted to say that caffeine just gets rid of tiredness after eating of prepared foods. That's it. And my possible long answer. And yes, now I'm caffeinated, relapsed, because something's gone wrong. After this understanding I even felt a bit euphoric, like I've found some treasure chest. Something like that. Cheers!"
none,"You know, despite having this low-mood-ness, I observe my thoughts and feelings and I see how on caffeine I just medicated myself to numb that long-lasting pain. I even suppose that on caffeine it is not even possible to re-think and overcome some traumas, actually. Like on caffeine there is a possibility constantly re-feeling those events in the mind, obsessively, without an ease. Also, knowing how I was shallow on caffeine, no wonder I couldn't reach the depths of those ""miseries"". It was not possible, however now it is. I see how my mind tries to trick me, like seeing those nude pictures in my mind. Like my mind wants to anesthesize himself, to get rid of that pain, because it is hard to face it. However, those thoughts pass and I lay in misery for a while. I mean, it's inevitable anyway and I don't want to run anymore. Knowing also that most people drink caffeine, I can hypothesize if those people are going to withdraw from caffeine, they'd also reach this ""dark night of the soul"", because eventually everyone shall meet their own fears. It's inevitable. For me caffeine postponed only this action. Yes, it's painful, though it is a must. Because, imaging, if there is nowhere to go, like you've found yourself near the wall, surrounded by those things that you've been running away since that first caffeinated sip? I literally embrace those feeling, writing a diary and listening that sad music, because I have no even motivation to do anything for now. However, it should be for now, because I was like a hamster, running on the wheel. Now it's time to rest and heal the ""core wounds"". Something like that. Hope you're doing well, also."
none,"Yeah, it may be a bit odd, though I experienced something like that. Like occasional laughter seemed to be about me, like some kind of paranoia. On decaf there is no such a feeling. It is weird how tremendous this feeling seems to appear. It looks like definitely of delusionary origin. See, how the responses on caffeine are more ego-driven, with like ""everything and everyone is against me"" feeling? Imagine if lots of people feel the same. Collective anxiety, collective neurosis, collective delusion. Seems to be creepy."
none,"Have you heard the phrase ""gut feeling""? Intuition? You know, on decaf I've started to feel what I really have and need to do. Like not that prolonged thinking of what I should do, no. Just a thought sparks in my mind and I do it, because intuitively I know that the thing should be done. For instance, this post is a product of that ""intuitive spark"". Just food for thought. Cheers!"
none,"I remember in the past I used to eat various beans — red and white ones. I remember I felt sluggish, which was the reason why I got back on caffeine. I've been eating prior to eating beans some buckwheat with mushrooms. And I've found out now why I kept relapsing on caffeine, because I have intolerance to beans (white, red). I mean check it out what you eat, who knows, what if your withdrawing from caffeine (especially that long) can be just some food intolerance.  On caffeine such a thought wouldn't come into my mind. Why I say this thing, you ask, how I've found out this? Bloating, some muscle pain, dizziness, even headaches. Take a glance at what you eat and study this thing, it may be helpful.edit: also forgot to say, that I feel anxious. And it happens some time later, after ingesting of those beans. Technically, it can be due to the reaction on histamine. Ironically, at the same time, anti-histamines have interesting effects — anti-allergy and an aid for sleep, aka hypnotics. The same benadryl is a classic anti-histamine."
none,"You know, during this short decaffeination I started to see more things. Like, I used to look for some company, people with whom I wanted to speak about. Even those, who played their roles in the past, however now don't play any role. Like they did their work to get me here, to this moment. Second, I want to stress this sentence on the fact, that I looked for relationships just for the sake of it, like to feel this intoxication and get away from myself. Love played for me as a role of an escape mechanism. Like I used to be in that feeling and forgot about myself. Like filling the void with other person. Third, I used to participate in drug binges, which were intresting in some sense, though I was not that close to myself, also ran away in some sense. Also, the other important thing that I've found out — slave mentality. Like on caffeine a person is pushed to do something, even unrelated to his or her life-journey. And off caffeine there is a vivid feeling of this void, even with the thought ""what have I done with my life?"". That's why possible relapse happens, due to this realization. Metaphorically, if we draw a picture, it would be looking like a master is caffeine and the person is his slave. And without this ""master"", a person should find what he or she should do. Sometimes freedom can be even anxious, that one doesn't know what for freedom is. Also, I remember constant watching of youtube videos on caffeine — useful and not, just for the sake of watching. Now I don't even really know what for I was doing this. Hilarious, however partially entertaining. And it was really hard to see through this ""caffeinated glass"", really hard. Only during sobriety I see this. Toxic relationships also were hard to differentiate for me from un-toxic ones."
none,"The first week was good, slow but good. I enjoyed this easiness. Now, I wonder, is it caffeine withdrawal anxiety or something else? Several days ago my mushrooms supply ended and I stopped eating buckwheat with a bit fried mushrooms. What if anxiety is caused by the absent of this combo food (carbs + a bit of fat (oil) + mushrooms)? Today I also have eaten several cans of white beans. I've heard also in some people there is a possibility to have food allergy on beans. How that thing was called... Forgot. I just experience after eating of white beans (canned) some kind of tiredness and I fart a lot (pardon my French). Why can also be beans suspected, because today I've eaten only white beans with carrots, plus dates. A bit later I'd eat something else, like green smoothie. Anyone has an allergy on beans? I know that tiredness also may be due to high salt intake, though I assume this is not this case.edit: found out information. It's about lectins.edit 2: possible anxiety due to allergy, link:[https://www.mygenefood.com/blog/pollen-allergies-cause-anxiety/](https://www.mygenefood.com/blog/pollen-allergies-cause-anxiety/)"
none,"Have anyone researched this topic and interaction? I mean, I've already done a topic about less empathy on caffeine, due to the fact that anxiety do something vice-versa, instead of empathy (dis-empathy or something). The same is aggression. Now I wonder, what about that love hormone, called phenylethylamine? Technically, during caffeine it can be felt as an intense feeling of anxiety. Like, you know, if being in love creates something a bit anxious, due to the nature of phenylethylamine (and related compounds), caffeine only increases anxiety, which can make even the sense of love-romantic relationship be felt more anxious and uncomfortable. I don't know, I just hypothesise due to the interaction of both stimulants — phenylethylamine, which itself is a natural stimulant, a ""love hormone"", plus caffeine — which is known to increase anxiety: those observations show that romantic relationships from biochemical view more pleasurable off caffeine, than on caffeine, due to additional anxiety. Also, it is possible to say that those relationships can be even healthier, than on caffeine, due to un-inflated ego, which is the effect of all-known psychostimulants. Also, knowing they may be even deeper, than on caffeine. I don't know entirely, I just hypothesised what I've known already. Any more additional insights would be interesting to add. Thanks.edit: short link about the phenylethylamine:[https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-phenylethylamine.htm](https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-phenylethylamine.htm)"
none,"I'm a bit nostalgic now, because I remember how lots of notes I did, how lots of things I tried to research while on caffeine. Now, I have peace, moving not so fast, sometimes even feel extra need for information, getting something new, etc. Partially, I think I'm bored. Even have a delusion about that I know everything that I need and this a bit horrifies me. Like... knowing everything I want? Like mysteries of life are smashes and it's a bit saddening to me. I remember on erowid it was stated that caffeine reduces boredom. What if this state of mind is just reversed effect, like boredom gets back with all its intensity, which was suppressed in the past by large amount of caffeine? I have no other explanations, apart from this ""adenosine thing"" and restoration of the sleep cycles. What do you feel? Do you experience the same boredom? I even go outside for running and I'm still bored. Crap, it's a bit unpleasurable, frustrating. However, at the same time there is a thought that I ran on caffeine extremely fast and now I just should be stopped for a while (almost 1,5 weeks already), to ""acclimatize"". Like ""stop raping yourself"" or something like that."
none,"You know, I was not so long ago in the supermarket, packing carrots and weirdly, but I sensed the smell of onions was too strong, like I've never felt on caffeine. Also, I've been wandering whether I was gasping for air during caffeination. Like, you know, fight-or-flight, short breath, etc, etc. Now I breathe slow and deep. But smell... it was really strong, I haven't even touched those onions. And no one did so, while I was there. Magnificent, I have no other words to say this."
none,"I don't know how to describe this otherwise. On caffeine my parents tended to quarrel with me, when I was on caffeine. Even my brother acted a bit cocky, like he can insult anyone. Off caffeine there is nothing like that, no quarrels. And, interestingly, I'm more sure about the things I stand for. However, this thing, mentioned afore, a bit intrigues me. Why people react differently, when I was on caffeine and off caffeine? Scientifically I don't know how to explain this, however it is possible to say like ""on caffeine I was on fear/anxiety frequency"", that's why it was somewhat uncomfortable. I have no other words to say this otherwise. Interesting to hear, maybe I am not alone on this matter? Share your experience, observations, if you have any, would be interesting to read."
none,"I've known that I wanted to enrich my language vocabulary and suddenly during decaffeination I started to see that I don't use those obscene words at all. Even when I am pissed off I just show what I don't like, instead of ""wtf"" and other expressions. For me it's like a some kind of a bonus, because I've seen how my language degrades when I used more foul words. And off caffeine it became easier to do so. Something like that."
none,"You know, it may sound a bit hilarious, however, apart from the today's dream, I had one more, several years ago, when I heard vividly the message with the words ""coffee is a devil's brew"". Just read several weeks ago my dream journaly and it was interesting to read something like that. Today's I'm got back to decaffeination, so journey continues. Hope you're doing well, peace!"
none,"Like I remember those first caffeine days, stimulation, good, going well, later subsiding, subsiding and turning into anxiety, panic, paranoia, even delusions. So, the longer you use it — the more delusional you can become. So, I suppose my accumulating caffeine stress theory seems to work. And, from this theory follows the other conclusion, that caffeine should not be used prolongedly, at all. Like, for instance, a person gets a painkiller for some time, the same approach to caffeine, like it is a psychoactive drug, that should be used only temporary. However, better to be without caffeine at all. I assume, from some point caffeine was in handy, when Europe was into alcohol, like ""a sober-ing drug"". Now, per se there is no need for caffeine at all. No need to hurry either."
none,"You know, prior to this I was peaceful. Now I feel like I'm awake, though like in the alert state of mind. Recently I've installed Doom: Eternal game and found out that without caffeine it is even ""lazy"" to play this, while caffeinated reaction is increased due to that caffeinated alertness. However, I'd say that I looked more into details while I was decaffeinated. On caffeine it seems like I can easily overlook the secret areas, like exploration of areas seem to be a bit neurotic, anxious with an urge to shoot if necessary. By this I mean on decaffeinated lifestyle I take a glance more into details, while on caffeine I tend to see the whole picture, even in neurotic sense (like get rid of this thing that creates tension, ""out of sight, out of mind mentality"").Second, I've found out also that during decaffeination I started to dislike violence at all. Like why do cruel things at all? However, on caffeine this thing seems a bit less important, because there is a need to defend in the game. Another point, I've recently suddenly found some David Icke's video about reference to the reptilian brain, which reminds me that ""caffeinated state of mind"", when the person is in the state of alertness and see others as adversaries and foes. Like some kind of an egocentric mind with being hostile to the others. I even found out myself in those weird situations with ""holy wars"" in the Internet, when I thought that I should prove others that they were wrong, especially remembering old caffeinated situations. I even saw commentaries of others as a threat. Yeah, sounds hilarious, especially there is no need to answer everyone.Third, the end. I finally got the point that caffeine just a mental prison, which makes a person act more like an animal with an instinct of a predator. I sometimes on caffeine even caught myself in the situations, when I tended to show supremacy on caffeine. Yeah, need more psychological work, I know . I'd say why I even relapsed. I felt a bit depressed today and did it. I don't know, like inner voice said me to do it, gut feeling or something, maybe. The other thing was a breakup with the narcissist, when I was ""high"" when spoke with her. If somebody was with a narcissist — they'd understand what I mean. It felt like a high, like some kind of a stimulant with a hornified feeling and inability to sleep with later feeling of being drained. And partially, I was going through 2 withdrawals, first — caffeine, the second — narcissist (like quitting some strong stimulant, a drug which gives a purpose in life, though in reality it is just a toxic relationship with the feeling of high). And I quit her due to decaffeinated state of mind. On caffeine I obsessively wanted to get her back (yeah, sounds a bit crazy). So, I'd get back waking up in the morning and I'll quit caffeine at all. I just was inspired by Mathew Walker's sleep thing and by myself found out that I felt more refreshed, when I woke up early. I feel even by my body how it is uncomfortable to wake up late (after 9 am in the morning). I've written this a bit chaotic, however let it be. Thanks.edit: forgot to add, that horniness also is increased a bit in agitated way, while off-caffeine I was comfortable, peaceful. For me it only describes that caffeine only increases horniness in a bit ""obsessive way"". There is definitely difference between caffeinated. I tried to watch at women on caffeine and off-caffeine. In the first case I felt warm and a bit excited feeling, while in the second — more horny feeling. So, I assume relationships are also deeper off caffeine, when on caffeine, due to more deep contact, not only like a male and a female, but more like a man and a woman (the first ones are description of genders, while the second is something more, of a human). Like caffeine is an inhibitor of going deep or something."
none,"Weird, I'm decaffeinated, though have sleep problems still and it is a bit pissing me off. Like, what the heck? Why can't I wake up early and go to sleep early? Btw, is anyone has sleep problems recently, even decaffeinated? Yesterday I got to sleep too late, though couldn't go early. Now, I'm looking for a formula of how to get to sleep earlier. The only thing, that comes to my mind is to do fasting — sooner or later it will definitely knock me down in the blissful sleep. As always I got some sunshine, so I don't forget sunbathing. Maybe there is some need to do something else?"
none,"Just interested in the experiences of others and how they had been changed since then. I've found in myself like I had some anger, though now it seems to be more transmuted, like used to do some things, actions, etc, etc. Like I want to do things and I hadly even pissed off on others, which is like a miracle. I think I was even more into the mentality of a victim, like others made me or something."
none,"First, on caffeine there are feeling of either anger/aggressiveness or anxiety/fear, which means there is no empathy at all. At least how can you be empathic, if you feel fear? You'd run away or hide or deal with the issue. Second, off caffeine there is a feeling of compassion, empathy, which I hadn't had on caffeine. Third, I remember how I experimented with MDMA and remember this empathic, though mroe forced. MDMA acts on serotonin receptors. Fourth, my hypothesis that caffeine messes up the serotonin system. Why am I thinking this way? Because, as far as I remember, caffeine messes up with sleep, hence problems with melatonin secretion, and melatonin is secreted from serotonin. By all of this I mean, if serotonin system is active and there is a proper amount of serotonin in the body, a person feels less irritability, more conscious, less impulsive. The other thing, my experiments with MDMA, due to the fact that MDMA increases oxytocin levels, plus serotonin ones. Hence, it is possible to suppose, that off caffeine person can restore his or her serotonin levels (and melatonin, due to restored sleep) and maybe his or her oxytocin level will be normal back again, also. It's an experimental statement, I just got it during meditation, though sounds interesting, as for me. Any additions are welcomed. Ah, also during meditation I've understood that it's great to partake in this ""/decaf movement""."
none,"In the shower I've been thinking about how I found myself in this weird, toxic relationship situation. And off-caffeine I've come to conclusion that I have no any bond with that person, even no mutual interests, nothing. The only thing I felt only some anxiety. I come to the point that during decaffeination I started to get some insights, including this one. As far as I remember, while being caffeinated, I had something with that person, weird bond, based on anxiety. I wrote in another post how conscious decision are more often off-caffeine, like finding proper friends, interests, etc, etc. What if relationships, being based on caffeine, can also be misleading? In my situation I thought that person had something, though she did not. She did not even have an interest in me. It's odd, however I can say that perception is really different now. I don't know, really, what I was waiting or wanting from her, being caffeinated. Probably, I even wasn't that interested even, like this person was not even for me, no synergy at all. However, nice lessons are got. What are your stories about ""caffeinated relationships""? Has something changed on caffeine-free lifestyle? What's main difference do you see between being caffeinated and decaffeinated in the relationships?"
none,"I remember how I compulsively reloaded my social web pages, like constantly waiting for an answer from other person. Even reddit was the same. And now, before even entering reddit once again, I asked myself, why am I acting so? Like I was outside, jogging for some time, it was really great. Came to home and wanted to visit reddit and asked myself, why am I going there, if I still hasn't taken a shower after the jogging? And I went to the shower. I don't know, but it may be that all compulsive behaviors have something close to the caffeinated state of mind. Like it enhanced my urge to escape, my some escapist tendencies. Something like that."
none,"Always hurrying, never resting. Also, I've found out that some my hurryings were quite unsuccessful. I don't remember vividly, but there was a proverb about hurrying, like ""more haste, less speed"" or something like that. Btw, it would be interesting to see other proverbs on this topic. Also, ironically, I tried to run quick, hurry and even when I hurried, I was late. Irony of fate, no other words can describe this. And now, on decaf (no caffeine) I go on slow. Even enjoy the moment of going slow. I don't know, it can be described as ""being high on easiness"", like enjoy going slow. I think this is the taste, that the society forgot about."
none,"I don't know, how can it be, though I never cared deeply about myself on caffeine. Like I remember feeling anxious, feeling like what others thought me. But I never thought about myself really deeply. Even self-care was not so sufficient, like I've started to experience on decaffeinated lifestyle. It shocks me, really. Also, I've found out, that when a person experiences caffeinated anxiety, I think it is even impossible to understand and show feelings, that are deep. Like even love seems to be anxious. Anxious love. It reminds me fear of losing something. And I was raised with this ""caffeinated love"", where was fear, not pure love. And after this I've even come to understanding that I was raised out of purpose of survival, not love. I don't know, love seems to be giving patience, piece, joy. But it was more anxiety. So, I think people don't feel deep due to caffeine. Like heart is closed or something like that. I'm a bit romantic, probably spring awakened me, ha-ha."
none,"I read once in the past that there is such a symptom like insomnia during decaffeination. Even I remember it was on caffeineinformer, as far as I remember. It's a bit tricky thing for me, because during first days I experienced good sleep and now (today and yesterday) I had not such a good sleep, though today I had dreams, which is a positive thing. How long will it take to get through this ""withdrawal insomnia""? Also, I feel a little bit anxious, though it is not that intense, that on caffeine was. Or is it just an ""up-and-down thing"", like temporary swinging from up to down with coming to align with my natural state (decaffeinated)? Like that sinusoid line? What's your experience?"
none,"I find sometimes myself acting a bit pissed off on off-caffeine lifestyle. And I'm curious, when those feeling will change into something more peaceful, delightful? I just see how sometimes I express cruel words while decaffeination. Occasionally, also, a bit pissed off by some weird things, like ignorance, stupidity, even amongst my family members. It can be also due to the fact, that I had been struggling with anxiety, which meant like anxiety suppressed my natural libido. And now this is the reversed effect, like there was suppression, now it is expression (almost poetic, ha-ha). When all those hormonal levels and other things will stabilize? How long did it take for you?"
none,"I don't know, it's weird. Like on caffeine I could have done lots of things, primarily in the sense of ""obsession"", like sticking to it, while off-caffeine I do the things that I really want. Also, on caffeine I experienced some kind of a doubt in making some things, even the things that definitely should be done. Even making something new was hard, like some kind of restriction to break the shackles. Off caffeine I really do things that I want, have no doubts in making something new and really useful. I think all my life I was in doubts, however it was harder to get over them. While off caffeine I have less need to overcome them, they aren't even that strong to take some additional action. No thoughts like ""what others say"", ""what for"", etc, etc. Like all those thought constructions that just fooled me, not letting go onwards. Something like that. Caffeine free = doubt free. Peace."
none,"Now I've understood, what peace is. And how even a little bit of caffeine gives the sensation of anxiety. Just saying. Tomorrow I'll continue tasting what peace is.  Hope, you'd also get some peace (if not getting already). Peace!"
none,"Jeez, I'm really feeling now like I'm withdrawing with some kind of a ""poisoned sense"". Sluggishness, constipation, a bit slow thinking, my eyes like red (i.e., inflammated). Holy smokes, this is really unpleasant. I'll get some grapes and go outdoors. Maybe sun will ease my uneasiness. You know, it's like my life is under an earthquake, due to no caffeination. Weirdly also the thing, that when I started quitting it, I found out I started to feel sick. I even slept today for 12+ hours. Never slept so much since 2017-2018. Also, now have some muscle pain. Hope this will subside the following days.edit: forgot to add, that nyktophobia went away the first day when I started being decaffeinated. Really easy went to sleep in darkness. Weird to understand that this thing had been since my schoolyears."
none,"Don't know, whether I did it in the past, though during running today I've found out that I run from stress into videogames, overeating, etc, etc. I even think that those defensive mechanisms work every day. Like we're artificially protecting ourselves during caffeination. Like some kind of a trained animal in a zoo. Like everyone deals with stress differently. And those mechanisms work everytime when there is a sip of caffeine. Constant stress only strengthens this mechanism, like remembering. Even depression is a defense mechanism, because depression weakens response to stress. And this defense mechanism, this response to stress is like some kind of ""negative neuroplasticity"", like being tuned to the fake self. Feeling not oneself, but some weak version of a person, driven by fear. I'd say that society is driven by fear. And everyone copes with stress really different. Like blurred, caffeinated glass of delusion. Defensive mechanisms are really connected with learned behavior, whilst the first is a response, the second — the outcome of this learned response. Quitting caffeine equals changing life. Changing attitude, changing modi operandi."
none,"That's weird. Throughout this day the only things I've done, were something closer to food, sleeping and yawning. Now I have a though of getting some ginseng or something like that. You know, I even have extremely high laziness to do physical exercises. Especially knowing that I have some muscle pain. The other option I have is to get some piracetam or eat something spicey with chili pepper, that's it. Any other suggestions? Ah, also it is possible to make a green smoothie.edit: title ""what do you do"".edit 2: found one report from the man, who used ginseng for quitting caffeine:[https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83954](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=83954)"
none,"You know, I've found out that definitely constant stress breaks down muscle mass, transforming it into the fat tissue. Also, I have a supposition that I may experience fatty liver. Why? I think constantly metabolizing caffeine without a single rest can be part of it. Also, recently I've started to experience muscle pain, which can be an essence of medical condition, called rhabdomyolysis. Also, hypoxia, lack of oxygen in the body, which also weakens proper function, because oxygen is a must for the body and the function of the brain. Irregular heartbeat and heart palpitation also a common thing from the contant stress, which can be a reason with the heart, weakening of it. Also the immune function. I remember something, called ""shortening of telomeres"" or something like that, when immune function work is impaired or weakened — it leads to other detrimental effects, like illnesses, which can be easily got, while stressed. Something like that. For me it was an early insight, placed everything in order."
none,"Yeah, I'm still caffeinated, though today I've found that caffeine tends to create additional noises in understanding of things. Like it pushes to find something useful, though its distractive nature can mislead into the wrong direction, plus pleasurable sensations that can overwhelm you, thus you can forget what you wanted to do prior to this. Weirdly, though I think caffeine just holds up me in the ""animalistic nature"", like I'm not fully aware who am really I. Like some ego-driven mechanism, that eat, drink and do some neurotic things. I think I'm done with caffeine. Recently I've started to see, that it just inhibits my growth, making me just ""eat, sleep"", like to be just an animal. Like I've lost my purpose for a while. Caffeine stimulates in the manner that will lead to ignorance. I think the whole essence of caffeine tends to be delusional. I think, due to this, it can be misleading, distracting from searching the truth. P.s.: yeah, I know, I've said something like that already. Probably I just need some push to get to decaffeinated area. Ha, like caffeine-free area, which reminds me ""no-smoking area"", ""no caffeine area""."
none,I remember how I did once poppy tea and it was a bit relaxing (though I used all 50 g to make this beverage). Anyone tried doing this or is it just waste of time?
none,"You know, I've read about monks, who were into hermiting or something like that. And interesting, that they had interesting thoughts about solitude, about being and liking this state of being. Hypothetically, to be in solitude for some time can be like a detox from the social constructs. I haven't left house for a week and I was peaceful, doing my things, etc, etc. Today I went to the shop and understood that I don't like those places, like they give additional noise to life, which is quite unnecessary. No point at all. And I'm not even sure, that a person should be amongst lots of people daily. Is it even necessary? I highly doubt it. You know, in the past I liked to befriend new people. Though, now I understand that on social media, in those ""webs"", lots of people are not even friends, just some acquaintances. Occasionally they are even temporary, like ""speaking about something and later losing sense and need for a connection"". And ironically, during my schoolyears it was the same. I didn't even care for people. I wasn't even interested. Just spoke a bit, that's it. And knowing those social constructs, rooted in the social media, arises the following question: anyone tried to be in the hermit mode for several months, a year? I mean, this could be quite an enriching experience, which can lead to the things that a person really needs in life. Even qualities, how someone should be, due to the qualities, inner wisdom, if it is possible to say so. I see solitude as detoxing of the qualities or ""values"", that have no even need and can be destructive. You know, even a week of semi-solitude (in my stance it was not so much talking at all, just in need), I started coming closer to my real self. I don't know, it's like that ""Matrix"" movie, where the blue pill is like doing what others do and the red pill is like going on throughout the journey to find what is really important. It definitely reminds me some kind of detox. That's why I'm questioning about this. I don't know, the closer I'm becoming to myself — the better I understand, that all these things in the society just some kind of noise, that blinds a person from what surely should be done. Not those ""career things"", ""alpha male blah-blah-blah how much you got laid"". I even suppose that this subreddit's main theme should be some kind of getting rid of ""slave mentality"", because it definitely cripples a lot, putting shackles on the hands. Even addictions remind me some kind of shackles. I think, self-improvement should be based around ""finding the key"" to get rid of those shackles.P.s.: if someone practised hermitting without self-harm or something, I'd like to hear your stories."
none,"You know, I tried kombucha in different forms — common black tea, green tea, milky oolong,  Tieguanyin, pu'er tea (shēngchá), coffee-based, cocoa-based, hibiscus, chicory. And I think caffeine rush is present, though it is not the same as from the common brewed beverages. Also, I think some artificial sugar is present. I don't know, I have the same feeling after drinking caffeinated kombucha, like I've eaten some sweets. I don't know how describe it, like some eye inflammation or something like that, it will closer to what I experience. And after those experiments I think caffeine in kombucha still has its effect on the body and on mental health, remembering also there is some sugar content, which I felt like some eye inflammation. And, I wonder, what other people experienced. And also I wonder, does that ""ancient kombucha"" was the same as today's one? Or it was something different? What have you experienced? What are your experiences with kombucha, comparing to caffeinated beverages? As for me, I think I'd quit even using of kombucha, due to caffeine content, plus artificial sugars in the form of white sugar can be felt. So, two reasons, as you can see."
none,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/fa923e/cocoa\_kombucha\_ending\_of\_the\_experiment\_30\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/fa923e/cocoa_kombucha_ending_of_the_experiment_30_days/)So, it still has taste of ""pseudo-wine"", taste reminds me of wine or champagne, but without bubbles. However, I assume with adding some fruits and put it into the second fermentation, it would be something like champagne. I don't know, used 10 tsps of raw cocoa powder + 1 cup of sugar (brewed for 30 days). So, in my case I've got an alcohol drink, a bit stronger than kvass or something like that. And, I'd try to use in cooking, because I don't want to just spill it out into the toilet. And the taste is not that sweet, more wine-like. So, if someone is interested, you can make cocoa kombucha, which would be more alcohol-esque. I can attest that, because I remember that warmness in the throat, which happens after alcohol imbibing. Not that strong, though it is indeed there. The only question remains in my head — was there cocoa too much? I think, if my receipe didn't work, maybe someone else tries this, but with less cocoa. I'm honestly already a bit fed up with kombuch'ing, gotta take a break. So, I've made my contribution to the topic of ""cocoa and kombucha"", ha-ha.**edit, 18.03.2020**: tried to cook mushrooms, using this brewed substance and found out later that mushrooms are sweet. Added some salt (mixed with spices), red chili pepper and turmeric. And you know, the flavor is still a bit weird. So, I suppose it's not good idea to cook something, using brew, based on cocoa kombucha. Also, funny, I've found out that when I pour this liquid onto my finger (which is an opened wound) and felt like it is an antiseptic, which proves that it has ethanol. Also, I imbibed a little of this liquid and later felt inebriated, like impaired reaction, a little bit stupid giggling (as for me it is). Hence, I shall admit that cocoa kombucha is not worth it, because it is an alcoholic drink and if you want to make this, keep it maximum 14 days, because later it will transform into an alcoholic beverage. And it's not that handy in cooking (or maybe some gourmet can find how to use it, I don't know), so for me it's useless. Stick to black/green/oolong/pu'er teas, which worked for me. Ah, also coffee can be used."
none,"Hi. I'm questioning you because I quit in the past lots of sugary things (I mean refined sugar like in cakes, ice-cream, etc, etc). And, in the light of that, during the experimentation with kombucha I still have the feeling of that ""refined sugar thing"". I know that kombucha is not entirely sucrose, some of it is glucoronic acid, etc, etc. Still, the taste still feels like of sucrose. Is there any possibility to make kombucha the other way? Or just there is a need to hold kombucha a little longer? I only had a thought of making kombucha with using of fruits, like grapes or something, though I'm not sure whether would it work, so don't know. Any thoughts?"
none,"While cooking, the though arose in my head about influence of caffeine on parenting. I mean, if a person can be anxious (even more than usual) about himself, so why can't it be extrapolated into other spheres of life. Like micro anxiety and macro anxiety, like if a person alone or with somebody, like family. And, in families, if a person too anxious, he or she can have fear about his children, intensified by caffeine, why not supposing this? And, due to anxiety, parent can be controlling due to his anxiety about children's mistakes, etc, etc, which can be a reason for creating of traumas and other psychological problems, like infantilism, like a person already seems to be a mature one, however childish in some sense due to inhibition caused by the parent's anxiety. My post is an expiremental questioning, because if anxiety experienced alone — it's the one thing, and if anxiety experienced with somebody — it's different. That's why I'm interested in how caffeine affects parenting, and I'm curious to hear stories about parents caffeinated parenting and decaffeinated parenting, its differences. I suppose it should be at least interesting, because I haven't seen something like that. Hypothetically and intuitively, I think there is something in it, though I require ""life samples"", practical experiences to see whether my theory has some ties with living examples. Thanks in advance!"
none,"It may be a bit hilarious, however on caffeine I've found out lots of stuff that I was (and still) interesting in. And it may be weird, but I have a feeling that I'll lose interests for some things. I don't know, maybe it's just like hard to let go of something, especially if something has been researched for quite long. Also, I fear that my points of view on things would change, when I go off-caffeine. And it may sound hilarious, however... like on caffeine I was always alert, even alert in terms of the information I got from people, I even sometimes felt suspiciousness, even from those who are close to me. Like constant defence against other ideas or something. Like fear of losing this alertness, defensiveness, something like that. Because I remember in the past, when I went off-caffeine for several timess, I showed later some naivete about some things. Like fear to be befooled. At the same time, anxiety with feeling of ""not my life"". And, overall, it's like to let go of life, that wasn't even mine. Maybe, it's just a fear of change. And it's weird. It's like defense against quitting drugs or something. I hope if go off caffeine I wouldn't lose the things I've done and would not be naive this time. Now, I have no choice, so gotta check once more, trying to get to the other side."
none,"You know, I really had those feelings, like my attention directed outwards, like constant panic to find the threat or something like that. On caffeine it is really act the same, at least during mid stages of caffeination up to quitting (like beginning phase is feeling high, floating, cool, etc, etc, later subsiding). And off caffeine there is no need to search a threat inside, like one's fool and no need to add something else. Peace as it is. I remember how I was in the forest several years ago and just laid on the grass. It was really peaceful and off-caffeinated. My point is on caffeine — attention directed outwards, like searching something in the world, whilst off-caffeine is attention direction into the person, inwards, like everything is present already inside or something. As for myself, I'll finish my experiments with kombucha and quit. I've quit coffee, that's the first step. Second step is also done, I've lost something interesting in green and black teas. Cocoa — never was a fan, only liked chocolate, though quit a year ago. Pu'er tea — I wasn't fascinated entirely, like coffee but from the tea world or something. Only oolong tea remains, at least today. Something like that."
none,"Has your memory improved? Changed a little bit? Or more? Is your memory better, in comparison with caffeinated state of being? What's else improved on the decaffeinated lifestyle in terms of memory?"
none,"Continuing from that post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/f4zrfp/new\_kombuchist\_here\_have\_a\_question\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/f4zrfp/new_kombuchist_here_have_a_question_about/)So, first 10 days it was fine — sweet, reminding common kombucha, brewed on black tea. And after 12-14 days it started to get some alcohol in it. Like the taste started to being more bitter. After 20 days mark I started to get warm feeling in my throat, after taking several of it from a little cup. And now, 30 days mark, I can vividly attest that it has alcoholic properties. The taste reminds me like a ""half a road to the wine"" thing. Like it reminds wine, but a bit different, though bitterness is really close to the wine's one.So, I used the following receipe: 3 l glass jar, 10 teaspoons of cocoa powder, a cup of sugar (250-300 ml), a scoby, that's it. Liquid approximately 2,7-2,8 l. Now I wonder, whether can I do something with it to change its taste, like adding more sugar (which, I suppose only will give more alcohol content). Or is it possible to use in cooking, because I don't like the idea to get rid of this stuff. Weird cocoa brewed stuff, ha-ha. Any ideas? Btw, scoby is alive and it's really thick. No mold detected. I have a thought, also, whether I put not so much sugar, which caused such a taste, or the brewing of kombucha on the cocoa ends up the same, like the liquid with predominant alcohol content. I don't know. The only point, that wonders me — the sugar content. Is it enough sugar to be brewed or not? I assume there is only one way to understand. To do it the same way, but with 2 cups of sugar. Something like that. By this post I wanted to say, that my brew has failed, so if you want to try brewing on cocoa, do it the other way, because in my receipe something's missing. Any assumptions are welcomed here."
none,"You know, it's hard really to detox from this lifestyle, when you go through the school, university and get some job. Like cattle going to be slaughtered. And the main point is that it's hard to go the other way, like to get rid of the mentality of a slave is really hard. Like to be programmed since childhood, with the milk of a mother. Like we're taught to be ""independent by dependence"", so-called ""normies"", ""wagers"", etc, etc. Instead, should be independence with finding one's own way. Like everyone have their special, unique paths, but instead of going them we ingest the prepared ways. And it's really hard to find this authentic way, especially working with the thoughts and programmes, which were put into the mind. Like hard to get rid of a slave mentality and easy to got hooked on the same path once again. However, I assume, illness will be cured, no one gets to the other side at once. And as for me, I feel I'm close to that cure. Not that me a year or several years ago. Hope you would find your cure, also."
none,"I assume this thing is not always popped up due to various reasons. People tell about stimulants, stimulant psychosis, caused by amphetamines, methamphetamine, etc, etc, cocaine. Though, why we didn't see, that caffeine, being a stimulant, can cause something similar to this? You know, the deeper I go into the caffeine habit — the deeper I see that problems only increase, especially something paranoid, something hallucinatory even in some stances. Also, after searching, I've found this: [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-06-21/high-caffeine-use-linked-to-psychotic-symptoms/2766144](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-06-21/high-caffeine-use-linked-to-psychotic-symptoms/2766144)And this: [https://redice.tv/news/caffeine-induced-psychosis](https://redice.tv/news/caffeine-induced-psychosis). You know, it may sound weird, though recently I've started seeing some agoraphobic tendencies. Yeah, a bit odd, that this thing I've never ever experienced in my life. Like the deeper I go about my caffeine addiction — the deeper the abysm of this pattern of behaving. However, even some things may sound dillusionary, I assume that the deepest fears were revealed to me. However, apart from knowing my deepest fears, I've attained weird anxious state, that I don't want to experience anymore. Especially with additive sleep deprivation and problems with sleep. So, tomorrow or the next few days I'll start quitting. Hope, I would regain my deep sleep and start to see vivid dreams once again. I hypothesize, that if I quit caffeine, my dreams would be brighter than it was prior to engaging into this caffeine habit. If it is so, it will only prove that all stimulants disrupts sleep patterns. I remember those sleeps after amphetamines and they were dull, shallow, on the surface. And if it is going to be true, I'd be happy, because I've been missing dreams recently. And, I assume the all work of studying caffeine is done. So, maybe I'll take all the pieces together later and make the retrospective of all of this. Something like that."
none,"I've been thinking recently, that there is some dilemma arisen in-between individuality and herd thinking matters. Firstly, let me show you that it is really hard to maintain balance between being an authentic individual and dissolvement into the common pawn of the herd, lacked of individuality. From the schoolyears we are supposed to go to schools, where there are teachers, whom we supposed to obey and listen to them. And here, comes the term herd thinking, which is started to be ingrained into our personality. As a students or pupils, we are bound with the society norm in schools, where there are certain rules we are supposed to follow. Let me also remind you, that during those early years of life 7-12 old, prior to puberty, a child is acting naive in some sense, trusting everyone and everything, a so-called ""tabula rasa"", where it is possible to write down everything you want into a child. And here starts the ""in-herd-ination process"", like to be transformed into the folk slave (there was an interesting song, also, on this topic, called ""Folkslave"", by Callisto [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH-V4NkEPz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH-V4NkEPz8)).  And during this stage, I assume it is really hard for a child to distinguish, what is right for him or wrong. For me, for instance, I started to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, even started to watch pornography during the schoolyears. Like I was attached to filth, only moving away me from my own authenticity, what I really wanted, what I really was — it was detached from me and I couldn't see my own thinking, what was really mine. I remember how it was hard for me to even be different at school, like most people listened to rap, hip-hop or other pop-music, I was a metalhead and I was like a rebel against everyone, I liked it, though I was mocked due to my interests in music. I had no point in wasting time for dumb conversations, etc, etc. And it was almost up to the end of school.And, when I started to go to university, I started to understand myself, looking for answers. Though, that herd pressure still was on me. Like that pressure was sown into myself, the seed of herd thinking was planted into me. I even acted the same way, as a typical normie. Like that wheel of ""go to school, go to university, get a job and have a family thing"" was planted into me. However, after the end of the university years, I started to recognize, that there was no even a room for myself. Like I was studied, did something, however it was like I did it for others, not for myself. And here comes the interesting part. I started to work, worked not for so long, and afterwards I started to recognize that something was going wrong in this world. Like everyone was (and is) a little mechanism in this system. For instance, the same old ""work 5 days per week, binge drinking on the end of Friday, detox from it on Saturday or drink once again and detox on Sunday"". And, it seems like people don't want to be alone, like they're afraid of something. And I quitted that job. I started really to detox myself from that ""herd thing"", started looking for answers. I'd say, that at the beginning of ""de-herd-ination process"" it was really hard, like I used to believe some information, like praying on some idols, like ""this knowledge only true, the others lie"" or something like that. It only depicts how this thing was really deep in myself (and, I assume, not only in me). Later, going further, embracing solitude, I started to find out, that not everyone is wrong or right, but the knowledge is in pieces — here and there, and sometimes it is mixed with some lie. And, here we come to the title of this topic. I started to find out, that the more you're in the herd — the more you farther from yourself. I tried to speak with my friend, who is really deep into psychology, though he a bit ""herded"", so to speak. And, later I started to see that my interests were going to be closer to the topic of psychology. Like, some piece of me started to change in the direction of psychology. I don't say that psychology is a bad thing or good either, I want to say, that everyone should find their own answers. He more relies upon ""integrating into the society"", that's why his main motto is based upon this. However, he forgot, that society can be a bit ""going the wrong way"" in some sense, and, hence there is no need to follow in everything that ""society says"". I assume, the main problem of the society, is that herd thinking suppresses individuality, a person become a bleak effigy, after the full-blown exposure to that herd influence. And here comes understanding, that there is a thin line between individuality and herd, between being authentic and between a herd person. And, from this point, I assume that all frustration of a modern man, especially NEETs and hikikomoris, are based upon inability to integrate, due to the herd thinking, which in some terms can be even harsh, because any difference from what is considered normal in the herd can be viewed as some ""deviancy"", ""oddity"", etc, etc. And here comes the next matter. We are programmed to be in the herd from the schoolyears, and probably even from the parents' influences. Remember how it is always stated in the society, that ""a human is a social animal"". Like here is some subliminal message towards those who are different. Like you ""should be social and an animal"". And here I can say, that social skills can be in handy to reach some goals and do something useful, though from the foundation of personal authenticity. Second, is it really a thing? If we were only animals, we would do the same thing, like animals do — instincts, procreation, acting like them. At the same time, I'd say that all animals are naked, though humans are not. So, even from the perspective that ""we aren't naked"" it only shows, that we're more than the mortal flesh. I assume, children are inhibited from finding their authenticity, their true nature, due to the herd influence and pressure from the authority figures, like teachers. Like the system teaches us to be obedient from the schoolyears, like act like this, do this, etc, etc. ""Say this"", ""you can't say that"", etc. However, situation may be better, if a teacher is a good person, with some wisdom, not with an urge to be in power. The main struggle is in finding oneself, one's own feelings, thoughts, etc, etc. And distinguish personal things from the ones, that don't even belong to the person. For instance, ""you should be rich, do this, buy that car"", etc, etc. But is it really important to live a successful life? I don't think so. For some, maybe. Not for all. That's why herd thinking in some sense even a poison to individuals, because this poison envenomes personality, individualistic traits, behavior, a bit detaching from what should be done from the person's perspective, not from the perspectives of the system we're living in. And here comes some rhetorical question: who invented this system? Ah, forgot to mention, even Plato said, that democracy is not the best regime. Even in Ancient Greek dictionary, ""demos"" means common people, like the power of the herd. Doesn't it remind you something? Like this thing has been going on from the olden times. Something like that."
none,"I know, it may sound kind of mad-scientist-ique. Does combining two different liquid with probiotics from the kombucha itself and sauerkraut can be mixed? Or they would just fight against each other? Why this idea has spawned in my mind, because I've thought about making a perfect drink with all probiotics. Also, I've been looking some information about lactic acid and some articles stated that there is no lactic acid in kombucha. Anyone did something like that?"
none,"You know, in the pasts I sometimes struggled with diving deep into the whole experience. However, why does it happen? Just common fear of not coming back? Is this it? I know, it may be sound a bit silly, though closed-eyed visuals, this approach is more deep diving. How to overcome this fear tendency? Because I know that I was not that deep, in the possible future I want to try it once more, but doing it right (as for deeper introspection, if it is possible to call so)."
none,"You know, I've mentioned that after ingesting of caffeine, for instance, coffee, I experience more chaotic thinking, which leads me to the further question: if my attention a bit ""wrecky"", why shouldn't I suppose that it can be a possible ADHD factor? Like ADHD is attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. After ingesting of caffeine I have some disruption of attention, like jumping from one topic onto the other. Second, hyperactivity — I tend to have problems with sitting on some topic and, thus, jumping onto the other. Hence, caffeine is a major contributor to ADHD, based only upon the chemistry and mechanism of action. I don't know, though caffeine seems to be not effective if used daily. It can be in handy in some times, like some kind of a recreational drug. Like, imagine how to work on the caffeine. My work tends to be disorganised, I even have troubles, occasionally, to watch some movie up to the end. So, for me, it has sense."
none,"I was sitting on the bench and reminded Gary Wilson's talk about ""The Great Porn Experiment"" and his other ones. And I remember how he once said, that anxiety can take the form of lustful urge, hence possible relapse can happen. At the same time, from my experiences, I remember how caffeine can increase horniness in anxious way. From neurobiological perspective, caffeine increases levels of adrenaline, which can be represented as anxiety, fear or something like that. And this fear/anxiety, fueled by caffeine almost always, can have its limits, because the end of any anxiety is some kind of a relief from this anxiety. And here, remembering that porn/masturbation habit gives some temporal relief, via endorphin release. Endorphins as long as artificial opioids, manufactured nowadays (and extracted from poppy somniferum) are considered as the most powerful anti-anxiety drugs. I can attest to this, because I used to partake in my former heroin habit. My point here is caffeine can be the reason why relapses are happening, because body wants to maintain inner homeostasis, i.e. to get rid of anxiety, tension in the body. Even the culture, which is based upon hypersexuality, has some metaphorical message — to get rid of anxiety and uncomfortability. Just to ease down.At the same time, the most popular drugs in our society are caffeine, nicotine and alcohol. I assume there are no coincidences here, because caffeine artificially increases anxiety (though, at the same time reveals our deepest fears) via adrenaline levels. Whereas nicotine — acts as a weak opioid (even on wikipedia there was statement about this) with some stimulant properties. I can say exactly, that nicotine relaxes a little bit and increases excretion of caffeine from the body (even there was article about how is it easy increase caffeine intake if a person smokes cigarettes). Third, alcohol can give also some relief from caffeine-caused anxiety, because alcohol acts via GABA, which places itself closer to benzodiazepines, barbiturates and other hypnotic drugs, the main effect of which — anti-anxiety, anti-insomnia. At the same time, I remind some scientific paper, where it was stated that caffeine in high doses affect GABA, in the negative way.So, from aforesaid, I want to say, that there are no contradictions here, because on the neurobiological level, it seems like body just tries to return back to its natural homeostasis with different methods — some use drugs, some indulge in physical activities, etc, etc. I can even hypothesize, that partially modern hypersexuality is caused by the anxiousness, caused by drugs (caffeine one of them), especially with prolonged usage. At the same time, not that healthy diet can be also a part of that. For instance, eating a lot of refined sugar only increases anxiety, which can be also a part of the possible relapse. I mean, this caffeinated anxiety can be just some kind of uncertainty of a person, which represents just an urge to get rid of this tension, that's it. And, I suppose, some crazy actions in life, caused by this anxiety, can lead a person in either healthy or unhealthy way, for instance, promiscuous sex can be really detrimental, especially knowing those STDs, that can be caught. At the same time, there are adrenaline junkies, who indulge in dangerous activities, just to get high. This high represents the same endorphin release, like getting rid of anxiety. I don't know, it seems like the whole society is based upon anxiety in differents forms, varying from place to place, from person to person. Something like that. Hope that, at least, was interesting. Peace!edit: also during sleep deprivation possibility to relapse can be increased, due to the increased levels of stress."
none,"I don't know, it's weird. I've made once up to 50 days, but now once again started the same cycle again. Like sensation is built up, urges are increased, hard to think about anything else, temptation to relapse. What the heck? What is missing here? You know, it may sound weird, however sometimes I feel the world is a bit of crazy, like too sexual around. And this intensity may frighten, at least me, sometimes. Occasionally I have a thought about the human possibilities can be enhanced and increased, but the mortal body with its biological programs a bit interfere with doing something else. I don't know, maybe I'm a bit sexophobic/commitment-phobic  or something, however I sometimes feel a bit weird, especially knowing that clues are everywhere. And sometimes I'm not even sure how the world supposed to be. Sometimes this reproductive urge makes me a bit crazy, this animalistic nature makes me a bit distracted of other things. And I found myself once again, relapsing, doing this stupid thing. This imperfect nature of a man makes me a bit despondent, like it distracts attention from something else. Like some element is missing right here, which can help me to get rid of this habit, but which one? And it is also weird, that I've never thought this way, prior to nofap journey. Like it was blissful ignorance, now it is painful sobriety, no other words can be found. Is the world is really too sexual or is it my delusion? I don't want to be such a brute, I want to be a man. I'm tired of seeing lots of things through the sexualized glass. I sometimes want to regain innocence, that was lost due to porn exposure. Like to feel once again when the grass was green and everything was good."
none,"First one: is it possible to make a new scoby, using only the liquid with bacteria and yeast? Hypothetically, it is possible, though not sure entirely.Second one: what happen with tannins from teas during fermentation? Do they transform into more suitable for ingestion form? I ask because if I brew, for instance, green tea, especially strong one, I'd have an urge to puke. At the same time, if I drink some kombucha based on green tea, I'd have no urges to puke. That's why I ask, why does it seem lighter on my stomach to drink kombucha, but not teas? Anyone studied this topic?"
none,"I used common scoby, 1 cup of sugar (\~250-300 ml cup), 10 tsps of cocoa powder. Up to 7-10 days of fermentation, it was a bit weird drink — neither cocoa, neither tea, something in-between. When it reached 14-18 days — it started to feel like some kind of kvass or something like that. Now, 21 day of fermentation and I can attest that it has something of alcohol nature. Weirdly, but my fermentation with black tea and the other one, with green tea, stayed almost for a month and it was fine, a bit bitter and sugary taste, though it is fine. With coffee it felt also good, pleasant drink. But with cocoa it seems like it has more alcohol in it, though there is no mold. Anyone tried to make kombucha on cocoa basis? Anyway, I'd hold it up to a month mark, maybe something would change."
none,"You know, I've been wandering recently, how much a person requires time to fully wake up without caffeine? Like, upon waking, I feel like my body is waking up slowly, however with caffeine a person forced to wake up. I assume, that body can even not like it to wake up so fast. The question is, how much time is required for the body to adjust to the cycle of wakefulness and sleep? Like forced waking up and slow waking up are different things. Who knows, maybe this slow process is essential, though with caffeine we can't this need to wake up slowly. I don't know, as for myself, just my thoughts."
none,"How can I get rid of sucrose, to get the pure ascorbic acid? What things should I do? I'm not fully chemist, though I tried once to get magnesium citrate from the common magnesium dioxide (as far as I remember, to cause diarrhea) with baking soda and citric acid."
none,"First, never had long-lasting jobs or something, only when it was necessary to have some money. Almost in my 30s, not virgin, had crushes, though dissappointing. I was lurking through this sub and it reminded me, all my thoughts that I was sure are present in our society. For instance, the majority jobs I tried, they were 5-2, almost 8-10 hours per day. And interestingly, I've found out that the more I worked — the less I had time for myself, due to tiredness, etc. So, partially, NEETs are good in a sense that free time can be used for educational purposes. For instance, when I started my life as NEET, I started to study neurobiology, substances, biochemistry of a human being. When I worked — I used to smoke a lot and drank lots of coffee throughout the day. Some jobs were terrible, due to the fact that bosses acted like they were the top of the world, like some kind of ""ubermensch attitude"" towards me. It was a bit weird as for me. I assume, capitalist society in some ways see their workers as needy persons, especially if one has a family, debts, etc, etc.Second, when I started NEET lifestyle, I've found out that there is something wrong in this world. Like work 5-2 or 2-2, no energy to do something else. The other thing I've found out, that the main mechanism of the capitalist system is based upon sexual provocation, almost everywhere — either common ads with ""sex sells messages"" up to the pornography. I assume, partially everything is surrounded by this matter, even making others feel like they have not something in their lives. I tried either sex or porn/masturbation and can say that it is somewhat a hard drug in some sense. And, I assume, this ""sexual blindness"", when overwhelmed by these urges and desire, can just hide something behind the curtains. Especially, knowing the rates of divorces and children left behind without proper parenting. Even if family is full, parents have to work a lot to get the best for their children, however children still are left alone, because 5-2 jobs, when there is no even strength to teach something to their children. Also, if capitalist society is driven by sexuality, especially in its lascivious forms, it is no wonder, that lots of issues are left behind this blindfolding provocation. Partially, NEET problem also is based on rebukes towards them, especially in sexual terms. I don't know, for me it seems that the powers that be know how to exploit human's nature, especially in degrading to over-stimulation of some needs. In the movies even, it is shown like ""everybody has this thing"".  However, not everything that can be sold leads to happiness. Third, NEET lifestyle can be useful in terms of introspection. You can delve into details, asking lots of questions, why society works this way, why should I go to army, why should date if my needs are not that intense, etc, etc. In some sense it reminds me creating an artificial inferiority complex, when someone doesn't meet the conditions, that make a person ""valid"" for this society. From the masculine perspective, I can verily attest, that I have no need in utter comfort, I need more meaningful purpose in life. Going back to jobs, I can say that jobs I tried haven't lead me to something inspiring at all. I just worked like a zombie, first time I foolishly spent a bit money on my girlfriend, for whom I didn't really care for, I just followed those things, that were accepted in the society, that's it. And only during ""NEET sessions"" I started asking myself different questions. In the school, univercity, I haven't been taughts about those matters. Even when I studied English in the univercity, they didn't give me the proper English at all, while speaking on reddit my English became better. I don't know, in some sense NEET lifestyle is an attempt to understand how the ""Matrix"" works and asking oneself, is there any need to partake in this ""Matrix game"". Most people go to work for almost a half a day, like some herd controlled by some shepherd. I, as a NEET, assume, that NEET, amongst depression, anxiety or other issues, struggle with purpose in life. Like in capitalist society shown some specific values, useful for the powers that be, the values that can be sold. In some sense, working throughout the day can be seen as selling oneself for some money. And, the harsh thing, that we're placed in such conditions, to survive, not to live. Wages, debts, etc, etc. And the values of the capitalist society don't mean that they are necessary for people, they are necessary for those who sell them and get money from them. Ergo, it may lead to unhappiness, because even from the fundamental principle that everyone is different and everyone has different needs, different values. Fourth, even if you NEET, don't be harsh to yourself, even if you're different from the society's norms. Find your authentic self. You have a great opportunity to find yourself and what you like. Detachment from the everyday chaos and lots of useless talk can be even good to you. Start asking questions, ask yourself what you really like. What your dreams, what you want to do. Even if those dreams are really unattainable, let them be. Without dreams it is hard to proceed in life. As for my opinion, I assume everyone should find their purposes in life, otherwise it is just modern-day slavery. Does everyone should work for 5-2? I assume, if someone really loves to do something like this, it is fine. However, I assume, this term wouldn't have spawned, if there would be no dissatisfaction with life. It only shows, that modern day jobs aren't suitable for everyone, I suppose those jobs are even forced upon us. For instance, I love languages, however in my country it is really hard to find a good job with languages, apart from the common interpreter who works in office for low wages. I like also neurochemistry, neurobiology. However, there are lots of jobs with other low-paid wages. By this I wanted to say, that if this issue exists, there is something wrong in this society, that's it. NEETs, hypothetically, can show what's going wrong in the society. Something like that."
none,"I wonder, if caffeine dehydrates body, so joints should also be... dehydrated. I mean, if my my hands become dry, hair become dry, experiencing dryness in my mouth, a bit dried eyes... why not suppose that the fluid between the joints can be also dehydrated? It is even possible to suppose that it also can play role in fragility of the bones. If it is so, caffeine is not healthy for the bones at all. Now I'm wandering the difference between bone strength on caffeine and off caffeine. What are your experiences on caffeine and off, speaking about the bone and joint health?"
none,"Recently I've read some story about drugs, and saw that cocaine gives ""egocentric state of mind"" or something like that. Now, I'm thinking, what is the most arrogant state of mind can create drugs? I remember how I used common amphetamine, though I hadn't been arrogant at all, I was more empathetic or something like that, especially among my family. On meth I was something like that, also, though more crazy, like doing stupid things, more euphoric and panicky, in the end, though. Also, I remember that term, ""coke rage"", which reminds me something egocentric, extremely even maybe. Caffeine gives me a bit anxious state of mind, that's why I can't think about arrogance, more about detachment or something like that. What's your opinion on this? Though, I assume that stimulants are more than the others fall into this ""arrogance-provoking substances"". I don't know, though cocaine seems to be more egocentric and less empathic, than other stimulants. Your thoughts on this? I'm just interested in what substances are enhancing ego. I've read that ""ego inflation"" thing on psychonautwiki, though I'm curious about practical experiences with drugs. I assume, that everything that boosts dopamine tremendously, tends to ""enhances"" ego itself."
none,"I've  been sitting on the kitchen and found out, that my hair always became  dried, due to the consumption of caffeine. I don't know, but I  hypothesize that caffeine, apart from the common dehydration, can  ""dehydrate the hair"". Yeah, it may sound a bit weird, however I think  there can be something in it, apart from the constant stress and  problems with hair. Hair on my beard also seem the same, when I drink  lots of caffeine. And hair from my beard falls off as the hair from my  head. I assume in some sense problems with hair can be attributed to  caffeine. Just sharing my thoughts, thanks for listening."
none,"You know, when I started all this journey, beginning from vegetarianism, I still struggled with understanding some theories, concepts, etc, etc. But when I started vegan lifestyle, everything started to take its place. Like all puzzles are taken their place of the whole picture. Like all theories prior to veganism had some controversies, but now, on veganism, all theories I have found and scrutinized, have taken their place. And this feeling of seeing clearly about things is immense. For me it's really an eye-opener. On vegetarianism I always struggled with some blurred perception, seeing perspectives quite besmirched, like mudded or something like that. Like cleansing of pointviews at whole. Thanks for veganism and this sub!"
none,"I remember how I was too social, had friends, etc, etc. And when I found out nofap. I knew I had problems, though I didn't thought I should try nofap. I thought I was mentally ill, with some OCD thoughts, anxiety, even hypochondria. Strangely, nofap showed me something new. Though, after going deeper, I started to lose friends, people, etc, etc. In some sense it was painful. Though, at the same time I started going closer to myself, what am I. I even think that fap life is ""sleep life"", like you do what others do, without asking everything. On nofap I started to ask myself and others about the nature of things. For me, nofap was and is something like a ""wake-up call"". Like everything prior to nofap was not entirely right, hence comes the necessity of turning into ashes, like phoenix dies, later to be born again. Like the olden ways are burnt through and no longer do anything useful, that's why comes the need to rejuvenate oneself. In some sense, I suppose, nofap is a spiritual journey, the tough one, though here comes one decision: going back or going further. First one is really easy, nothing should be done, like society showed how to reach success, etc, etc. The second one — what a person describes as success. To be a wolf or to be a part of the herd. Something like that."
none,"You know, like some information on caffeine I read with some scepsis, though off caffeine it seems like it is easy to delude myself. Like, for instance, on caffeine I know the cons of caffeine, though off caffeine it does the opposite, like mind can fool me about ""benefits of caffeine"". Like on caffeine I had problems with trust and off caffeine I do vice-versa, trusting lots of things. And it's a tricky thing, as for me. Like on caffeine my oxytocin levels decrease, while off caffeine they increase tremendously. It reminds me the state of mind on MDMA, where you can love the unlovable, metaphor for extreme trust. And I found out myself various times, diving into the same pattern of trusting off caffeine. Weird thing, suffice to say."
none,"Every time you relapse, try to do something new from the fresh start. Weirdly, but I saw how I myself, postponed the things that I should have done to be done later. I don't know, it may sound strange, but how the new streak you will start — the path you would follow. If you relapse and do nothing later, like ""I need to restore my semen reservoirs"", waiting for some miracle, you'd just do nothing. Nothing would happen if nothing is done. Also, I've found out that relapses happen when I forget my mission and what should be done. Relapse as it is, gives uncomfortable feelings of distress and this ""distress "" is the foundation of the further success. Sometimes painful events remind of what should be done, to change strategy. Sometimes, during my new streak, I saw how I was going in the wrong direction and relapse just showed me later to change my direction. And it's easy to fall into deception that ""everything's going fine and in the right direction"". Like you can be on nofap and watch lots of videos, that don't lead you anywhere. Something like that. Relapses, I assume, just reassuring in some sense whether is it the right direction or not. Relapse itself just shows, that something is going wrong, that's it."
none,"I think it is directly connected to this subreddit, especially to some who deal with drugs. I know, that it can be caused by ""trespassing the laws"", etc, etc. You know, in some sense I still have something like that. Some would agree with me, because I'm not only one in this thing. In some sense, it can be distressing to know that someone can have power over you (even not in drug sense). Like cops can carry weapons, but others cannot. Like there is no defence against cops, only if you act properly. And, I don't like even the idea, that cops can make a hint to the person about ""giving them money if you caught with drugs"". And in such situations it reminds me that Exploited's album, called ""Fuck the system"". It is not fair to feed someone with money, knowing that some drugs can be harmless, like weed. You know, I wish that some dude or dudess shit into the ziplock and cops found shit in this package, and that dude or dudess laugh extremely high, speaking ""ha-ha, you bastards, found your drugs? Muahahaha"". Btw, cool idea for prank. Though, it is disgusting to know that someone tells you how to act and what to do. Because I know stories how cops handcuffed people only because they had weed. I don't know, for me it looks like some people tend to play God in this world, though they're not Gods. Something like that."
none,"Previous post:[https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/ezqka3/my\_observation\_due\_to\_some\_circumstances\_caffeine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/ezqka3/my_observation_due_to_some_circumstances_caffeine/)I've been thinking today, that some relationships can resemble OCD, even there is some thing called ROCD, relationship obsessive compulsive disorder. I assume, some of them may be indeed OCD. Like, for instance, everyone was through some rough experiences with problems of sleep in the night, constantly thinking about someone, etc, etc. I assume, caffeine can play role in all of this. From the other perspective, knowing that caffeine causes extreme sexual impulses, responses, I assume there is some probabilty that this can be a part of a problem. Promiscuity, from another point, can be linked to this abundant sexual appetite. Pornography and masturbation can be directed to caffeine. Even from the point to get rid of tension, anxiety, sexual intercourse is some kind of relief from the toxicological point of view, because it is some kind of an opioid. Also, if to imagine that relationships are built on caffeinated way, we can see anxious/aggressive pattern, like based on ego itself only. Ancient Greeks also coined the term mania, which now can be interpreted as obsession. Like someone can give you something, like a person doesn't have this thing, that's why he or she asks another.From metaphysical perspective, lots of pleasures don't lead to happiness at all. I once used to partake in lots of promiscuity, pornography. It didn't lead me to somewhere useful for me. It only showed that there is something more, that fall out of my pointview. Also, intense sexuality, caused by caffeine (I'd say more ""anxious sexuality""), can mislead in some ways. Like, you can reveal yourself to people that don't deserve it, due to only sexual desire and need to ease that thirst. I even saw how those ""one night stands"" only lead to abhorrence in the next morning. Like, deep within a person knows, that he did the mistake, thought that pleasure tends to delude that person, that everything is okay. Like caffeine can inhibit knowing to whom it is necessary to show yourself and to whom is not. It is some kind of an artificial ""forbidden fruit"". And interesting the other thing, that ""night stands"" almost always tend to end only in revealing the body, nothing deep. At least, in my scenarios it ended this way. That's why, it is possible to assume, that some relationships are shallow, non-deep, families also can break, because there was only carnal pleasure, that linked both of them. It also reminds me stories about ""they quarreled too much and found relief only in the bed"". Reminds me the same cycle of ""relieving from the tension"", via sexual intercourse. I mean, that it is possible that if relationships are based upon caffeination, they tend to follow the same cycle over and over again, knowing the essence of caffeine with its ""fight-or-flight"" response stimuli. Something like that.edit: you know what's weird? For me it was easier to quit amphetamines, than caffeine. Recently, there was some post about 1905 or something, where it was stated that caffeine is a poison and highly addictive drug. You know, for me it looks it is truth, because it is really hard to quit caffeine."
none,"So, you know, I've been  studying caffeine for almost several years and now I'm coming to conclusion, that caffeine by its nature tunes in the person into the survival mode, aka limbic system activity. Imagine what survival is: like tendencies to find some safe sanctuary, constant anxiety/fear, intense sexual desire, which in terms of biological survival — just urgent need to pass down the genes. Also, limbic system is one of the oldest parts of the brain. In this sense, I can assume that caffeine increases more biological part of the human, i.e. his animalistic nature, weakening the higher self. Also, constant abiding in the survival mode is detrimental, because there is some need for relief. And, hence, it is possible to suggest, that all this anxiety, fear and anger with intense urge for procreation, all of this creates major frustration, especially in sexual sense. Anxiety and fear can be cemented in the body, depression rises up. No wonder, why modern society experience have lots of anxiety, OCD, etc, etc. Even problems with sexuality. At the same time, lots of sexual ads, extremely sexualized society. Hence, come other question: what was life prior to 21st century, even prior to 20st century? Were the problems the same, as in the modern society? It would be interesting to hear opinions of those who interest in history, etc, etc. Especially in ""caffeine history"". As far as I remember, caffeine in forms of coffees were popular in America and Europe, though in aristocratic circles. You know, at the same time I read some book about psychiatry by Kraft von Ebbing, ""Psychopathia Sexualis"" and, weirdly, but he had patients from aristocratic circles, who had problems with their sexuality. They resemble me their ""caffeine state"" of mind and tendencies to excessive (even bizarre) sexual pleasures, like people who indulge in pornography and masturbation. Teas, as far as I remember, were popular in the same sense. Tea is more of an English thing, because idioms like ""not my cup of tea"", like tea is ingrained in English culture. Also, I once read one encyclopedia from the end of 19th-beginning 20th century, and there was stated that ""tea houses"" are Japanese and Chinese slang name for the brothel. Also, I read stories about nowadays prostitution, that in some cases prostitutes can give their client a cup of tea or coffee. By all of this I wanted to say, that caffeinated state of mind may be profittable for the powers, that rule over us. Like, increased sexual stimuli after coffee (I even remember history of coffee documentary in France, UK, where was some pamphlet about ""coffee increases sexual desire""), increased fear/anxiety with some media effect, like constant intimidating in the media. Remember also how media say what is healthy and what is unhealthy — this season is healthy this, the next — they say the other thing. I wanted to add, that caffeine may be a problem, because it enhances reaction to some things, that should be dealt lightly. And this perception may be an agenda from the powers that be. Like constant fear, anxiety, aggression and horniness. And it's hard to see truth, when there are lots of anxiety, anger and horniness. I even write you this post, after relapse on pornography. I was intensely hornified and assume caffeine was a part of it. This also reminds me the conflict in the Catholic church in the Vatican, when the dark desires of their devotees were revealed. And, knowing that priests have to take vow of celebacy, I assume that they were just extremely caffeinated. I myself tried to abstain from any sexual activity for 50 days and, you know, with caffeine it's extremely hard. The last day I even had a feeling that my brain doesn't want to work in its proper way. I wanted to say, also, that extreme sexuality nowadays can be just a by-product of caffeine. For instance, women can dress up in extremely provocative way, which in psychological terms may be just some kind of verification that she is needed in sexual sense and invoke some ""erectile thoughts"" in men. At the same time, machoism can be just inferiority complex which is shown in the terms of hypermasculinity. Like caffeine sows the seeds of uncertainty in people, about their sexuality, themselves, their goals, etc, etc. From esoteric point of view, I can say that caffeine is predominantly works on the first three chakras. Survival is, essential, the sacral chakra. And if extremely caffeinated, sacred chakra is overactivated, which is shown in increased sexuality, obsessive thinking, etc, etc. The first three chakras are just ego programs, 1st one = survival, 2nd one = sexuality, 3rd one = power/strength, like ""ego seat"" or something like that. Even from those very sentences it is possible to say, that we're living in egotistical society without any higher goal, like ""bread and pleasures"".By aforewritten passages I wanted to say, that caffeine restricts a person to go deeply inside of him or her, mainly being in the state of constant alertness and uneasiness. This inhibits more profound and deep knowing of yourself, knowing only the ego side. Something like that."
none,"I couldn't stand that energy. This drive made me feeling overwhelmed. I tried to jog for some times, sports, etc, etc. It didn't work for me. I have no guilt about my relapse, though I'm curious about the lesson(s) I haven't learned. I don't know as for you, but for me life is a road of lessons, which are special for everyone. This streak was great, because I've found out that porn can cause OCD, even spoke with people who experienced HOCD. In my stance, why I relapsed — I woke up with intense horniness, which was hard to handle at all. Throughout the day my mind refused to work. I felt some hardness in my scrotum area. I don't know, how people practice semen retention for such long streaks. I have reached at least 50. I remember prior to this, on 20-25 days, I felt the same intense horniness, though manageable.You know, what's the saddest thing? Some fetish (tattoo, ethnic porn, like asians) triggers made me relapse. Though, I'm curious what behind those things. You know, I suppose that behind every fetish there is something. For instance, if someone likes rape porn, he can be a misogynist, which can be a problem in the family, in relations with mother or women detested that person. I know, that my fetishes hold me back, making me wonder, to ask myself how to overcome this issue. You know, at the same time, I wonder, why can't I partake in sex myself? It sounds silly to watch others copulating. At least, I have no guilt for what I've done. I think, I have to check what's behind that fetish. Any burden in life, as for me, is a lesson to be learned. I think, my fetish towards ethnic porn may be due to being outcast in some sense from the society, that's why I can possibly yearn for ""other home"". And it makes sense, if there are problems with relationships. I assume, sex tourism has something familiar with ethnic porn fetish, like ""no one interested in person from surroundings, so go to the other country to look for love"". I read lots of those stories in the past, lots of them are single moms. And you know, what's weird? I hardly ever recently watched something like that, like those ""horny thoughts"" evoked in myself and with extreme intensity. If it is the middle stage of this ""fap illness"", I assume the end is laying nigh. Problems just show what the thing should be solved, like the tip of the iceberg only shows visible part of the problem.Btw, how have you overcome this 50-90 days streak? What restricted you from going further? Any tips, hints? The only hint that comes into my mind, is to quit caffeine, that's it. Other things are done — no refined sugars, gluten, vegan diet, no junk food, no alcohol. Ah, also overeating still remains. Anyway, everything goes good, because I've found out what the next issue that should be solved ."
none,"You know, I'm feeling now like I'm entirely overwhelmed by this. Like it is really strong thing and it's hard to deal with it, it's like some kind of an immense ecstasy. Strong physical drive that is really hard to control. You know, I have a though that my body is just adjusting to this state of being. If it is so, it shall pass. Anyone experienced this overwhelming nofap tongues of fire (ha-ha)? I mean I'm feeling this now, though my logical thinking a bit disrupted by this natural drive. I'm a bit worried, though if it is temporary, I allow to be, why not. Though, I'm interested in hearing the stories of others, probably just to confirm that I'm not the only one who has experienced (or experiencing) this. Thanks."
none,"I've been experiencing since 30 days of my nofap journey, though don't know what to do with this anger. I do things, everything is going to be alright, etc, etc. Though, I occasionally experience anger in some situations. That's why I'm asking, what is the core of anger? What anger tells me about? Any successful stories about anger? What am I missing here?"
none,"I once googled throughout the Internet and saw rumours that some dude made psychoactive honey in France or something like that. At least it was stated so, though I'm interested: is there something like that in weedshops? I'm outside of America, that's why I'm interested whether this thing is on your market. I'm just curious."
none,"I've seen in the Internet that some dudes even did kombucha with weed, like cannabucha. What if is it possible to make something like that, but with psilocybin mushrooms? For me it sounds really cool. However, interesting to hear, maybe there are some ""mad scientists"" who made something like that?edit: like brewing tea with sugar, cooling down this liquid and later adding some mushrooms and scoby."
none,"Hi. When the triggers are going to lose their effect on the person? I feel like there are some triggers during detox procedure that can shutter nofap lifestyle, that's why I ask when I would be invulnerable to those triggers? How long will it take to see those triggers lost their strength? I mean some movies, even content can have some trigger effect, even watching some melodramatic moments in a movie can make a person aroused. I know, you'd say cold showers and do your things. Though, I'm interested in approximate time of weakening trigger effect. I just caught up by the trigger in some distress, though manageable. I know, that it is a long process, though I'm just curious. Thanks in advance!"
none,"Hi. I've been experiencing weird shit lately, like I experienced anxiety prior to sleep, even some kind of fear. And this thing is happening on nofap only. On fap there is nothing like that. Is this another flatline, that goes deep? You know this feeling reminded me my heroin withdrawal, where I experienced utmost anxiety without any possibility to get some sleep, like fear of something invisible. I don't know, sounds weird, I'm just eager to know. This thing has been happening since 2015, when I started my nofap journey. I have only one thought, that this is withdrawal, even more acute than heroin itself as for me. Any thoughts on this matter?"
none,"Hi. Sometimes I can easily get to sleep, sometimes can't. Sometimes weird things happen, like my room is not that cold, though, for instance, my monitor clicks or some weird noise, without any reason is happening. Sometimes I had even a feeling, that something is near me or even sitting on my leg. What the hell is this thing? I remember in my childhood I once tried to hide under my carpet in my bedroom, because there was something in my room (or at least it felts that way). And you know, since those times it has been hard for me to get good sleep. Though, when I used to binge on porn and masturbation throughout my 15s up to 25s — I didn't experience this weird thing. When I started to get rid of my porn addiction, I found out that those clicks are back. I remember times when I was reading in the kitchen and those clicks were there, though there was no changing and temperatures and the fridge never ""ticks"" itself, I rarely saw this. And the weird thing is that those clicks happen occasionally, more predominant in the night. You know, recently even lamp with turning on lights doesn't help, because even when I go to sleep in the day, daylight doesn't seem to help. What is this thing? Anyone experienced something like this? I once experienced something close to the sleep paralysis thing, once woke up frightened up. And you know, recently it's even hard to be in my room, like my room is colored in something dark, I don't know what is it. How can I be? What should I do? My sleep is broken and it's hard to proceed onwards in my life, knowing this thing happens."
none,"You know, I remember the day when I first visited my father's workplace when I was 15. And I remember vividly how those 15 kms looked like it was really far-far away, like the end of the world. During those times I was into fap habit, lazy, poor memory, hard to find the way to some destination, etc, etc. Later, when I started to be into nofap, I found out that I didn't fear any distance, because it's just time, nothing else. I worked as a courier in some company, when I first tried nofap in 2015. And you know what? I could easily find a way to the destination, like I could easily create a path to the destination without any need of a map. And I had no fear of any distance. While when I was 15, I felt like 15 kms were too far away, lol (on fap). Also, those times it was hard even for me to know the way to that place. I mean with nofap a man can do anything and have no fear of any distance — either physical or any else. To follow nofap is to accept oneself, accept that masculine fluid. I don't know as for you, but for me it's like accepting my masculinity. Like fap style is just getting rid of this thing, but nofap is vice-versa, accepting it (like that pic with accepting ""sexual energy"", colored in flame). No matter how is it hard, it shall pass eventually."
none,"You know, I vividly remember how I first tried to have some relationship with some girl in the past. All the occurence was a bit awkward, filled with anxiety. And you know what, when the day X came, I found out that I couldn't get to the intimate point. Like I was utterly anxious without any possibility to get to that ""laid point"". You know, if I hadn't indulged in this habit, I'd have had some relationship that time. Like those posts about erectile dysfunction, etc, etc. It's only about that, but also ""erectile mental dysfunction"", like you don't know what to do mentally. And you know, it was hard for me to say to anyone that I had some porn and masturbation problems, though it was a must. If putting myself onto the place of another, they'd see that a fap person acts a bit weird, though without any hint why is it happening. It's like some kind of a disaster for one and for another. Also weird how those habit brainfogged my entire being, my personality, where I was a weirdly horny and anxious addict. Something like that."
none,"Hi. Today I though a little bit about the things, how my fap lifestyle led me to different illusions about my life. I remember how I tried to date with some girls, later just finding that I had lots of misconceptions about women. Also, I remember how my mind fooled me about my problems, like ""you have no problems, man, they got problems"". You know, it sounded quite diabolic, like my ego tried to protect myself from the truth. I lied to myself, even said to myself that I was such a perfect person, that others didn't want to have business with me. With women I had the same, like my mind fooled me about them. Fap life tends to be only about getting laid, nothing more. I was deluded by this obsession, like couldn't see anything else, apart from it. You know, nofap in waves shows me all the shit things I've done throughout my life. And it's hard to accept everything, that was done. Like ego tries to fool me once again. To face the pain is inevitable, especially knowing that I was a major part of this pain. And now I don't want to play this ""holier-than-thou role"" anymore. Like someone came to me and smashed my glass with some golf stick. I wanted to say by the post that fap lifestyle is almost entirely some kind of self-delusion. I lived my life by lies principle, I even told women that I had lots of hookups, the same lie plays its tune. On nofap I tried to get rid of any lie and I felt some relief. Since then I follow no lie approach. Because I assume that if a person lies to himself, life changes in the same pattern, coloring life with lies. And it's hard to be honest with yourself, because some things are quite hard to accept, even if those things could be major fiascos of your life. I screwed lots of relationships due to fap and it's hard to accept those lost possibilities. However, show must go on. Cheers!"
none,"Hi. Weirdly as it sounds, though I've found out that all those fap years were clouded with being lost in my thoughts and some kind of detachment from the real world. Like I lived in some country, with some people, though those connection felt like were a bit ""foggy"". Like since those ""fap times"" I've been experiencing some disconnection with the real world. I don't know, how to describe it more vividly and accurate. Like there is some short ping with the real world in me. If you've played some games via online, like Starcraft or something, you'd get what I mean. Like I experienced something like slow reception of something's happening and occasionally it was like I was somewhat a bit detached from it. I assume that too much spending time on the computer with porn, masturbation and loads of videogames just disconnected me with the real world, making it hard for me to syncronize myself again with this world. I don't know how to describe it the other way. The only thing I wonder, whether I just like to dream, flying with thoughts in the clouds, or I'm just a bit nonchalant about the reality due to those aforementioned habits, that I used to have in the past. Anyone has something like this?"
none,"You know, I've found out that when I started nofap journey, I became bigger, my beard started to grow, my muscle mass increased. I assume that on off-nofap I was experiencing some development retardation, while on nofap I started to regain all the things that I supposed to have and supposed to be. I don't know, the last two or several years I marked that I grew up a little bit. Like I was something like 179 cm and now I'm a bit more taller. I feel now like I'm bigger, than I was and I'm happy about it. By this post I wanted to say, that you should not worry, everything you supposed to have you'll get on nofap. Eventually it would be this way. Just follow the nofap style and you'll get what you need, that's it."
none,"I wonder, does everyone come through this phase? I was utterly infuriated 10 minutes ago, like everything was pissing me off, I wanted to sow the seeds of destruction (lol). Any tips how to ease those symptoms? The only thing that come to my mind is to use some valerian or herbal tea."
none,"I've found out, that one of the reason why it is hard to be on the nofap road is to overcome that ""puer aeternus"" archetype. Like when you live with parents they can overwhelm a person with their believes, system, etc, etc. Especially if it is a mother. I assume, that nofap can be hard because the connection with mother (""devouring mother"" archetype). Remember that Oedipus myth? Metaphorically, it describes greatly a struggle for men to get away from safe home, where everything is good, you have food, safe place to be. Though, this seems to be safe, at the same time it is quite a detrimental thing, because, as for myself, I've found that my struggle with pornography was because my mother tended to overwhelm me with her presence (though she's unhappy with herself, like she tried to find her sense of life, doing the bad job for me and my development). Like she has fear about the thing that I'd be able to get away from her. Porn also played role in all of this, because porn is like a sugar cube, that sweetens unsweetened reality. And you know, what I also have found out? That my problems with relationship with women were based, because it was hard for me to accept that I ran away from those thoughts. And today I've found out the video, where it is described, how it is gruesome for a man to live with his parents. That's why porn and masturbation can ease those problems, that should be solved firsthand. So, **in some sense nofap is like a rite of passage for a modern man**. Sadly, but it's true. That's why I made this statement, because living alone, aside from parents is a must, because parents only can show their views, thus numbing the wants and wishes of their child. It's harsh to comprehend, though it is necessary for a patient to be cured. And aforementioned situation only my case, it can be a bit different in yours. I just share my story. I hope some day I'd share my success story and how I changed since this streak. Thanks for listening!"
none,"Hi. Recently I've been thinking why my past nofap trials were failed. During last years I tried to find out, why all of this had been happening, apart from running away from pain. Recently, I've found different on these topics, some of which were about different parent strategies to raise a child. One of them — was a total neglect, unemotional bond between parents and their child, where a child grew into something predominantly logical, rational, though with lack of some emotional intelligence. The other strategy, that was used is caring about the child with lots of attention to the child. And in the second example the child has grown into an empathic person, who can easily read others' emotions, their emotional states, more open to others. While in the first example person struggled with emotional intelligence, was more secluded and predominantly introverted. Partially, in my stance, my parents were fully into their jobs, doing what they could do the best for the child from material perspective. I was left alone, like parents didn't want to delve deep into my personality and understood what I was really needed. That's why I showed some examples, that I've seen recently in some videos. The other reason why I reminded this, because I had struggles with relationships, like I was looking for something in women, that I hadn't gotten in my childhood. Even when I was doing really good last several years, even sports, had interests, though something was missing. I don't know really for now, how to get the things I hadn't gotten in the past. Though, it is pleasure for me to come to this conclusion. From the other perspective, it's just a lesson for me how not to be a parent. Even those things happened long ago, I think I craved for parents love, that they couldn't give me in the past. That's why I still wondering, why is it hard to show such things, feelings, especially to the children, born to those parents? I can understand one-sinded falling love and how there is nothing wrong about it, because those things happen and it's fine. Why I reminded all of this in /nofap subreddit, because my addiction hid all of these matters. And it's tough to understand, how a child can be thrown, put into the hands of fate, without any warning that sometimes things happen good, sometime happen bad. I know, it may sound a bit sentimental, though I was predominantly rational person prior to starting nofap. I believed entirely in science, cruelty and harsh reality and ""emotions are weak"", etc, etc. Now I know, that both emotions, intelligence, logic and rationality are ingrained in the human being. Like the parts that can't be removed or surrogately replaced by something. Like a painkiller is a temporal relief, not the solution of the problem. My past drug abuse only shows this. That's why nofap is a discovery, journey through the knots of different situations and its outcomes, starting from childhood up to today. Like some mechanic in his workshop tries to understand, how everything works and how to fix all the problems, that inhibit or even stop the work of this mechanism. Now I know, that a human is a really perplexed mechanism, with its sophisticated features. Anyway, journey continues. I'd be entirely grateful, if my notes would lead me to the solution of my problems and some insights to somebody. Something like that for now."
none,"Hi. You know, I've been thinking, that prior to 2015 I'd been feeling like I was living not on full potential of myself. When I started to detox from porn and masturbation, all my fears started to intensify, I even left lots of friends, even the one who advised me to quit porn overall. And since those time I've started to seek myself. I once tried even to see what sex was, visiting prostitutes, because I wanted to know what sex was. I even tried with different ethnicities and you know, it didn't help, like it was interesting experiences, though I found out that this was not what I was looking for. It reminds me only ""la petite mort"", a-la little death — prior to this rise in dopamine/testosterone with some anxiety and later, experiencing some endorphin rush afterwards with prolactin rising. Biologically, in some ways it reminded me some cycle, even in the drugs' sense. I assume, that visiting prostitutes and one night stands are something similar, because the main of this activity is to get some relief. But relief from what? I assume, it's just sexual tension that I couldn't deal with. And here comes another question, what the sexual tension is? As for me, it looks like it's hard to withstand power of the sexual drive of some person. And in some ways it reminds me running away from my sexual drive, and it was, I presume.After understanding this, I found out that there is no slight distinction between porn/masturbation, one night stands and prostitutes, because those activities have something similar. As for me, seeing this by nowadays' eyes, it only distracts me from the things that I should do in my life. Later, through 2016 up to 2017, I started to change diet, seeing what I eat, tried to find some information, read books, etc, etc. In some ways I blamed others for my mistakes, had some misanthropic feelings and tendencies. I looked for some advice, some instruction what to do. And I made lots of mistakes, blindly following the others. I don't know, but when I started to practice ""brutal honesty"" to myself, expressing all my thoughts, feelings, that cloud of lies started to dissipate. Self-lies only contributed to my illusions, how to be and what have I to become. I hardly remember what was there, throughout 2016 up to 2018, I remember only how I passionately tried to find what I was. And pain still was there.To the end of 2018-beginning of 2019, I started to use drugs. I was dissappointed, without any idea where to go and what to do. I tried to use drugs to heal the pain, to anesthesize those harsh feelings. And it didn't help. During heroin withdrawal I felt like all my mistakes had shown to me, like some kind ""sins into your face"" feeling. Under ""sin"" I mean some kind of a mistake, that was done and those mistakes, that torture a person. Partially, it was my mistakes, partially it was some baggage from my negative experiences, that contributed to my state of being. Prior to nofap, I even had a weird relationship with some woman, though she didn't know that I was into porn, than into her. Though, she denied lots of her feelings and thoughts about me, I saw her eyes, like she cried a lot, maybe even screamed, who knows. Now, I feel some kind of struggle to weave the old me, the transitional me and today's me. It feels like the old me was something different from me, like not me at all. Transitional me was something like a pendulum, swinging back and forth — from arousal to depression, from excitement to sadness, from anhedonia to restlessness, reminding bipolar disorder. And you know, with a nofap vision, it's hard to integrate all the things, all the mistakes were done throughout all my last almost 20 years. And it's painful to accept lost opportunities, ill-gone activities, wasted years on some loathful, like porn and masturbation. I assume, I subconsciously abhorred myself to the extremeties, when I used to partake in this habit. It's like some kind of burden, that should be accepted in order to go forward.The only one question remains, how to integrate those three stages that I mentioned? Be it either rhetorical question or some kind of a advice. I don't know, maybe ego tries to take the person away from the pain one has experienced and it's logical in some way. Though, from the other perspective it may be a problem to accept everything that was done in order to go forward. I struggle with this for now, however I assume there is some way to integrate and accept everything that I went through. I promised myself not to come back and not only to myself, to that girl also. Because the old way is a dead-end with no movement onwards. Something like that."
none,"Hi. I've recently understood, that when in 2015 I had been already indulging in porn and masturbation for almost 10 years, I understood that this habit didn't work anymore. Like this coping mechanism was broken, and it just pointed to me that I was lingering on the past traumatic events, that should had been dealt with. You know, like porn and masturbation worked for 10 years, later eventually I'd come to conclusion, that those events of the past spawned up in my mind. Like you couldn't run away from it, deal with it. No matter how long a person tries to anesthesize oneself with this habit, traumas in different ways would emerge from the depth of the mind.I was once in the past physicically abused and mentally broken. I survived through my parents' divorce, naively believed some people, later finding that they betrayed me. Like an earthquake in the mind, where lots of believes were smashed, torn to pieces. Like I lost some part of myself long ago, due to those events. That summer of the past I felt quite forlorn, like some desolate island, far-far away from the continent. Like I was in the hands of fate, abandoned. I assume, that's why I found myself in some tricky situations with wrong people. I presume, that this desolation and led me to porn and masturbation. Like it kept my pain in secret. Like I couldn't show my pain to anyone, like you should be strong no matter how. I don't know, though today it seems to me weird, that people tend to be strong, like it's hard to accept that there is some weakness inside. Like some anxiety towards feeling weak overall. And rationally, if we were as human perfect, we wouldn't have come to such matters, I suppose. Though, we're not perfect. In the past I was said that I should be strong, ""don't cry"" or something. Though, several years ago I found out, that when I was overwhelmed of everything, crying only helped me to relieve, in some ways I ""silently screamed"", because it was utterly unbearable to handle. I assume, that porn and masturbation habit is just some kind of disappointment in life, like a person is left alone and this aloneness can be hidden behind this habit. And sooner or later, when porn and masturbation seem not to work at all, trauma will get back eventually. It's like a lesson to be learned, an experience to be shared. I even once wished to be a robot, not to feel at all, though it is not possible. I tried, I've failed. At the same time, if there would be no traumatic events, there would be no learning. How to understand what friendship is, if there would be no betrayal? How to understand what love is, if there would be no seduction, betrayal and disillusionment? I don't know, though, I assume, my writing can be helpful to someone. I don't know, why am I doing this, maybe it's just a circle of life, maybe I required help in the past, that I hadn't gotten. Maybe it's just my helping hand to some, who yearns for some light in this dark tunnel of their habits. In any case, there should be some belief that darkness is just a lack of light, darkness is temporal, no matter how it can be dark, even entirely. It reminded me the last mission from Warcraft 3, Reign of Chaos, when the night elves battle with demons, like battle for the World Tree. And nofap is a great battle, that shatters the earth, making earth weep and mourn. Though, wounds tend to lick in time. And every wound eventually shall be licked. Here it only depends on the matter, who wins — old pain, that grown into the mind or, if some gardener who would try to cleanse his lands out of these weeds, that only spoil the soil. Also, even the darkest night is temporal, sun eventually rises up soon. The darker the night — the closer the end. I assume, that's all that I wanted to say for now. Cheers!"
none,"You know, essentially, I've come to the thought, that there is no possibility to get fully into the ""nofap realm"", without embracing all the pain, that you've tried to cope with through indulging in pornography and masturbation. In my stance, I couldn't get wholly to nofap right away, because everything I should have re-lived and understood, why am I here, why I get back. I assume it is really hard to embrace all the pain and due to this, some tend to run away. Without understanding why you run away, a lesson is not learned, it just gets back up to the moment, when you scream ""Eureka!"". And after understanding the whole matter, you fully understand why you should get there. I started watching porn, because I had lots of pain after parents' divorce, some childhood trauma. And now I submit to myself that there is no my fault in all of this, I was a kid who was saddened by those events, that's it. Past can't be changed, though comprehending it is a right away from those events. Even there were bad events, I'm alive, that's the thing that matter. And I can forwardly carry on my journey, though I'm not sure what waits me tomorrow. Embrace the pain, embrace everything, there is no need to run away, because those cycles run in circles up to the moment of comprehending. That's it I wanted to say."
none,"Today, I woke up with some feeling of being lost, like I'm going in the right direction, though there is some lack of something, which I don't know what. I don't know, it's like no urges, just some kind of relaxation — just ok, no sorrows, no happiness, I don't know that feeling. But I assume, it can be called ""void"", temporal void. It's like you don't bother whether you do something or don't. Weird sensation. Like some kind of transitional state between the old me and the new me. Like I've come to some terra incognita, like Columbus did long long ago. Like I was on ""fap island"" and now I'm on ""nofap continent"". Sounds a bit ridiculously funny. Though, it is the way it is. The only thing I don't like in this stage, like some blurred vision of my goals, what I have to do. Like it is encased in ice for a while and I have to find some fire to melt that ice. Like there is something between this ""void"" and the next step forward. It's like examining the void and find what is lost in this void in order to go forward. I don't know, I just wanted to write all of this because I was a bit confused about this temporary lack of libido. Though, it passes eventually. Thanks for listening."
none,"Hi. You know, I remember when I was omnivore and vegetarian and I experienced some problems with my emotional states, especially anger and anxiety. When I switched on to the vegan diet, I started to see that my emotional intellect started to develop, like I started to experiencing deep and more profound emotional states, that were not available on my diets of the past. You know, it's like I've found a new puzzle, why veganism is a must to discover deeper layers of a human being. I've never felt that compassion and feelings of other people. Like my omnivore diet just showed me my worst sides and shallow emotions, while diving deeper, through vegetarianism, I've found that veganism is more than just ""don't eat animal flesh"" or something like that. It's just not for the body to feel good, it's more than that. It's a way of living and the way of acting. It's like love, though in more deep sense. Love to yourself, love to other beings, I assume empathy and sympathy arise from those modi operandi towards life. And veganism is a major step into the new world, so to speak. And I'm greatful that I've found myself here. Cheers to all of you! I'm glad to partake in all of this movement, at least on my local level, chaning my diet. Thanks!"
none,"I've found out that when I started to be extremely caffeinated, my teeth quality started to decline, like cavity and some bad odor from my mouth. Partially, it can be due to food that decompose in my mouth. Though, when I used to be low on caffeine, I hadn't got that issue. Does anyone experience better teeth after quitting caffeine? I know that black tea can cause teeth to blacken, same can be with coffee."
none,"Hi. Today I've started experiencing utter darkness, like I have fallen into the abyss, dark chasm, where everything started to look so hopeless with extreme despair. I assume, this is the flatline. When you feel like you descended into the underworld, where everything seems to be dark, vague in its color and shapes. When you don't want to indulge in this submissive habit and at the same time it is hard to take a leap of faith into the new direction. This is what pain feels like. All the pain I tried to run away, found me later in its profoundness. Like a Divine Comedy character, who descended into the hell of his own dark thoughts, lost hopes and where sinners burn for their running-aways from themselves. I may sound a bit theologic, though Christian mythos vividly described the mood of hopelessness. I don't want to conjure up in you some pity, I just want to describe the darkness of pain, from which we run, using pornography and masturbation as some kind of coping mechanism to our hopelessness. Though, even this darkness is a premonition to the further phoenix revival in a person. Especially knowing, that this pain has been cumulating throughout this pornography encounter. To see the light is to survive through the dark moments of life. I know that the end of this torture is laying nigh, so I continue onward this battle, Ragnarok, if it is possible to say so (ha-ha). Stay strong, stay tuned to yourself and you shall prevail. This battle only you can win. Embracing the darkness and passing through it will show that you can endure those trials of life.P.s.: funny, now is playing a cool tune. ""Power of the horde"" from Warcraft III soundtrack, quite amusing track, suffice to say."
none,"Hi. Today I've started reading all the notes I had been making for almost a half a year of my drug abuse. You know, reading all those notes, I've figured out that I tried to say to myself that all problems came from other people, though it was my personal projections and traumas, that came from the past. Reading all those notes, I see that I struggle with my sexuality, saying the things like sin, lust, etc, etc. Partially, there is some truth in those lines, though it is stated in a bit morbid way. With today's retrospective, I know that sexuality is a part of a human essence, you can't get away from it, though I tried to run away from it. No matter what I did, I couldn't get away from it. Like a deep psyche conflict, which started to resolve quite recently. To know thyself is to know your higher self and your animalistic self (my definitions), because we're both animals and something divine. During heroin withdrawals I cried tremendously, because I felt repentance towards those, whom I showed my worst attitude, though they didn't deserve this. I read the lines, where it was really harsh to understand, painful to know, that sometimes during those strong heroin highs I could lose my breathe, like the question, what if I never wake up after this high? Today, I also understand, that some coincidences were not like those at all. Like police stopped me and it looked like they wanted to get away my stuff, though on another level of understanding, I wouldn't know, if they would haven't come, where I would be. Like it was a ""stop-to-do-this"" call. I was struggling with my sexuality, lust and pornography problems, though the main cause of all this was just disobedience towards accepting myself, like I revolted against my own nature. From Jungian perspective, my sexuality turned into the shadow, the part of myself, that I didn't want to take in, to integrate in myself. I always craved from something outside, with the feeling that I could find it. Now I know, that everything I need is already in me. Heroin was just a thing, like a drug that inhibited my possibility to understand this. I remember, how I first ordered heroin. It was due to my relapse on pornography, my inability to resist those urges, like I was in the dead-end about this thing. Heroin only replaced my porn addiction for a while, though it got back. So, in my case pornography and heroin were similar, like they were interchangeable replacements. Though, the main root of my problem was an inability to accept myself, start to love myself. Now, I know that I'm capable of love and I can love myself. And I continue to reintergrate all of the parts of myself into my new-found being. Hope this story can be inspirational or just interesting to read. Thanks for your listening!edit: after reading this diary, I started experiencing some sadness, like being lost in life. Like there are lots of pain, that can be found in this diary. Though, it was a such good lesson to come to now. Without those experiences, I wouldn't be here. Anyway, everything is gonna be better, because the toughest things remain in the past. Like my father once said, ""the best things are yet to come"". Something like that."
none,"I mean occasionally there are thought loops, negative thinking on caffeine. Like feeling trapped in irrational fears. However, from the other perspective caffeine can show that you have fears, I found that I was raised in semi-puritanical way, making harder to understand wholly my sexuality. Also, I think caffeine can be used as need for energy thing. Possibly, from psychological perspective, a person is disconnected with his/her sexuality, making this person using drugs, in this case — stimulants, to make something look like sexual drive. I don't know, though it seems partly legit, as for me. You know, if sexuality is some kind of a fuel, like roots for the tree, feeling unrooted is like being disconnected from a person's nature. It's like a tree without root. Seems weird, right? I assume, also, that partially disconnection from the human sexuality was made by religion (I'm not against religion, they have good thoughts), like fear of yourself, fear of reproduction, etc, etc. Like religion is more to soul things, higher purpose, etc, etc. While psychology is like a bridge between soul and the body. I think caffeine as coping mechanism can be related to some sexual repression and dysfunction, like craving the drive to do things. I just was wandering, why is it hard to quit caffeine, and it's my hypothesis on this topic. You know it reminds me sometimes the things some people tend to repress, while revealing them during alcohol inebriation. When the person is caffeinated, it is possible that some part of the psyche of the person is disinhibited and some fears are intensified. I don't know, though I'm sure that fears can tell us something about ourselves — what we like to see in ourselves and what dislike. Sometimes we also project our fears onto others, though this projection is reflection of ourselves. Now, I'm curious, what we tend to compensate with caffeine binge or some other drug? You know, it's like when a person eat loads of sweets, the person is lack of love in some way. Binge eating also is some of inner symptom. That's why I started this topic. If someone wants to discuss — I'd like to speak, because I'm yearning for the truth. Like to understand the matter of this thing. Something like that."
none,"Today I remember how I was disoriented, when I abused those drugs. Like my perception of reality was quite distorted. I struggled with finding some place on the map, like I knew where it was, but it was to hard it. With heroin I felt incredibly good, though a bit fuzzy in reality. That's why I used speed, it corrected my state a little bit, though it was not enough. Used meth post-heroin quitting, though experienced weird things, like feeling euphoric rush to do weird activity and saw shadow people, cats that were not there. Weird things. I remember after quitting speed, I started feeling good again 3 months later. In July or August of the last year. Now I'm not sure I would use those drugs again. Like they did its job in the last year and now they're pointless. I suppose if I use some drug, it would be either pot or psychedelics. Even molly, I suppose, I wouldn't use, because I've found out what love is. Like molly showed me the state of love and now I'm incorporating it in my real life without any use of molly. Something like that. I'm free from amph/meth for 9 months, from heroin for several months (used it several times and got rid of it, like it is no longer necessary for me). Don't know whether it's just a success story or turning the page. But I'd assuredly say that without those experiences I wouldn't be here in my life (including activity on this subreddit). Thanks for listening!"
none,"You know, I'm reading now my old notes and see, that weed conjured up in my memory the things that happened in the days of yore. Like, memories that should be re-watched, to intergrate the things that I tried to get away from. Like weed inhibited my suppression mechanisms of psyche, making it easier to take necessary memories and to understand why I was the way I was. I don't know, weed helped me to come to understanding of my traumas, phobias, etc, etc. Weed also was a good thing for my introspection, like philosophical thinking, etc, etc. I'm speaking here about sativa strains, because I smoked there sativas. Weed also helped me to answer on some of my existential questions. Something like that, saying this in the restrospective sense (last time I smoked those strains in February 2019). Thanks for listening!"
none,"Hi. Weirdly to say, however I suppose during all my fap years most people tend to decide what to do for me. Like, fap is a road to constant submission to life, like going throughout easy way. Like eat your sugar cube, relax, eat your sugar cube and again relax. I mean, under fap problem lies something is called procrastination, fear of going further, etc, etc. Recently I've even said ""I love you"" to some girl, that I've never spoken of. Like I've done such an act and feel good, just from the knowing that it's the right process. I mean there is nothing to lose even to say something like that, because you know that you're capable of feeling this. And capable of such a human emotion. On fap I even knew that I felt lust, exclusively. And you know, it's hard to re-intergrate into the society with a new-found power, called nofap. You know, at the same time I'm a bit in a catch-22 situation, because I practice semen retention and there is some girl out there. And at the same time I'm not entirely ready for a relationship. Though, nofap helped me to risk a little bit, to show something new to myself. I think people tend to relapse, because fap life is easy life. Like that sugar cube description. And the harsh thing is it is a bit tough to re-integrate. I'm a bit anxious about those things. Like some kind of a post-poned learning of things, though it happened at last. The other thing of a nofap journey is to take responsibility for your life. And the last one is the hardest one. Like a ""do or die"" situation. At the same time, this seduction and my goals a bit in a messed up situation. During this nofap streak all my emotions and everything I've been feeling for the last 10 years like poured onto that girl. I don't know, I've never been that honest. Even if it made me vulnerable, there is a feeling that I've freed myself from my emotional buggage and holding off that there was no even need to hide. Like ""emotions are weak things"", etc, etc. Like on nofap I started to disintergration from the society norms and now with some scepticism to some norms, there is some need to find what is necessary to rely on for myself. In such a moment I wander that life is at the same time an easy journey and complex one, because some things are easy, some are not. And the most hard thing is to find oneself in this world, because there should be some thing that should do. And at the same moment a woman can be a great reward, like a helping hand. Even though it is hard for me to intergrate both things, it shall be integrated and found the way to do so. I think some men also struggle these things, because if porn and fap were just a tiny little problem, there would be no such suffering and pain and troubles to overcome those things. Something like that."
none,"I wonder, if caffeine changes pH of the body, which leads to releasing calcium, magnesium to change pH back to normal, so quitting caffeine should help with bone fractures and other weak bones things. Also, testosterone should stabilize also. I just want to know, has anyone marked any changes in bones strength after quitting caffeine? Logically, quitting caffeine has to help with this matter, though I'm still hesitant for this brave move. It would be interesting if some athlete or runner gives some review on this, because they're closer to sports. However, any opinion would be interesting to hear."
none,"You know, looking back what was happening throughout almost 15 years of my life, I've found out that porn just obliterated my life. You know it's quite sad to come to this conclusion, especially knowing that all your best years of younghood are almost gone. Now I'm almost in my 30s and it deeply makes me sad, that others started their own paths and archieved some success. I once fell in love with some girl and I hurt her badly. And it was due to my inner fears, inner demons, etc, etc. And also porn. I feel like that porn makes me infantile, like I'm almost in 30s and in some things I'm not even mature. Throughout some time I even lost my meaning in life. I typed to the girl, I fell in love in the past and asked her to help me to get through all my things, because I've lost people throughout all my nofap journey. Don't know, but for me solitude with nofap showed me my darkest sides, even the bad things I did in my life. Porn is detrimental due to the single fact, that you become a total loser. Now I'm shy due to this, because it is hard to comprehend the fact, that I'm starting with some waiting. And I'm anxious to tell those things even to that girl. It's like to take the side of a weak man and to show what is inside of me. And you know what? When I spoke with her — I forget about porn at all. The only thing I wonder, how can she still speak with me, after all the shit I'd done to her. And you know, I feel like my emotional sphere is also a bit shattered, like I learn how to be, to love once again. Like indulging in watching porn numbed my emotional well-being. And you know it's a horrible thing for either a man or a woman to be with the man, who is into porn. I assume, if I hadn't been watching porn at all — I would be with her, probably. She was happy there in the past, even she wanted to help me, now I'm not sure how she looks at me at all. In my stance, my watching porn made a terrible damage to a woman. I mean porn damages all the men and the women. Instead of going into the great future, some indulge in porn and both sexes feel hurt. Sometimes I feel strong repentance to the people I hurt, especially to those, whose hearts were broken by me. The main detrimental thing that does porn — it takes away your happiness, your goals, your future. Like you feel lost in this world and don't understand what to do. And it's quite a sad reminiscence of the lost days due to porn. I hope you all quit this habit, because this pain is unbearable. You fool yourself, extremely harshly. Quit it before it's too late. Feeling this pain in 20s is weaker, than in 30s, when there is a feeling that a half of life almost gone. I believe in you, nofap brothers and sisters. I wish you'd be free from this habit. Thanks for listening!"
none,"Anyone messured testosterone levels? Science studies are the one thing and checking it — the other one. I assume some would have done that already, though I'm not sure. If someone did this, please tell me, I'm curious, because I have some theory about this. Maybe, problem with sexuality or something like that. I assume low testosterone level may cause anxiety, due to hormonal imbalances. Especially knowing that lots of people are chronically deprived and extremely caffeinated. I wanted to say that extreme fear can lead to some illusions. I always thought that dopamine, serotonin, etc are the main things, though hormones also play its role. Something like that."
none,"First, started experiencing more clarity, easiness. Physical activities are more prolonged: when I was vegetarian, I occasionally experienced some problem with legs, like they were hardened with the feeling like there was some tension in my veins (with omnivore diet I did lots of breaks, because of some pain in the legs). Second, I started to experiencing more profound emotional state — when I was a meat-eater I was extremely anxious and aggressive, on vegetarianism I was less, though also there was something... I don't know how to describe this, like bad qualities of me started to subside, though they remained. On veganism I started to more deeply self-explore myself, while on vegetarianism I was unconscious of myself. I don't know why, though veganism works in my situation to take everything bad in myself to surface, like to deal with these issues. Like I was an extreme glutton, when I was a vegetarian, especially binging on pizzas. I even couldn't handle with my emotions and responsed occasionally with utmost fury. Partially, I was pissed off on my self, though, from the other perspective I couldn't have understood this without turning my life into the veganism approach. Like food started changing how I perceive the world, how I handle with myself (especially trying to be absolutely true to myself, getting rid of any lies in myself). On vegetarianism and omnivorism I was more like fooling myself, falling into deception quite easily and blaming others for my problems. On veganism my eyes started to open wide. I wouldn't have understood this without changing of my diet. Like in the past I ate such heavy foods to just fill up my emptiness inside. Veganism is one of the eye-openers for me, as long as dealing with pornography issues, thanks to nofap subreddit. Don't know why, but I have a feeling, that when I binged on animal products — I showed only bad qualities of myself, though I'm not so bad at all. Like I consumed animals' pain, harming myself with negative energy (I don't know how to describe this other way). For me veganism is like lending a helping hand to the environment and some kind of ascetic practice to understand myself, because without it I wouldn't have understood this. Sadly, in the past I was a furious omnivore, who mocked vegetarians and vegans. Though, today I've understood that I was wrong. I should have turned to vegetarianism almost 15 years ago. And some beautiful girl tried to help me to get there, though I was utterly resistant to it. She was right. Who knows, how my life would have changed, if I turned vegan earlier. Perhaps, I would have faced all my problems — both physical, mental and psychological — a bit earlier, spending more time on useful things. My point is the earlier you turn to veganism — the faster you get rid of your life problems. Veganism showed me my life problems. It's like a key to the door, where the key is veganism. Thanks for listening, God bless!"
none,"I've been thinking, is there any benefit in using other balms, apart from the well-known lemon balm? I've read something, that orange balm has something in it, like tryptamine derivative. It was in the thread about some dude ""getting high on oranges"". If lemon balm has something beneficial, why not supposing that others balms can be in handy?"
none,"You know, before starting nofap I was not so aggressive or jerkish at all. But on nofap I started to see the other thing. Like I can get pissed off in some occasions, pretty hard. When I was on omnivore diet, I was a total asshole, like I could get pissed off pretty easy, like rage could overwhelm me those times of the past, it was in 2016. While I started to monitor what I ate — some problems got away. And on veganism I started to feel like myself, rage almost nonexistent, like it flows into more useful directions, while in the past I used to easily be pissed off. Also, for now I've found out that I have some philophobic tendencies, the thing I'd never understand if I was off nofap. Like it was unconscious in some way and porn, probably, was a detachment from my problem, not solving it. I don't know, but nofap seems to release all the things one is running from. For me porn/fap are like drinking alcohol, slowly diving up to the bottom of the bottle. My hypothesis is that the longer you're into porn things — the longer you detox from them, I have no other explanation. Probably, that's why it is hard and so long to quit in some cases. Traumas, problems and other crap are stored in and when you see it by your de-pornified eyes you can feel some anxiety and fear. Also, access to some things is granted by doing some work. Honestly, I still don't know what skeletons in my closet are hidden. Since 2015-2016 I've been opening new things to myself. I can assuredly say, that nofap is indeed a transformation, even light pace is better than nothing."
none,"So, this is my little contribution to this sub. I've seen that somebody used 50-100 mg, max, not more. I've read about max dose per day, which is 300 mg, so I thought 1/2 of this dose wouldn't make bad. So, probably 30 mins-1 hour onset, I'm feeling now calm, a bit ""calmly irritable"". I know, it sounds a bit weird or it may do so. I don't know, a bit weird mood — neither needing to sleep, or fully awake, something in-between. I can say that I care less what is happening now outside, like a bit sleepy, bothering thoughts of anxiety is gone, like they are weakened and have no power over me. You know, even this benzo is considered weak one, I'd say it's better to have something, than to have nothing at all. Also, I'd say it's cool to walk through the streets under tofisopam, especially knowing it's snowing outside. I don't know, looked like I was a bit in a dreamland or so, when I was outside."
none,"You know, from the first glance it looks like in the 21st century we're drinking lots of coffee and teas, that's why some people can be night owls. Though, at the same time, I'm not sure. I've been waking up in the morning recently, though I'm not sure this is my favourite time to wake up and I prefer to sleep more. Though, when I stay awake up to midnight, I feel a bit different. I'm asking the question in the title, because I'm not sure, whether it is good for me to wake up in the morning, because sometimes, when I wake up early, it feels like doing things are feels like a bit hesitant from my side and I'm not even eager to do them. Also, insights, occasionally come more often in the night. Someone experienced something like me?"
none,"Anyone experienced something like if you see some picture and you see some lustful content, though there is no such a content at all, only the feeling that eyes have fooled you? The same thing I saw when I read something, not often, though it can happen. Is PMO is the only cause of this or there is something in psyche, that should be studied? Anyone overcame this?"
none,"Highlights from this article are this:  ""**Nicotine somehow doubles the rate by which the body depletes caffeine.   What's that mean?  It means that if we were drinking two cups of coffee  while using nicotine, once nicotine use ends, that the stimulant effect  of those two cups might now feel like four.**""Article:[https://whyquit.com/FFN/06d-blood-caffeine-level-doubles-after-ending-nicotine-use.html](https://whyquit.com/FFN/06d-blood-caffeine-level-doubles-after-ending-nicotine-use.html)You know, remembering those big bugs of caffeine with tons of caffeine and how office workers like those mugs with additional cigarette hit, it makes me wonder, that they pay lots of money — both for these bugs of coffee and cigarettes. Like some kind of a perfect hidden business. Also, yesterday I relapsed on cigarettes and I suppose that this article is true, because I've checked it myself. Interesting, that it is not visible, like caffeine high is hidden behind the cigarette's one. Also, I saw some article on pubmed, where it was stated that caffeine elimination is fastened, than without any nicotine content. By my post I wanted to say, that some people know their high caffeine consumption, some don't, for instance, due to additional habits like smoking cigarettes. Hope this was interesting.edit: as for me, there is some kind of a ""triple-way"" addiction, on which works our modern age world. Like a caffeine-nicotine-alcohol relationship: boosting with caffeine in the morning, smoking a cigarette while going to work — this cycle is going on throughout the day. On the weekend there is some alcohol or some uses alcohol after the work just to ease down a little bit in order to get some sleep and relax from stress (some use sleep meds or something). And repeat. Like that movie ""Groundhog Day""."
none,"Relapsed on cigarettes due to being sad. Though, I've found out a weird thing. If I consume caffeine throughout the day, I will occasionally wake up during my sleep. Yesterday I smoked cigarettes, though during nighttime I didn't even wake up. Is it only due to nicotine's speeding up elimiation of caffeine alone or there is something more behind the curtain? You know also the weird thing that I've tried dosing of peppermint and valerian (from 1 g up to 5 g of dried extract) and it only helped to experience only more vivid dreams, though I occasionally woke up during my sleeptime. And it's weird, especially knowing that these herbs are sedatives, though cigarettes with their nicotine are a bit mixed thing. What am I missing here? Any thoughts?"
none,"I've found out, that sometimes caffeine creates something impulsive, in hornified colours, up to the point it's hard to resist the urge. I don't know, sometimes even conversations seem to be a bit awkward due to this. Has anyone experienced something like this? Has your perception changed, since quitting? If it is caffeine, I'd probably quit, because I don't want to turn into some kind of a savage beast. Funny thing, that I told others to quit caffeine and benefits of quitting, though myself act like a coward to quit it at last. Hard to quit, like pornography or something like that. Is your horniness more controlled, than was on caffeine?"
none,"It was heaven, now something in-between. You know, the most vivid and remarkable things that I can see now is that after relapse I experience some weakening of what I had understood throughout those 86 days. Like I experienced lots of emotional things — either happiness or sadness, even cried a little bit. Read and understood things. It was pre-relapse. In post-relapse phase I see, that all that I had been experiencing throughout that journey now seems to be a bit bleak, like I know what I experienced, though it looks like a bit distant. Like there was a bright picture, that turned into grey colors, black and white. It's like imagine some noir film with dark atmosphere with some melancholy, flowing in its air about the days of yore and unknowing what is going on further. Or it's like a dark dim with the foggy, humid weather in the morning with noir atmosphere. It's like some nostalgia about what it was, flowing in the air. It reminds me also Ulver's album, ""Shadows of The Sun"" — melancholic, dark jazzy, like you want to cry due to thing what you've done, though you can't. I don't know, though it seems relapse dumbs even emotionally. I may sound a bit sentimental, though relapse is losing of what you'd archieved throughout all the nofap stage. It's like you'd been gaining your nofap personality and later stopped its progressing. Something like that, just wanted to reassure to go on further, not fall into deception. Lust takes lots of faces, even the bright ones, though the outcome is the same, it is pain, it is crime against yourself, it is losing the highs of your ""started-to-be-built archievements"". I'd say also, that it is the thing you should do to love yourself."
none,"After yesterday relapse I started feeling horrible. I made post yesterday with my observation, though today I have a different matter. How to restore myself after this relapse? I mean, today I feel like I was banished from the heaven to feel the discomfort and sadness. La petite mort. Though that ""mort"" is not ""petite"", but ""grand"". I've heard that more fat could help, probably read some article about brahmacharya in the past. Also, I do my best to eat more dates, they're incredibly sweet, like a perfect fruit for me. Almonds and other nuts, sunflower seeds, olive oil (for balance omega 3 and 6; I tried to eat a lot of omega 6 and it was a bit hard on my heart, so don't recommend). Used to eat coconuts in the past, probably got some soon. Ah, also eat parsley, dill and other tasty salad things. Something like that. What's your recipe for restoration? What do you eat/use? I know, I may sound a bit ""wanna-know-how-to-fix-it-fast"", because I don't like this descent from that pleasurable state — feeling sluggishness, a bit weak-mind-ness, lazy to do anything, hard to concentrate, partial memory problem, etc, etc. You know, even if life turns to shit, everything is bad, it's terrible to lose your seed, it only makes problem worse, that it was before. Even shitty situation with seed is better that the shitty situation without one's seed. I'm quite sure now, that all power is in seed. Creativity, uniqueness, secret talents, understanding of yourself and nature. Everything's there. I don't want to sound apologetical (from apologetics), I just share my view on this. Because this suffering is harsh, like a stupid suffering, feeble suffering. I don't want you to suffer like that. Something like that."
none,"I don't know, though it seems like caffeine holds the energy on the root chakra or something like that. Am I right? I don't know entirely sure, though it seems like aggressiveness and anxiety are interconnected with the root chakra. I'm asking, because I practice nofap and it seems like caffeine with abstinence are just hold energy predominantly on the root chakra. Or am I mistaken? Anyway, if some answers it would be great, at least hint in where am I wrong.edit: looks like it's true [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gf7cI-g86g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gf7cI-g86g)."
none,"First, I'd say that I experienced weak response to porn. I've fallen into deception and was aroused with just a kissing thing. And, afterwards, I just got blue balls, the thing is hard to handle with. The main question I asked myself was, ""am I a bit weird, or society started to be something... too sensual and lustful?"". This question still bothers me, because this thing is like everywhere. I don't know, maybe these things were out of reach for me when I was PMOing or just this some kind of post-poned sexual maturation and development. Also, what do you think about this? Sometimes I even didn't know, what to do about that. Sadly to see that lots of people have/had problems with porn and the main information comes from this subreddit, not parents who should prepare children for such things. I say it, because no one spoke about some dark things in our lives. For me, nofap and battle with porn are like a conflict between spirit and flesh. Like something imperfect in its nature. It's like making a choice, what you will be more — human or animal or something. Sometimes I even have doubts about my journey, because pain is hard. Throughout my journey, I have lowered my anxiety levels, though it is still present. I have problems with money, jobs, etc, because this anxiety just holds me in my home. And honestly, on nofap I have less desire to communicate (which can be my anxiety or extreme introversion). By this I want to say, that nofap can show just your problems, or layer of them. It's not a cure-all, but a good start on searching of this cure. Sometimes it's sad, that people tell me that I have a bright mind, though that crippling anxiety and fear hold me back. Nofap showed me that I have something inside. Nofap acts different on everyone, some have less problems, some more. I suppose that some porn tastes can indicate problems in some direction, like if you like aggression — you're probably aggressive, something like a mirror. Though, after this streak, I've reached 100 days without refined sugars, almost 3 months on vegan diet, quitted coffee. At least those changes were worth chasing on. Still, it looks for me weird... like I wasn't prepared for this journey, even for life. No one taught me some kind of classes on human interaction, because after nofap it seems like it was on a weird level. I don't know, but I have a feeling that these things are just layers of my old grieves and offenses. Sometimes, on the nofap journey I experienced that life more of a mystery, than just ""typical reality"". And really now I'm just between biological reality per se and spiritual realm, swinging between two of them. I don't it's both simple and hard at the same time. Anyway,tl;dr: nofap is a journey inside with reaching your own problems, layers of problems, grieves, offenses, etc, etc. ""Reloading"" yourself. Stay strong and do not get to ""blue balling stage"", because it cloudes your mind, make you tired and make you more possible to relapse. Thanks.edit: also it dumbs you, making simpler in the bad way, like, for instance, you have a good vocabulary and on relapsing you become retarded for some time, like weakening of ""the high system"" of the man, i.e. intellect, thinking, etc, exchanging on the strongest carnal high, it's high nevertheless.edit 2: also, anyone knows how to deal with aggression and express it the right way? Jogging, doing exercises are not enough. Sometimes it's even hard to stand this cumulative energy."
none,"I used to eat some spicey food like chili pepper (probably due to capsaicin in them), worked really good. Also, less the dosage of caffeine — weaker the crash. The more you drink — the harsher the comedown."
none,"Don't know about you, but I've seen times, when I did mistakes while under the influence of caffeine. Last time it was when I tried to make a salad — I mistook a sprig of dill or parsley, putting it in the salad, instead of taking it into the blender to make smoothie later. I don't know whether misreading also is connected to this, though I can attest that occasionally reading on caffeine seems to be ""lazy"", maybe it can contribute to modern laziness to read, even articles in the Internet, and shallow-mindness. Also, I remember that some news were paying attention to car accidents, which happened after a cup of joe. Probably, accuracy ""suffers"" and, possibly, attention. If it is so, quitting caffeine can help you get rid of unnecessary mistakes, which can be a benefit. Something like that."
none,"Due to the fact that caffeine makes your sleep worse, your sleep and restorative function also becomes worse. Also, REM phase of sleep is essential, though caffeine shortens it. Here the notes:[https://podcastnotes.org/2018/04/29/why-we-sleep/](https://podcastnotes.org/2018/04/29/why-we-sleep/)Caffeine drinks are like some refined sugar food, like you get the energy and in short-term you succeed, though lose at long-term direction and long-term goals. So, quitting caffeine is just changing priorities from short-term to long-term. And I know and understand you, why it's hard, because modern age society is just running on ""fast pleasures"", like get it now, can't wait. Feeling urge — go and take. Gambling also works the same. I don't know, thought it seems that this conclusion leads to just accepting the fact that we're uncoscious drug addicts, who yearn for fast results. No wonder, we're living in the consumerism world. Entrapped, encaged in this vicious cycle of ""urge-take-feel pleasures"".Edit: another link about sleep and why it's important.https://www.sciencealert.com/chemical-messengers-how-hormones-help-us-sleep"
none,"Recently I've found another possible lifehack to reduce caffeine consumption. I remember how I used teabags, putting them in my big cup immediately, making caffeine amounts too high to the end of a day. I took 2 bags and put them into small teapot with approximately 500 ml water in it, used a small cup \~100-125 ml. Later, I drank 4 cups of tea with my small cup 125x4=500 ml — amount of brewed tea in my small teapot. To the end of the day I drank 2 times, using this teapot. I don't know, I tricked myself with prolonged ""tea-party"", in the same manner as Chinese people use piyalas, enjoying their teas. I drank more small cups, enjoying its taste, without any hurry, and less caffeine content was consumed to the end of the day. Before this method, I used to take a teabag or two (occasionally, had some dried leaves) into my cup, drinking almost 5-6 cups throughout the day. If there were used 2 teabags per cup, amount of caffeine consumed throughout the day would be pretty decent. With this teapot I decreased my caffeine amount almost twice, though drank more cups. I don't know, this method resembles some kind of an entry-level tea ceremony or something like that. Hope this, at least, would be interesting."
none,"Don't know, maybe it sounds a bit weird, but caffeine releases adrenaline, which makes you agitated and stressful. What if caffeine is just a fast high, like refined sugars? With extreme sports there is some danger, like for health, with its cool euphoria later. Caffeine is making you feel this way immediately. And this ""adrenaline euphoria"" can be felt, when the danger is gone. If you've ever tried to ride on bike extremely — you'd get what I mean. Caffeine prior to running, for instance, gives the same euphoric rush upon the ending of running. Sorry, my words are a bit fuzzy, there was no caffeine today. I wanted to say that caffeine gives you adrenaline state, which resembles the state, which adrenaline junkies try to attain. It can be also a part of problem to quit caffeine easily. It may sound odd, though it sounds like an ""adrenaline addiction""."
none,"I'm curious about potentiation of valerian with peppermint. Anyone tried this? Technically, it should, because both are sedatives. Though, interesting to hear if someone has tried this."
none,"Probably this question is more of /drugs subreddit, still I wonder, if caffeine works by increasing adrenaline, beta-blockers like propranolol should ease up the sensation of anxiety. Anyone tried that? Just out of curiousity and ""for science"". If anyone tried, it would be interesting to hear about such experiences."

none,"I know, it may sound weird and it is, still there is something between ""fap life"" and neuroleptics. I mean,  after every such a dirty action there is some rise in prolactin, which also happens in those who take neuroleptics. The point is that fap life is something zombified like life under neuroleptics. So, following this lifestyle is just a life of licentious zombie. That's why nofap is felt like some kind of awakening from this detrimental plague. At least, you have to understand that nofap de-zombifies you. And this point is quite important, believe it or not."
none,"Just wondering, anyone experimented with this matter? Anyone who drinks decaf, do you experience sleep problems? If even low doses can cause this, it is needed indeed a strong drug."

none,"A week ago I wanted to get rid of mess behind my pc. Checked the books I needed, others took away. Suddenly I had found some weird piece of something. I thought that probably it should be some kind of chocolate. Later, I reminded myself that I hadn't bought any chocolate this year. And later some thought came into my mind... Yeah, what if it was some heroin? I crashed that stone, insufflated... and started feeling pretty awesome. You know, what's the funniest thing about this? I listened to Alice In Chains during my cleaning up, their album ""Dirt"", which themes almost all based in drug-related topics, especially heroin. The second impression (I quitted first time in spring, this year) of it was awesome the first time, later turning into nodding throughout reality. Some even found that I was ill, like got some cold (ha-ha). So, after three days of using I became bored and got rid of it. The other thing about it, which pissed me off was an inability to insufflate, like nose didn't want to get any of this. Now I'm sure I won't try anymore heroin, because it has no meaning for me. And now I don't know, was it really necessary to start that thing, that winter. I don't know. The only thing I can say, that it is a strong thing for physical/emotional pain (especially the second). I would even assume, that it is quite soothing up to the point it turns into a monster. Today I'm a bit ill, it has started since Wednesday. Hope it passes soon, don't like to experience something like flu. This time I didn't even bother to get rid of this, like it's a thing that belong to the past, not now. Something like that."
none,"Weird thing, when I withdraw from caffeine and fast for several hours upon awakening — I experience almost no anxiety, but when I eat something like an apple smoothie — I experience anxiety. Can anyone give some hint, why is this happening? I've heard that anxiety can be caused by ingesting of sugar, still it was more about artificial ones. Anyone experienced something like this?"

none,"Anyone tried guarana, kola nuts and other sources of caffeine, apart from ""standard ones"" like black/green tea, cocoa and coffee? Also, there was some Brazilian tea, forgot the name of it. Kola nuts were famous in the 19th century. Guarana also one of the components of energy drinks. Any reviews/opinions?"
none,"I remember I wanted to experiment a little bit with alcohol, just to compare is it differ from benzos and found out, that on alcohol I became easily enraged, even pissed, had even thought that I could kick some ass, just eagerly wanted to push someone, even fight. Several days after I remember how I saw lots of titles and news about how alcohol plays its dangerous role in domestical violence, for example, or, for example, alcohol is a lubricant for possible access to getting laid or something like that. I wonder, why alcohol can cause aggressiveness, up to fights with lethal outcomes? I remember vividly lots of news, where people used knifes, fight drunk or something like that. Is it possible to say, that alcohol is more inhibitory-driven, than benzos? Also, to compare benzos, barbiturates and alcohol, the first one is like feeling cool with possible black-out (I can't remember what was happening during my phenazepam uses, for instance), barbiturates (tried phenobarbital, feeling drunk as you don't give a flying fuck about anything and it's cool) and alcohol (after a glass of 12% alcohol wine I felt a bit euphoric, stupidly euphoric, to comedown I felt aggressive, started to do something to distract myself, because I was too pissed off). So, why alcohol causes aggression? If those compared drugs have something similar, why alcohol is a major cause of some kind of misfortunes, especially bloody ones? Your opinions? Like pissing off about bad quality of life?"
none,"Hi. I've been having dreams of drugs for the last month or two, still I haven't used anyone since May or beginning of June, apart from cigarettes and coffee/teas. What the hell is this? I can understand that dreams about heroin or meth are like reprogramming process of detaching myself from those substances. For the whole month I have had dreams about weed: two days ago my brother gave me some weed (in real life he doesn't smoke, lol), today some girls gave me pipe with weed and we were talking about cocaine, lol (also, I'm not interested in cocaine). A week ago in the dream I found nearly 12 g (!) of 2c-b (lol). Last time I used 2c-b it was 2014 or 2015, long ago. Can anyone say what the fuck is this? Why dreams tease me with drugs? Btw, I haven't smoked weed for almost 4 months (don't care about it). Still, in dreams someone surely will give me some weed, lol. It's like my dreamy self smokes weed instead of me. I'm tired of this ""teasing thing"". Has anyone had this? Any thoughts?"
none,"Recently I've been scrolling nofap subreddit and found lots of references to monk mode and its benefits. The only thing I wonder, for how long people who use or used this method follow/-ed this lifestyle? Only to archieve some success and to make a family? I'm curious about this thing because fap, porn and sex for me look like drugs, even hard ones. At the same time there was a book by Napoleon Hill about men potenial or something like that. Also, great people like Nikola Tesla arises in my mind and others. I'm asking because I yearn for greater purpose and sometimes I'm tired of this ""procreation urge"", like I want to do my stuff, like guitar, music, reading, finding something more, etc. Like this thing sometimes messes with my mind. Also, at the same time it is no option for me to go to date or something like that, because I don't want to and I don't want to have some negative possible outcomes. I wonder how can it be possible to redirect this reproductive function to my purposes? What are the secrets of the great ones? I ask because I'm trapped between porn issues and the pressure of my reproductive instinct, at the same time neither the first, nor the second is not an option. Honestly, with dating I became dissappointed and abandoned that. Rationally speaking, probably most would say — go and overcome your fears. And suffice to say, I can't, but I tried. Every time I tried — I just became frozen, like I was there with the function blocked or something like that. And every time it was like that. It's like some kind of restricted area, where you can't get. That's why I'm interested in other ways, like ""monk mode"". Don't tell me that mumbo jumbo thing ""you haven't met someone to do smth"", because I don't believe in that. Especially, knowing that all those things are like drugs. I wonder only is there anyone, who has some kind of the same or kind of looking stories? I think monks also go to monasteries or somewhere due to some differences and problems. As for me, I see to be with someone is like a prison for me. Like when you ride your bicycle alone — you choose the path, when you with someone — either yours or others. Also, if there are such practices like brahmacharya and celibacy, so possibly here can be something. Sorry for long-post, I'm just recently quite pissed and in some ways dissappointed in the ways that I'm a human with these animal-driven instincts. Because sometimes it just closes my eyes to see the other things. Sometimes has a feeling that it would be cool to have a button, when you can use it or turn it off for a while. It's like a battle between the body and the spirit, theologically speaking."
none,"When you make your tea the second time, use the same tea leaves you used for brewing. It will be a bit weaker and at the same time it will trick you that you have gotten your caffeine fix. Don't know about bags, yet it works with dried tea leaves."
none,"I remember in the beginning there was much more excited-like feeling and overtime it turns into something darker, than it was before. I remember feeling agitated, some kind awkwardness. Hard to recall it from my memory due to that caffeine high. I wanted to ask, when did you start experiencing anxiety and other ill symptoms? I suppose, when caffeine high dissipates due to tolerance and to use it every time, a person starts to feel bad effects of it. Strange, it looks like good effects of caffeine mask bad ones. And negatives can only be seen clearly with prolonged abuse of caffeine. You know, strange the thing that it is rarely considered as a drug, because caffeine looks like other stimulants — first time cool, awesome, later — ok, etc, up to feeling bad and need to function. It's like a caffeine-built society, i.e. delusion. Like caffeinated state of mind is the norm of today's society."
none,"Hi. I remember when I tried fluoxetine in the past, I was entirely sedating, even shitload of coffee couldn't help with that. Also, reading about antipsychotics, it is stated, that they cause sedation, sometimes even not that good. I'm just wondering, what is the difference between sedation of SSRIs and sedation of antipsychotics? Other examples of sedative substances are trazodone and quetiapine, the first is an antidepressant, the second is an antipsychotic, and both can be used as sedatives. What's the difference between their ""sedations""?"

none,"Hi. I wanna add some point of excessive caffeine consumption, that I experienced. When I drank too much and for extended periods of time, apart from my fattiness I experience(d) pain in my spine. Don't know, whether it is useful information, but I've been experiencing it recently. And experienced in the past.  So, outcomes the same. Thanks for listening."
none,"Please, don't tell me why I consumed that shit, main point here is not this. I know, it sounds weird, but I just read some papers and anecdotal reviews about this substance. And ingested some of this, just out of curiousity. Can anyone explain, how can this be? Now I'm sitting and listening to some music and properly hear, that music tuned down half-step or something like that. Even it sounds a bit weird for me. Anyone experienced something like that? Is there any other substance doing this weird shit? I've heard that some tryptamine causes auditory hallucinations, still can't recall its name, but I can assuredly say, that it was one of those synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. I just wonder why it happens, maybe some receptors activation? I just need some clue, if some can — I'd be happy and grateful. Thanks for listening."
none,"I'd be short. I'd say, that I was too anxious, when I used to watch porn and masturbate. Second, when I started vegan diet, excluding also gluten, my anxiety, caused by caffeine was not that intense, i.e. manageable. To summarize, porn, gluten and animal-based diet were the main contributors to increasing the effects of caffeine, like anxiety, racing thoughts, etc. Funny, that when I started vegan diet, coffee started to taste worse for me, like I feel disgust to consuming coffee, still teas in my favour (if to be consumed at all). So, my main message is appealing to see other factors, contributing to ill symptoms, like anxiety, etc. At least, what I've mentioned in my experience, really helped. Don't know, why I typed it down here, just needed here to speak for a while. Thanks for listening. Hope, this at least be interesting."
none,"I wonder whether caffeine leaves system quicker during faster or not. Also, I'm interested whether caffeine withdrawal subsides faster during fasting. Does anyone know something about that? Logically, if caffeine to be considered as a drug, toxin or something like that, body will get rid of any other unnecessary substances from the body faster, because: a) no need to absorb any nutrients from the food due to lack of it, ""free gut""  b) knowing that fasting ""purifies"" the body from unnecessary things, so logically it has to help to metabolize caffeine quicker, hence withdrawal ends also quickerAny thoughts/experiences on that? Any reply would be interesting. Thanks."
none,"Hi. I've come here with some burden in my family. My grandmother started to be a bit demential with some aggressiveness, also with some obsessive thoughts about money, flats, place of living with reminding of the past events, which had place. Also, there are some thoughts, which are partially delusional, like some events occurred in the past, but with the mix of something which wasn't there. Like she lives here, but thinks that ""she's there"" or something like that. So, my question is, can transition to veganism help her to get rid of this ill-fated things? I mean, if veganism is proved healthy and healthful in lots of aspects, so why can't it be helpful in situation like mine? If it is so, is there anyone, who had something like this with quite a positive outcome? If we come to physicians, they would prescribe something, hence we should pay money for meds, which actually only help to get rid of symptoms. And I'm not sure to do so, because I have a feeling, that if a doctor would prescribe something, it would be some kind of a benzo or antipsychotics, which are terrible things in the end, like aggressiveness will get away, but she would be even worse, especially knowing that these meds are used in asylums. Something like that. Thanks for reading. Any advice would be appreciated!"
none,"Is there any real absinthe? Has anyone tried it? Is it worth it? I just remembered in one movie with Johnny Depp, ""From Hell"", where he (the detective) smoked some opium and drank some absinthe. Is it even possible to find the real absinthe? What about the making of your own? Or maybe the all ""absinthe thing"" is a bit of overrated? What do you think? I'm familiar with whiskey, beer, wine, all the common alcohol, including vodka, rum, even various cocktails (which I don't like), portwine. We even mixed portwine with coca-cola, which was really good long ago. Am I missing something, if I haven't tried absinthe?"
none,"Recently, I've been looking for some information about caffeine and found, that caffeine decreases the effect of anti-epileptic drugs like phenobarbital and carbamazepine-like drugs.

If some can give some practical information, it would be useful. Thanks for your attention."

none,"Hi. Prior to this I used a little caffeine in the forms of coffee and tea. So, ingested it on empty stomach, approximately 4:30 am. To 5:00 I started seeing that mental processes in my brain changed, walls started morphing, interesting thoughts arose with a little feeling of anxiousness. Later, my room started to transform into various landscapes. Firstly, I was in a weird chamber with lots of light. Later, I was in some kind of life-drama, similar to ""Santa-Barbara"" thing, where I was some Spanish or Mexican dude, who spoke only in Spanish. Later, I was the Biblcal king Solomon, with beautiful curls and hair. When I visited toilet, I felt like I was an old man, with his un-powerful-ness, if it is right to say so. Back to my room, I understood, that life is a drama, with all joy and sorrow, like everything is nothing and nothing is everything. Also, this Buddhist thing ""form is emptiness and emptiness is the form"" was arisen in my mind. I was everything and nothing at the same time. Also, I felt that life has its ends, which is painful to understand and feel. What else? I wanted to share this with reddit, but I had such strong visuals, that it was hard to even go to my computer. I felt different lives during this trip. I even understood the meaning of the phrase ""THe way of all flesh"". We are born and we die. Also, I had even the thought, that if I knew where my life is going, it wouldn't be interesting at all. Also, I was quite amazed, what mushrooms showed me. I wept three times during my trip, living this all drama, happened during my trip. I didn't use any music. There was a feeling, that music itself played during my trip. I had no fear, I just knew that I couldn't do anything, just to feel the trip. You know, I used lots of substances, and the mushrooms were the most powerful I've ever seen in my whole life. Also, I've come to conclusion, that I have to choose my path in my life. There are a lot of ways, mushrooms showed me some of them, if it is possible to say so. Mushrooms reminded me some acid, but more easier on body, than acid. Acid is longer, that's all. To the end of the trip I had music in my head, like some noisy sounds from the Doom soundtrack (2016). Don't know why, but I liked that (lol). For now, I don't know how to feel after it. Even have questions, about what I saw yesterday. Even have a question, what it was? Just some experiences? Old lives of the past? Or just some archetypes of our human nature? Ironically, in this life I chose to learn Spanish, apart from English and a bit of German. I can say that experience itself was strong, it was quite cool. I have no fear in tasting any mushrooms. I wonder, what the ayahusca trip feels like? Is it stronger than mushrooms or weaker? Even lack of music during the trip was cool enough for me. I don't know, also, what 5+ grams of shrooms feel like. What those high dosages give to the person? Before this trip, I didn't believe I would even experience such strong visuals and lifescapes. Also, dissociation from my ego was not a fearful experience, but just entertaining. It was like I watched other lives, lives as a spectacle. Even now there is some feeling, that people just play their roles like the actors. And it is everywhere. In the shops, people sell goods, in the families people are parents and husbands and wives. It's like the way of life, ""the way of all flesh"". I haven't read that book, but I listened to one Gojira's album with the same title. I don't know. Everything is joy and sadness and everything is ephemeral. Life is complicated and easy at the same time. I knew that, but I now feel it. Sometimes I have even the feeling that books sometimes are useful and the same time they are just a intellectual masturbation or something like that. Weird thing is life, and at the same time is interesting. Sometimes painful, sometimes joyful. I guess that's all. Wanted just to share this. If some say, that mushrooms are fear-provoking, yes, sometimes, but fear only distract you from mushroom's experience. Fear is an inhibitor of any action, whether it's a trip, or some life occurence. Something like that, thanks for reading my long-post."
none,"I know that some people have broken their cycles of sleep, like they sleep during the day and staying awake during the night. I wonder, how can circadian rhythms be restored? I know that sleep deprivation for 24+ hours can help, but it can be broken due to strong desire to sleep. Also, sleep deprivation affect negatively the body itself. Also, I've heard that fasting can help, but haven't tried myself, because I really like to eat, that's why it's hard for me. I remember how speed helped me to stay awake, but speed costs some money and there are some risks to get it. I'm interested in the safest methods of restoring normal sleep timing, like going to sleep in the evening and waking up at 3-4 am. Any tips/hints? I tried melatonin in the past, still after it I felt drowsy, but I was awake, so not an option. Benzos? Also they cost some money. I don't want now to waste money on any drug, that's why I've asked this question above."
none,"Hi. I know that harmala is used with DMT. Still, I wonder, whether there is any usefulness in using it on its own. Is it worth it or just a waste of the plant? Anyone tried? Or it's just some kind of monkey business?"
none,"Hi. I've been making some experiments on myself with different food and came to conclusion that eating non-vegan food stops me from progressive in guitar, like my hands are tired more often. I wonder, what if vegan diet is helpful for those who engage in guitar playing? I mean, if non-vegan diet does something like this, it can be beneficial to go full-blown vegan diet without turning back. Vegetarianism was cool for me, when it became easier to jog and run, but now it's not enough. Yeah, I've lost some willpower, but I'm going back to veganism, because it's cheaper and it was helpful for me in guitar playing and running. More strength, I remember those times. Probably, I've not passed that test of time, so to speak. Still, I'm interested in opinions of other guitar players and runners. THanks."
none,"Hi. Yes, I still haven't quitted. With almost 1+ month of caffeine (with some unsuccessful breaks and attempts to quit) I started experiencing some paranoia, like I want to close my door for my parents not to come in and I've started to feel uneasy, when I approach my pc or touch some other things. Also, I started impulsively react to the fact, that someone is in my room or something like that. Also, I still smoke and it's hard to quit. I don't know, but I ingest too much. I don't know why I type this, but I started to be secluded from people overall. If everything would good, I'd get some NAC to try to quit, because I'm like a slave to these habbits (caffeine and cigarettes). Ironically, but now I'm watching Jim Jarmusch's ""Coffee and cigarettes"", where in the first scene one dude is shown pretty nervous, even anxious. Also, I started experiencing fear of darkness, especially when I go to sleep at night. Had even the feeling, that something in my room. Weirdly, but I experienced something like that in my childhood, when I tried to sleep and was covered with pillows and a blanket. But I remember how I was caffeine-free and lack of any fear of darkness. Also, sociophobia tendencies increased. I typed already in this sub, that I would gonna try once to quit. Maybe, showing what I experience can be helpful for someone, I dunno. Like knowing of possible bad things, it can help some to quit. Had also the thought, what if there is some ""cortisol addiction"" thing, i.e. to be addicted to stress? Just food for thought.P.s.: forgot to add: my left eye started to shake, like I'm having tic. Guess that's all for now."
none,"Is this substance helpful to get rid of caffeine and cigarette addictions? I can't myself do this, like my hand is getting to take some cup of coffee or tea. Today I woke up with uncontrollable wish to smoke some cigarette. For me it looks like I'm addicted. Like I'm ""covered"" with this thing and it's hard to get away. Anyone tried this? I've seen research about meth addictions and it looked like it worked. Still, I'm interested in more practical approach. Thanks!"
none,"Unfortunately, even good movies contain nsfw content. Be careful with it, if you intend to watch movies, because nowadays movies are fuelled with nsfw content. And it's rare to find a proper movie or series without any such a material. Be careful, because it can lead you to unnecessary lustful intentions. I say this, because there are triggers everywhere in the social media. Also, if you find yourself in this trap, I recommend you to cool down, because all the whole attention can descend from the mind to... you know where. So, be wary about this."
none,"Here it is:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_Nv11dYMsXQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nv11dYMsXQ)Don't know, I just wanted to share this song. Maybe someone would be interested. Also, there is collaboration between Fugazi and Wu-Tang Clan, called Wugazi. There is the same song, but with hip-hop band Wu-Tang Clan (""Sleep rules everything around me""). Both songs cool in different ways. Hope, this can be at least interesting. Thanks!"
none,"Anyone tried tripping while listening to Triarii or something like that? I think it can give some interesting experiences, like on MDMA or something like that. Probably, classical music can give interesting experience, also. What do you think? Example of this:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRz26XV4e3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRz26XV4e3Q)"
none,"Hi. I've come to one thought, that life is like a woman, that you love. Relationship between life and a man is like a real relationship, metaphorically speaking. The word ""life"", comparing to other languages seems to be a feminine nature, like ""vita"" in Latin, in Greek it is also the same. I guess,, attitude to life seems like a relationship between a man and a woman. Like if you do something terrible against yourself, like fap and watching porn, you have no love, like you fornicate, doing against life. Just sharing some food for thought. Thanks."
none,"I  think all the whole drugs can be divided into two categories — to degradation or to evolving. You can delve into hedonism, but is it all that you can get? I think self-pleasure partially is a good thing, but from the other sometimes it is necessary something more, like spiritual growth. It's like going into evil things and living style or based on kindness and evolving, moving forward in adult life, to become a pure adult, mature in understanding of life. I've understood that life, if based upon only egoism in its pure form leads only to hatred, laziness, etc. Like drugs can be used to form good thoughts and world-view and to negative view of the world. And I see that certain drugs can induce bad attitude to life, that's why comes the suffering. I think the psychedelics are created to progress a human in the spiritual things and attitude to life, while caffeine or tobacco can inhibit a person from the spiritual growth. You can agree or disagree, I appreciate any view, because any experience is subjective. I just, listening to some music soundtrack, want to share my thoughts with you, whether you like it or not. I want to stress on that anyone chooses where he or she wants to go and also the consequnces of the chosen decision. Be safe on anything you're doing. If you use — do it responsibly and know the goal you want to reach. Peace to all. Thanks for listening."
none,"I've seen that caffeine makes me narrow-minded in some ways and superficial in terms of reading. Like I read some book, but don't feel the deep levels of understandable information. For example, today I was reading admonitions of the holy fathers (correct me, if I used this wrong) and saw, that sometimes I couldn't feel the depths of their thoughts, like you read in a hurry, taking notes in short or something like that. I assume, that I cannot fully remember it, but some parts. While without caffeine I experienced that it is not hard to recollect it from my memory. Like if I read on caffeine, I don't use full potential, but use my potential partially, restricted by caffeine. I wonder, what if the web, made by the spider in that study also works in the human situation, but instead of the spider's web — the human's life? Imagine, if life becomes so distorted by caffeine, like the spider's web. If it is entirely so, we are living not in our full potential. Something like that."
none,"Hi. I'll be short in this. While walking some thought has come to my mind, like there is possibility of caffeine causing hair loss and thinning. Why that? Stress. Caffeine increases cortisol, which is personification of stress itself. What else? Consuming daily. Sum it up and you'll get the picture. I think, this can help both men and women to decrease their chances of possible baldness. Thanks for listening!"
none,"Hi, dear /nofap. I've found myself in the unknown territory. Pornography and masturbation are unhealthy practice, but I found that with women I don't feel safe, like shit-tests or other things, that seem ridiculous to me. I see it as a living near some volcano, that test your masculinity or something. Why should I always be something like that? Why should I always be tested by some woman? I've never seen sincerety or something like that. How you solved or solving this problem? I think not only I struggle with this. Women seem to be a natural alternative, but knowing that can be something unwanted, like cheating or something else make me think that it can a bit of dangerous thing. Because I experienced something like this. Also, pornography is not an option with masturbation. Prostitutes seem to be a cheap alternative, with less outcomes like alimony or something. Still, it lacks something else, like natural bonding or something. Sometimes I think, sorry to say this, like women seem to be more un-minded with their own hands, thinking only by their lowest reproductive organ. I'm not a mysoginist, but I don't trust them, because like they can harm me, even it sounds illogical. You may say that I have some ""feminophobia"" or something. Maybe I have a little, but predominantly have no trust in them. Don't know whether it is the nowadays spoiled world or something. Why I am asking this? Because I suppose there are some men, who also have troubles with this matter. I suppose, there are those who dissappointed in this matter, like living a life of a monk or something, even if there is some interaction with women, it will be like looking from long distance, like you observe a bacteria under the microscope or something. From my understanding, I also have a feeling, that even if I take some woman at home, I think she will start quarelling or something. And any test seems annoying to me. Any idea? I'm not whining, I just want to understand, maybe I'm missing something. I had streaks with 100+ days of nofap and abstained from long interactions with women, but if it is a short-term one — I can abandon it and will surely do. Also, I don't want to ""dissolve"" in someone, like it's losing my freedom. Also, as far as I remember myself, I always saw women as those, who took me away from my goals. Sometimes I even think that this world doesn't appreciate being of a human. Like the lowest things can be done here, in this world, but the most beautiful are less valuable. Sometimes also there is a feeling of nihilism, due to this understanding that the world has a lot of bad and painful things. Something like that, thanks for listening."
none,"Recently I've started to study the possibilities of affecting the DNA, and you know what I've found? Caffeine looks similar to nucleotides, like adenine and guanine. They all have similar structure. Also, it is necessary to add, that adenosine looks similar too. I wonder, whether caffeine affects DNA itself, making epigenetic changes via its action. Technically, if it is so, those changes can be transmitted to the children of those people. Like, if you experience anxiety, children of those, who used caffeine, theoretically can be more prone to anxiety or something. Like an analogy with alcohol and its possible consequences in birth defects, deficits, etc. It's my hypothesis. Still, if it is so, the only change to get rid of this changes and the ""burden"" of those parents do, is to get rid of the things the parents did. Sounds a bit complicated, but curious. Have you got some thoughts like that? I see epigenetics as a promising branch of studying."
none,"Well, I'm tired of this. Knowing all the cons of it, I still used it today. Tomorrow I'm gonna quit it. Wish me luck. Probably, I'll try to write down every cons and make the post later. Because some things about caffeine cannot be found, like scientific prooves only show mechanism of action more predominantly, etc. I'll quit it because I started feeling a bit of paranoiac with extreme anxiety and delusional. If needed more information — I can a post later, if there are requests here. I encourage you, also, to quit. Maybe even try it for a while, just to see. I remember how it was good, even abstaining from caffeine for 2-3 days. So long!"
none,"Hi. I've reminded how I tried fluoxetine in 2015 and was extremely sedated like even a lot of caffeine couldn't get rid of this sedation. I just wonder whether other SSRIs do the same. I just want to hear experiences from those who tried this. I have no a thought or idea to use it, but I'm just curious."
none,"Hi. Remembering my past experiences and alcohol, I started thinking, what if those drugs make you say the things you don't like to. Knowing that people do weird things under alcohol, I remember sometime in the past, while drunk, I spoke about weird things about amphetamines. Also, speaking about benzos, I tried phenazepam and today I can't remember, what was there. I remember how I get that thing, ingested, later remember how I spoke with parents, but don't remember what I was doing and speaking about. Question still remains alive about what I was speaking about. Is it possible that I spoke about unnecessary things? Have you experienced something like that? I'm just wondering, how many crucial things I've made and what the things I said in the past. Still, I wonder, is it real me, that was released, after drinking alcohol or ingesting benzos. I remember how I read article about Philip Dick, where was reminding of ""truth serum"", but he said about sodium pentothal, i.e. barbiturate. Also, later I found that barbiturates, alcohol and benzos have somewhat similar action via GABA. In the light of this, how GABA is connected with disinhibition, i.e. removing defensive mechanism of psyche? What do you think? I have a feeling, that Philip Dick knew, what he was talking about, especially knowing what kind of books he released.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuj6F8L9GOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuj6F8L9GOE)"
none,"Hi. I once did overcome this, but I was visiting prostitutes in the past. Now, I don't want to spend money on this. Also, I've found, that I don't know how to properly overcome it. In the past I had some wishes to come true in real life. But, now I've found, that all my wishes are worthless, like I don't want to archieve anything and it's hard to do nofap. Also, I don't want my goals to be like ""for finding some women"", because in my past experiences I had more pain, than pleasure from them. Also, I've understood that I have never had any proper friend, like they want something, that's all. I'm not sociophobic, but not interested in human communication, but I don't mind if any would be, for example, during my walking through the park or something. Suffice to say, I had thoughts about loneliness in the past, during schoolyears, like I want to be alone, that's my choice. Now, I don't know how to overcome this lust, only one thing helped me with it was an opioid, especially heroin. Like it destroyed it and I experienced no lustful intentions and I didn't care any of this thing. Now it's like I'm bombarded with this thing, lust. Still, I have a thought that some heroin can help me, but lazy even to get it, probably knowing its withdrawal symptoms. But, still, long-run motivation is weak. What can I do in this situation? I'm lazy to go outside even. I'm just tired of this lust. I don't want to see my motivations to look like for attracting women or something. For me it looks like a slave gets some motivation, that's all. Is it this way? I don't believe that we're descendents of animals, like Darwin's theory. I want to believe that we're more than that, because if it is not like this, people like Tesla, probably would not be born. Still, there is something that stops me from going further. Honestly, I'm tired of all of this. And yeah, please, don't tell me to make motivation to get some women, I prefer silence in my house, instead of quarrels or other braincopulating techniques. Can I change my motivations, like programming myself as I wish? As far as I know, instincts in animals are those things, which cannot be undone, like animals is submitted to do, to make instinct come true. But a human can say ""no"" in such situations. What am I missing here? There should be something, that stops me. Thanks for your reading!"
none,"Hi. I've been looking for some tips on how quitting caffeine. As far as I know, the best ways to do that is to do physical exercises and eat more raw food. But when I try to do that I have urges to eat processed food. Hence, I've found myself in vicious circle — if I start doing one thing — I'll experience some urges to do another thing. Like eat some hard food, want to sleep, later ingest caffeine. I once ""cheated caffeine withdrawal"" by using amphetamine, but I guess it's like changing one thing on the other. Still, though, for me quitting amphetamine is easier, than caffeine. I know, I may sound a bit whiny, but I guess I miss something. What can you propose in my situation?"
none,"Has anyone had something like this? I used Natrol 600 mg, one capsule. Shall I be worried about something or is it a normal thing on alpha lipoic acid?"
none,"Does anyone experience something like this? I've heard some doesn't experience this thing, my acquaintance said he never experienced this thing. What about you? Every time I smoked — I experienced my body's shaking."
none,"What in your opinion is worse for you — first one or second one? I've been thinking and can't even exactly say what is detrimental. But I guess, caffeine is more anxiety-provoking. At least for me. What do you think?"
none,"Hi, I've been wondering, is drug use some kind of protest or the thing like having fun? I don't know, if I asked this question here, but I've mentioned that to the end of my 20s I started experience some kind of distraction from drug use. Like it was fun, but at the right time. Is there any, who use drugs at their 30s? I just wondering. I have a feeling, that it's a temporary, like you try, have experiences and go forward. What do you think? Do you still use something?"
none,"Yesterday I smoked my last pack and today I can't even concentrate on my video game. What's wrong? Is it really the so-called withdrawal symptoms of cigarettes? If it is so, how long should I wait to see my uncomfortable symptoms subsided?"
none,"Hi. Wanna to use some shrooms and last MDMA on birthday, what's the best timing to do them both? Can't MDMA make the trip itself in another direction? Is it worth it? I used once long ago, doing MDMA first, later ingesting mushrooms. I remember that I felt that I was big, later turning into small. When I took mobile phone in my hands, had a feeling that phone itself is bigger, than me. Or do better shrooms and MDMA separately? Still, I think MDMA can be used to just ease the trip, like an automatic anxiolitic effect, which leads trip into peaceful realm or something like that. What do you think? Experiences?"
none,"Anyone tried this? I've heard about psylohuasca, but I'm not sure about its using. Is it safe? I've heard that it's possible. Your experiences? Interesting to hear respond from this warm subreddit."
none,"Do any of you experience problems with falling into sleep, after your last smoked cigarette? Just curious. I sometimes feel, but sometimes. What about you?"
none,"I'm wondering about the least sedating ones. I've tried phenazepam, which is quite good for sleep. Diazepam? In light doses fine, but when moderate or high ones are just creating an urge for me to sleep. I also have tried tofisopam, the least known, which is stimulating a bit, but also creates anxiolysis with weak sedation. Maybe, I'm looking for alprazolam? Any suggestions?"
none,"I deleted my social web page and later felt quite relaxed, even thoughts started coming into my mind. Deleted Starcraft, old buddies with whom nothing connect me with. Now I feel quite... free. Even playing a single game I feel free! Not stressed, pissed, etc. I even when bored in a single game I easily quit. So, competition some kind of a drug. Social webs also addicting, like competitive gaming. I guess, if you wanna quit games — stop playing multiplayer. I also marked, that if I play alone — I play for a day, even with doing my other things. So, I guess the main point to return to yourself or something like that. Single games, as for me are not that harmful, like multiplayers. Still, multiplayers can be also, like Dead Space 3 — you play for a day or two with your peer and later quit, so nothing serious. Something like that. Social webs are a wormwhole, which consumes you. I assume it's better not to speak with others in social webs at all. Got a phone? Got a number? Go outside, it's more productive. Not speaking in chats or other crap. Social webs sometimes like a... whorehouse or something like that. You see these pages and see not people, but imitation of a person, nothing else. Also, privacy is lost. Ironically, that it is called a web. Remember, how web is used in other circumstances? Yeah, catching fish. And fish is caught. In the Internet."
none,"Hi, I've experienced with all above mentioned substances and found out, that nicotine seems for me to be quite superior for appetite suppression. Even amphetamine can't give me the same effect, as cigarettes smoking. I can smoke without any reminding of any food intake. Caffeine is a weak, as for me. Your experiences? What works for you better for anti-hunger purposes?"
none,"Has anyone experienced something like this? I drank today and was attacked by flow of thoughts, especially negative. Ironically, but when I smoked a bit of cigarettes — it eased. Any stories?"
none,"Has anyone experienced some kind of apathy after MDMA usage? I mean if used often like one time per month? I have a feeling that it is even more harmful than amphetamine, because after amphetamine I restore quite fast."
none,"As for me, brain fog, caused by cigarette subsided. Is there any effect of menthol on nicotine itself? Someone experienced something like this?"
none,"Interestingly, but every this type of a drug makes you, even creates in you urge to defecate. Is it due to D2 receptor or something? Amphetamines, caffeine, nicotine — all the same. Do you experience the same?"
none,"Looking for some sleep pills, I haven't found any, but old phenobarbital. Jeez, will never touch it again. Today I feel quite sludgy, even benzos are easy for me. Any barbiturates the same?"
none,"Does nicotine make caffeine effects more smooth? I feel easy after smoking a cigarette. Also, in the past I found a paper in science journal, that nicotine fastens metabolism of caffeine. What do you think about that?"
none,"Hi /nootropics. I just bought some DMAE in sport shop and tested for a while (7-14 days). Things I've seen after its usage — 500-1000 mgs: vivid dreams, extra aggressiveness, don't sure about anxiety (due to caffeine), sometimes I feel like I'm ""too pushy"", like I can smash my surroundings via verbal battle. What is it? Also, I've not seeen more motivation or something like that, still jogging is quite pleasurable, because I can sustain its action quite easily. Still, I'm not sure of its effects on dopamine system. Are there any? I ask about dopamine thing, because here, in this subreddit, someone recalled the thing called ""tardive dyskinesia"", i.e. movemental side-effects of anti-psychotics. Knowing anti-psychotics nature, they are predominantly dopamine antagonist. That's why I'm interested in a ""dopamine thing"". Also, I've seen that I can sleep more. Yesterday I used a 15 mg pill of hydroxyzine (atarax) and later 2,5 mg phenazepam, later finding I was sleeping for such a long time!Another uncomfortable thing I've marked with using of DMAE is headaches, which cannot be eased even with 400 mg of ibuprofen.So, my plans are the following: ween off caffeine to see the pure effects of DMAE and take it for a month to see its proper effects.What do you think about aforewritten?**Edit:**I remember how I used DMAE after almost 500-600 mg amphetamine binge throughout almost 2 days and after ingesting of DMAE I started to feel that amphetamine effects becoming smooth and eased. So, my hypothesis about some action with dopamine is still in action. Also, some users (anecdotally) report depression, which can be described via my little experiment. So, possibility is existent. Weirdly, but I saw some visionary hallucinations, like if you look in the door eye you can see something different. For  example, I have some boxes, but while I saw in the door eye — I saw two blond women with a little dog, opened the door — they disappeared. Ironically, the door was also closed. Still, that day I was sleep-deprived, but used 1000 mg of DMAE with caffeine drinks. So, something weird about that ""DMAE"", as for me.Plans changed. I took a break for some time and see if something is changed. If my hypothesis is correct — I will see changes. If anecdotal reports are true, so benefits are not worth of it. Still, I bought it just to see incredible dreams (rofl). If someone is interested — I'll report if anything changed (anyway will do, because there are lots of enthusiasts in this world).**Edit 2:**Used 1800 mg of NAC today, brain fog, caused by DMAE is reversed. Probably will never touch DMAE again.**Edit 3:**Found some scientific links (may be interesting):[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00427135](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00427135)[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-2934-3\_3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-2934-3_3)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4075918](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4075918)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7020434](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7020434)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/117492](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/117492)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/406628](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/406628)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1224003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1224003)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1092513](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1092513)"
none,"I was depressed, pissed, hated everyone, wanted to collapse the world. Screamed at those who surrounded me. I used 3 little packs of black lipton tea per a cup. 3 such cups per a day. I fell into full-blown misanthropy, using f and c word about people and women. A prefer to abstain from such strong words, but I used them with utmost abhorrence like I was possessed. I don't know what it is. Still, jogging helps to get rid of it. Now I'm gonna jog, and how do you do?"
none,"Hi, I used amphetamine just to ease off my heroin relapse, with finding DMAE helps with amphetamine comedown, like it's easier, than it is by itself. I used 250 mg for the first 20 mins, waited more 15 minutes. Even 500 mg of DMAE was strangely helpful in this approach. I used Maxler DMAE 250 mg. ~~Honestly I used 500 mg more, but it doesn't matter, everything continue going to be fine.~~ DMAE was bought out of curiousity just to enhance dream-like states. Heard also it can rejuvenate the skin. That's all I know.I just share it with you for the sake if it can be helpful to some. Just subjective description of the experience. Also, I feel a bit of calm, relaxed and focused, even after amphetamine comedown. I was weirdly surprised. Especially knowing that I used amphetamine for 24 hours or something like that with not so low doses (I want to quit it; also have a feeling that it's not that pure). Maybe my experience can intrigue somebody, who knows. I've just shown what I experienced — you can believe it or no. Still, My wayward path to sobriety is still my primal goal.P.s.: Hope I will never get back to heroin, amphetamines and methampetamines. Also, wanting to add MDMA and related to it compounds, due to their effects of using your reserves to make you feel good. Caffeine also, but in a weaker manner, than amphetamines. Hope this was helpful."
none,"Ho /drugs. I tried pure meth yesterday and the day before it. To the end of the first day I started experiencing minor hallucinations, lik a woman was sitting in the grass. Later, the next day, I saw a cat under the chair in the entrance. Also, during my night journey I had a feeling that someone  was there, but I don't really why who could be there. Like people a bit persisted to do this things. Now I think, that I'll quit amphetamine type of drugs, because  they potentially can lead you into such an anxiety-fueled state, later turning into paranoia. Weirdly, but caffeine can make you anxiety develops faster, but amphetamine's one is tougher and it shows itsef during the binge  period or additional"
none,"I have only just one question: if I ingest 4 g of psilocybin mushrooms, using church-like music, tibetan mathras, practicing abstention, strict vegan diet — will it help me to re-unite with God? Experience this whole experience, where everything has its sense. Has anyone felt something like that?"
none,"Hi. How did you get there? Can you tell me some stories about your ways to it? I think not from good lives people descend down to heroin. What's the magic behind it, that makes you alive for a while, later making you pay a lot more? Any description will be fine, even from esoteric point of view. What people find in heroin, that they lack in real life? Love? Money? What really matters for those people? Lack of communication? There should be something, apart from the common interest. PLease, people, I want to search for truth and will be happy if you help me in doing that. Thanks for listening and pre-supposal speaking."
none,"Hi /drugs. No place to type anywhere. I just popped up 200 mg mdma, thinking that it can help me to understand myself. I've lost everything — friends, acquaintances, even possibilities. I'm sitting at my house with a feeling like I'm slowly dying. What can I do in this situation? I'm a sociophobic person, I don't trust people, but I suppose due to my bad-boyness or some kind of this. How to overcome this emotional crisis? I'm in my older 20s, that's why I'm asking. Schoolfriends are no more, because they are the others, not like me. Some are doing their job, so no time for me. I'm just alone. I spoil time, playing computer games. Even with self-destructive impulses. What kind I do? Someone has seen and experienced something like that, that's why I'm asking. It's hard for me to love, like I promised to be it closed for others. I don't know really, especially knowing that I'm a man, who suppose to solve his problems alone. Just a piece of advice or maybe hint. I have no money, typical basement dweller, ex-heroin addict who stole money. Where is the sunshine?"
none,"Hi /drugs. Suppose, any drug causes depletion of certain elements. I remember old mantra, spoken by drug users, for instance, if you use amphetamine — you should replenish your calcium levels. About weed I remember, that people recommend to eat more vitamin C. About MDMA it is widespreadly known, that 5-htp is a magic tool to restore serotonin levels. What about opioids? Heroin? There should be some guide or advice list for those who eager to restore their system after drug use. Let no one delude oneself that any drug uses organism vitamins, nutrients, etc. Organism reserves are used anyway and it's an objective thing. So, any advice? Or it is better to buy a full-blown vitamin and mineral complex, a-la made in NOW companies and something like that? Or is it better to just switch to raw food diet with its potential to fullfill reserves of the organism. Any opinion?"
none,"Hi /drugs. Everything started quite good, quite euphoric, but now I'm in my lows absolutely. Heroin, called smack, is an awesome thing, up to the moment it bites you. After heroin I feel a bit atrophic, like it's hard for me to do even some typical things in my real life. I even lost in my life. What about speed? It makes you want to do something, but not by yourself, but by its effects on you. Still, it starts euphorically awesome, turning into the so-called ""8 amphetamine stages"". Speaking about weed — it was cool, but with sativa strains. Indica tends to dumb you down, at least it was in my occurence. Something like that. After it I started to feel that drugs give you pain at the end. That's why I'm wondering about a sobering up. I don't know what to do with my life — the whole a half a year was filled with drugs. Even my relatives tell me to stop, because you've become a nonchalant person. Maybe, the whole drug thing is not that safe, as it looks like? It's like I've reached dead end, where drugs follow you into nowhere.Also, at the end of my 20s I've found, that this drug thing looks like a period of ""20-25"", maximum. Like after it there is something else, another period of life, maturity of something. Like drugs are not applicable here or something like that. After that, I even wonder, how can this be that after such a half a year binge there is such a strong fall out of the drugs world. Even weed started to bite me. Probably, even fate says it's time to end this. Still, I'm a bit of undecisive towards drugs I have. Like they have no point for me, but at the same time I have a feeling that I paid for that. And if I get rid of that — I'll get rid of my money. Like I'm a bit of greedy.tl;dr: Beginning of drugs are good, euphoric, while the end is tough and painful sometimes.Thanks for listening!"
none,"Hi /drugs. Is it good to use MDMA, after the weekend of amphetamine using? I used a lot, I'd say. Still, will MDMA work, if I use it today? I've found myself on some kind of cul-de-sac, that's why I'm wondering if MDMA can do its job."
none,"Hi /drugs. I just weirdly understood that it's hard to remember who I was on opioids, like an another human being, not myself. Like you were quite cool, but later it's even hard to remember those things. Also, the same thing I saw, when I used speed. Like it's hard to remember those events or things happened during those highs in detail. Have you experienced something like this? Just wondering. Also, 2 weeks without heroin, but with feeling of a bit of empty."
none,"Hi /stopgaming. After that weekend I've found out, that I'm tired of games. The last favourable games were ""Quantum Break"", ""The Evil Within 1&2"", ""Prey"" and cooperative game Dead Space 3. That's all. Also, I've been playing Starcraft: Brood War since 2004-2005 or somewhere. However, now I'm finding that reality a bit of painful, because I was like an outsider everywhere. Games were my comfort zone. Today, I'll start getting rid of this gaming stuff, because I want to reach something in life. Something natural and not virtual, still virtually you can help people. Also, it's hard to find and interesting game — lots of zombie stuff, strategies like Starcraft 2 became worse for me, subjectively. It's like eating away your problems. Something like that. I suppose, that all-time gaming should be dismissed. Still, if there is really great game with a touchy soundtrack, I'd spend a bit of time, while I'm in the city (I want to go in the country). Speaking about soundtracks, something like this:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Mt6f3MSgk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Mt6f3MSgk)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXk-OE55pgw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXk-OE55pgw)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JwkOoIAxVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JwkOoIAxVE)The only thing, why I adore games, because some rare music gems can be found there. I don't know, maybe I've become a bit of depressed or emotional (also have transferred to veganism).Thanks for listening, wishing well."
none,"Hi /drugs. It's eighth day of heroin-free lifestyle. Also, it's the third of no tramadol in my system. My greatest love are towards those who are dwellt in opioid addictions. There is nothing good. At once, at the beginning you are the alpha and you are the omega, later turning into creep, tiredly breathing whilst laying on your bed with sweating, pain in your muscles and other symptoms. I can write here with an aid of 50 mg of speed, only. I'll try to have some little jog for a while in order to restore my endorphins. I thought beforehand it would be an intereresting experience up to the moment it turns hell for me with these aches. You know, Alice In Chains's ""Dirt"" is fueled with the time behind dose and opioid withdrawal. Honestly, if I go this way — I will lose myself, like I lost any sense, except heroin in this three and a half months! Holy Moses, how can this be! I don't know how William Burroughs lived this lifestyle for such a prolonged time! Speaking about myself: I don't know where to go and what to do for now, but remembering the last year — I was alive, at least this feeling attracts me to that time. Also, opioids are the way to destruction, still they smell sweet and they grant you all-replaciveness of your life. You even forgot about you cleaning house habbit! Heroin comes into the first place, that's what I learn. I even, while laying on my bed, was thinking how money they make on people's suffering. Also, I thought to applying to sobriety lifestyle. Even though, after several days ago acid trip I wondered, how can I find a woman of my own, if my such an douche? I ever remembered how I was extremely strict with those, whom I had in the past. Like I had acquaintances, but delt with them with extreme cruelty, like something dark inside of me wanted to make harm to them. And now I am alone.People, don't be cruel to each other. Learn my lesson. Cruelty leads towards loneliness. No one wants to spend time with a cruel dick, who thinks he's better than the other. During opioid withdrawal I cried about that, cried about people who left this Earth early. Like I have something familiar with them. Let's make the world better. Even I have nothing for now — it doesn't mean that I would have nothing to show or say always. I'd try my best to get away from this opioid world, but knowing there is nowhere I can go... it's deplorably sad. But, I suppose, it's the ""reap what you saw"" proverb proclaims, right? You won't get the results quite fast, but you will get them at the moments of your extreme need, when you need someone, but at the same time lost someone in the past, who could help you now. Sounds quite philosophical, though really depicturing itself in this very matter. But who knows, that I would require them? Life lessons are prolonged at time, thus making us learning at lots of level, we can't behold altogether.Hope, my peace of work can help someone. Peace to you, hope your withdrawals may be eased! Thanks!"
none,"Hi /drugs. It should be fine weather today, that's why comes the question — will I be fine, if I use 100 ug LSD? I've lost myself on this road, called life, that's why I'm asking. I saw threads with LSD reviving them entirely."
none,"Hi /drugs. Recently, I've come to conclusion that I'm bored with drugs and I have no wish to do any lately (just finish my tramadol for heroin withdrawal, that's all). And here comes the question: how often do you find yourself sober or practice sobriety? I guess, if going hard about drugs — it can lead into nightmare or any destructive sequence, thus this question has arisen. Do you find sobriety pleasureable? I remember the time when it was quite interesting, when I quitted caffeine in the summer 2018. I was sober, walking through the street with the feeling of absolute nonchalantness, late laying on the ground and looking at the sun. It was awesome. Also, it sound ridiculous, but after I used some benzos a week ago — I lost my weed, lol. Like, I totally don't know where it is. Also, has a question: are there any so-called drug waves, where the act and feel quite effective, like once in a half of a year, or once a year? I've caught myself on the thought, that it's hardcore to use drugs for prolonged periods of time, like for a half of a year (I've been using them since summer 2018, when I found tramadol, later buying speed, weed and tried heroin, lol). What's your opinion on the waves of sobriety and drug occupation? If you psychedelics too often — they can turn into something bad, like MDMA: there is a rule of ""three months"" for a good roll. Maybe, there is a rule for all drugs, existing on this Earth? Thanks for listening, waiting for your kind answers and honest opinions, thanks."
none,"Recently, upon first three day of heroin withdrawal I used the notoriouis phenazepam, later findiout that I felt some kind of vertigo, like shaking back and forth, after awakening. All the three days I used 5 mg dosage just in order to get some sleep and to sleepfully forget about that withdrawal-fueled tension. After, I question several interesting question: are GABA drugs supposed to cause movement imoairment and problems with memory. Even after those very three days I exoerienced some light memory malfunction, like some temporary congitive deficits with existense of vertigo matters. What are your experiences wtih benzo-type of drugs? I the second time experienced memory problems with some dizziness."
none,"For example am myself is into the thing called yearning knownledge from any drug possible. Now, after 3 days of withdrawal I know it's terrible. So, probably, I'll switch to my 10 days tramadol 400 mg prolonged release plan. It worked. Still, though I felt emptified. What other routes of releasing yourself from this damned opioid hell, leasured with lots of interesting thing — running from yourself, doing actual thing that are quite necessary. Some are even run away from their sexuality. I'm quite strong on discussion of this topic, though I'm a bit of on amphetamines. Still, they only make me move further for now. Probably, if something gonna be worse — I'll create some kind of helpful ambulecery, though illegal, but with sharing my advices and my seeing of situation. Peace to y'all. So, to speak, I suppose, not only just by coincidence I| came here but with something more."
none,"Every context expalined by Layney and other rock musicians of the same time. I remember myself quiet creative during ""h-stage"", really-really. But now I fear I become the real me with its disadvantages. I screammed at my mom, that if lots money on this dirty scag — I would be wary my surplaces are coming to end. Is there any life after heroin? I don't know. The only thing I think I feel my body a bit of broken, like pain in the body, still the better, that yesterday or the first day. Sp, any life after heroin exposure? I remember myself like a hero, doing whatever I want. And when this pack is gone... I'm quite miserable. Smoked some weed, ingested phenazepam. That's all. Any advice?"
none,"Hi y'all. Automatic bot — I beforehand tell to you, I'm known with this substance. I just wonder about users of this substances — what do you find interesting in it, making you stick to its usage from time to time? What is the most amazing about it? What about stories, known or notoriously-filled with cocaine, which you really know, experienced or something like that? Any particular film or consequences, describing its long-term effects? I've known with amphetamine, that it can cause anhedonya, even there is a famous list of ""amphetamine stages"". So, what's your opinion about cocaine? I'm just interested in terms that whether if I miss something about it, or just do it in some wrong way. I just snorted, felt that numbing cessation around my throat, felt quite good for some 30 minutes, cranky or something like that with feeling a bit of rage afterwards, on comedown. What else? I also had a feeling that it would be better to buy some meth on the same money, because strategically it would be more financial-wise, than buying coke. But it's only my thoughts on this. Wondering the thoughts of others, like an old adage or proverb says, like ""fools don't learn, wise learn by their mistakes and the sages do it by learning theirs and others"", so I'm doing this thing doing the third approach. Anyway, I guess there is nothing wrong to gain wisdom, even it can be on /drugs subreddit with coke oriented verses. From heroin I got some wisdom, amphetamine also got me some, that's why I spoke about coke. But, weirdly, using the whole day that 0,5 g hadn't even given me any deep insight, only paranoia on comedown with fearful sensation.Subjectively I can only say, that the most powerful thing, surrounding cocaine is that it is short, thus you can go to sleep quite early, like any need of benzo, z-drug or weed is unnecessary. What else? I liked to listen to the famous song of Buckcherry about cocaine (that's why I also used cocaine). About heroin I had a dream to listen to some song about heroin of Alice In Chains and also the songs of the Velvet Underground, that's it. Also, I can add that cocaine is fueled with its image of success, like you're a zillionaire, who can do it any time you want, even snorting this powder from the  ass of any beautiful girl with it's necessary and willing to do by some odd idea, or just wish.Thanks for listening, dear drugsters."
none,"Hi /drugs. I'm quite experienced with drugs — try MDMA in the past as long as MDA. Still, the first question comes by: which one from MDMA or MDA you prefer more, explain why. Second question: have your tried something, apart from the famous two empathetic molecules, begetting love for several wondrous hours? What about MDEA, MMDA and others? I once tried nutmeg, which is believed by Shulgin, that it is metabolized into MMDA. But, remembering my subjective experience, I know that it is not that pleasant, so don't know, maybe someone loves that. i just wonder, if there is any MD\* family lover, who can scrutinizingly describe his or her experiences with these substances. Thanks for listening. Would be a pleasure to speak with you."
none,"Hi /drugs. I've finished exploring amphetamines, ending up with anhedonia. Speaking about heroin — tomorrow I'll use remaining 150-250 mg and finish its usage entirely, too. TRamadol used also. Tried coke: weirdly dissappointed, feeling like something overvalued thing. Have a wish to try modafinil, that's all. Any recommendation? Not psychedelics, pleases. MDMA, LSD, 2c-b should be used in some special cases, while others can be used from day to day or just whenever you want. What can you advice to try? I just only want to try modafinil for now and take a break with the feeling, like I don't know what to use also. What can you add? What can you advise? I'd be greatly happy, if someone shows something, that I've overlooked. Thanks for listening."
none,"Hi. Sorry, I'll be a bit of a ""bad boy"", but I would say: have you ever smelled your shit, after defecating? No wonder you can die, knowing it's repugnant smell, making any living creature to be transformed into the essence, fumed by death. And imagine how you hold this in your intestines due to opioid constipation. I used heroin for almost an entire day and later, after feeling sick and shitting incredibly I can say — woah, man, it smells terrible. This smell can kill anyone (pun intended). So, if you even use opioid — do something to get rid of the shit or don't use opioid overall. I've ended. Thanks for listening of my ""pushed into you"" reply."
none,"Hi. I wouldn't be such an annoying and ask you straightforward. What the most predominant and most dangerous side effects you have seen, while using any drug of morphinan class or any other opioid? For example, today I've come with the hypothesis that there can be some link with lack of calcium in those who uses opioids, meanwhile there is also one thing, called ""low testosterone thing"", which can lead also to low calcium levels. I've come not to argue, but to ask you, what have you seen, experienced or understood, while on any opioid binge or any use you have had? Just be yourself. The reason why I started this topic because my heroin is ending, amounts of it shall be nullified soon. And, honestly, while I had it — I'd like to share any talk with you, because know I'm stalwart at my attempts to getting rid of it eternally. Like I had a wish to try it — now I know what is it, can quit it and go forth, crossing it on my paper list, thus forgetting about it. Thanks for listening."
none,"Hi /drugs. Recently been searching for aiding to overcome heroin addiction and found this. What do you think about this? I'm just interested in it because it is OTC, that's the first thing I have to mark upon. If there is something OTC it would be even better. Thanks for listening."
none,"Hi /drugs. I have a feeling that some day in the future I'll quit heroin, like it's magic will fade away entirely. I'll describe how it sounds to me: any substance I use has its honeymoon, during which I gain lots of knowledge, insights, etc, etc. Ironically, but on heroin I started to question myself about love matters, what is love really, how it manifests itself, etc , etc. It can sound hereto also odd, but remember, that any person is unique. So, I come straight away into the matter of subject. I'm a bit of lseep deprived, so please, don't say like I'm speaking a bit limply. First way of approach to quit heroin is to use tramadol, still, I remember felt quite drained later, because tramadol is some kind of pseudo-ecstasy, if you have ever tried that. The other option I used — just use benzos to sleep all days. What other options? Kratom? Buprenorphine? Methadone? What do you recommend for me to quit? What is the most effecient of the aforecalled substances? I need an advice from some kind of scholars or even more preferable from practitioners, who quitted successfully.  I don't want to be some kind of dick to just come here, question and go away. I can also answer some of your questions, if you need some advice. Let's just share a friendly talk, wherein we can exchange useful advices between ourselves. Also, I tried to use amphetamine for quitting heroin. Bad idea. Lots of anxiety, increadibly uncomfortable. So, fellas, I suppose, I described my whole picture entirely. Here I can get tramadol, methadone, buprenorphine, some kratom, ibogaine. What do you recommend and how to do it better?You know, it's hard to quit also due to the fact, that it makes all your entire existence smooth and peaceful. Knowing also, that heroin makes you anxiety absent. But, the most prominent and useful thing to do is to quit caffeine — almost half of it will be gone.I need just advices, followers of this sub. I have no problems with my family, I started to love them on heroin. You know, it sounds weird, but I understood the word ""love"" on heroin, because the word ""love"" outside of heroin was always lust for me. It's like heroin shew me what I was, but without lust. I'm a human, but with some addiction to heroin. How to safely quit heroin with the saving of a newly-obtained personal improvements? Any argument, any talk would be appreciated — I love to speak with people. I even like to bury all remained ashes of my misanthropy, because I don't need them any way. I need only love and making good things in m entire existense. I was a full-blown sinner, with a big list of broken women's hearts or something like that. I jus t wanna to be a better person more. Heroin gave me some lessons, but now I can follow on my own, still, I need some support from those, who already overcame itl."
none,Hi /drugs. Is it possible that there are some compounds like substituted benzoylmethylecgonine? What do you think also about some kind of psychedelic opiod? What do you think about that? I'm just curious.
none,"Hi  /drugs. Yesterday I ingested \~ 70 mg of snorted heroin and 30 minutes  later 125 mg orf MDMA. While cleansing the capsoules of other powder (it  was piracetam) — I ingest it also, approximately 800 mg of piracetam.  No weed smoked. After ingesting I went for a walk, even for a jug, felt  quite good, quite natural for running. So I was running for a half an  hour. Came later, had some philosophical insights, I even wandered what  the heck with this world is happening. Like, men and women are lost  tongues to each others — they couldn't either trust, no believe. Also,  I'd add that there are a lot of evil in our world nowadays, especially  known that most of people are grown in the broken families. When MDMA  kicks in I say ""screw to all ununderstandings behind me and my parents""  and I came to the to speak. I just said honeslty, that I ingested  something, making statements that it was used by Shulgins in  psychotherapy. I can easily say, that if you're honest to your parents —  they would take you whatever you are. I remember how I was utmostly  inebrieated by lots of alcohol and parents did their great job — helped  to cleanse me and wash me. Sorry, for such a dirty story, but parents  will take you as you are in whatever state you are. I recommend to  everyone build up such relationships, like saying them that better to  love, than to be afraid. I understood during this trip that fear is an  enemy of love. And it's quite logical. For example: you fear of  rejection, right? Understand a vice-versa situation without rejection  and with good outcomes. Hard? That's right!When  you transform your loved ones — parents, etc, into those who trust you  and love — their fear will be gone. Remove all the fears, because fears  destroy your ways to peace and love. If you want to love somebody —  start from loving yourself, switching further to loving others. I also  always wanted to have a woman who loves me. But how I was wrong! It's  just an egoistical urge to be loved, not love the others. You have to  love other the first, but remembering yourself also. During the trip I  was a bit confused about my family, how it was broken long ago and how  my father cannot even describe his love, saying that I'm like a girl,  speakling girlish nonsense. Ironically and the same moment sadly, but in  his family almost all men have problems with hearts, like heart  problems, etc, etc. You know, it's not strange to see heart problems  with the same problems in the emotional sphere. They are good fathers,  still they are cold. I saw all of his brothers and other family members.  Everyone, who reads this message: please, be loveful, because without  love, with this cruelty not only the person suffers, but also the other  people, surrounding him. To love is an art — which should be studied,  like philophilia (Greek routes combined; if everything goes right — I  would write a book about that). We shall love each other if we are to  live. Modern system exchanges love on sex, but sex is not love, sex is  just physical sensations. You can partake in carnal pleasure with your  emptified heart of any longing feelings. My lifestyle is the following:  I'm a  vegan, nofapper, practice no sex lifestyle (but if I'd find a  proper woman — I'd want to have children with her, I have to make a  great family — what my fathers have problems with). You know, my parents  are against drugs, but yesterday, when my mommy and granny saw MDMA  influence on me... they were quite shocked or even surprised. They  cannot wonder that such a drug can do such an intense reaction to it.I  want to also add, that drug feels extremely potent and powerful indeed  in the route of seminal retention and lack of sexual activity. Sorry,  but when you practice lust on the daily basis — your trips are less  intense, that they are should to be. Try to be vegan, nofap/nosex — and  you'll see difference. Also, while on MDMA I didn't want to have any  dirty thing to be seen or participated in. Also, I used heroin prior to  MDMA — later heroin was just overblown by MDMA, so if someone wants to  try to combine them together — I recommend to do it different, than I  did. MDMA needs approximately an hour to an hour and a half an hour to  kick in, so possibly it is good to ingest heroin at 1-1,5 hours mark. I  was felt a bit of nodding while coming up of MDMA, but it was not too  serious, honestly. 30 minutes insufflation before oral route of MDMA is a  safe combination, still, you can try the other one. I've heard also,  that people say that heroin and opioids diminish effects of MDMA. I  haven't experienced any dimination of the effects of MDMA, I'd say its  effects were overpowered by MDMA. So, the enthustiastic-proven people  I'd recommend to try another combo, with later heroin insufflation. I'd  have done so, but sorry, now have to wait at least 2-3 months, because  such a gem should be used rarely, because it's like a spiritual crutch  for those, who have problems in finding the ways to live or of living at  all. I recommend to use MDMA just for opening up of your heart. Believe  me, it's hard, especially in our modern-day Babylon, where people tend  to be cruel, violent, even aggressive. It's a great gift of  vulnerability, because when you open your heart — you'll become  vulnerable, but what the power is. In our recent days we need more love,  because it is the thing that should be shared with others. Like the  Beatles sang — ""All you need is love"", ""all you need is love"". Also,  during the trip I listened that beautiful track: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3OPOYG6XIQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3OPOYG6XIQ).  Also, now I really want to once again make a great music library,  because there are lots of tracks. even hidden once, which are great to  be used while tripping. I don't know for now, but MDMA went quite good.  People, love each other. The great human characteristics are humane,  i.e. to be like a human. Believe — we're different — in colours, in  races, peoples, views — but we're one. We have to help each other in  order to live like real humanity, not a those ravaged savages, ignorant  to anything beautiful. Become beauty yourself, merge with it like you're  whole. People, I believe in you, sow love and rip love flowers. We need  more love. If you take MDMA — please, open up your feeling towards your  parents, with love words, saying they should trust you, because it's  your journey to see something new, reaching something important and to  just close the errors, done by predecessors.Hope  this trip report will help you. I was laying with my parents, I hugged  them a lot, like I really love them. I wanted to cry from happiness, but  MDMA can't give me such an ideation. Sadly, but I wanted to cry from  happiness. I'm happy, people. Be happy with me, please. Let the world  becomes better with our hands unite! Thanks for listening, have a good  day! https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ap975n/snorted\_heroin\_30\_minutes\_ago\_ingested\_mdma\_6/"
none,"Hi /drugs. What are the real threats of heroin use, except addiction and overdose? Recently I found out that I feel a bit of sick, like I'm intoxicated, but not in the same sense, like when I used MDMA or speed. What are real concerns, which should be looked into? I just want to take all cons and pros about heroin and quit it later. I also still use it because I wanted to test it with MDMA, that's all. As for me it was quite an interesting spiritually awakening drug, but for now it's started to fade away. So, soon I'll quit. I tried speedball, tried smoke pot with it, tried to just understand some things under it. One more wish of an opioid realm for me is to smoke some opium, like it was places, where you can smoke opium. I guess, opioid carousel should be ended with kings like morphine, which is smoked via opium substrate. I remember also in the past, when psychonauts said, that opioids can't give you some grasp to take or to comprehend. They can indeed grant something to you, if you be gentle to it. I have never used syringes, just careful user, that's all. As a heroin neophite I yearn for advices about mixes with heroin. What should I mix with it, apart from MDMA? Do not mention coke, because I'm not into that blow boat. Btw, has anyone really tried to smoke opium? I guess it will be a cool thing to have, some opium pipe, like a legendary item, from the Opium wars in the Chine. Maybe, there is some documentary about this opium culture? It will be pleasure to speak with anyone of you, I ssek some speaking, so be my guest here."
none,"Suppose, you have to sober up, thus making yourself sober from heroin or other opioid caused nod. What would you do? What type of drug or anything would you do? I'm now exmperimenting and the 5 cup of strong cocoa is still keeping me in the realm of nod. Sorry, question may be seem a bit of ""weird"", but who knows, maybe some redditor by some chance would require this topic for some extra situation. I'll finish up my 100 g cocoa pack and see if I feel sober enough."
none,"Hi /drugs. I've come to necessity to develop empathy just to become a greater person, than I am now. Is it useful to use 2c-b for seeing events, i.e. videos like animals archieving freedom, people loving each other, creating bonds, etc, etc. I mean to use 2c-b and at the same time use some kind videos to develop empathetic tendencies overall. I'm just a theoretical supposer, that's why I asked this. Knowing 2c-b is not that strong, like MDMA or LSD — is it effective for my efforts? I just heretofore was quite un-empathetic human, but now I wanna change. I was poisoned by misanthropy fumes, from which I'm now detoxifying. I think, that thing I supposed afore — should be useful in some way, still I wonder, how can I get rid of misanthropic tendencies of my past? I know that ""this part"" holds me back to my past, but I want to become better, brighter and good to people. I guess, no one shall suffer from this things. I honestly want become better, but sometimes it's hard to go on further, because something like a closed path for now. Like I need some key. Can you help me with some advice, dear /drugs? What do you think about my test with 2c-b? Thanks for listening."
none,"Hi /vegan. Have come here to just share one interesting quote from the Bible.  **""For every one that useth milk** ***is*** **unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.""** Hebrews 5:13Remember a child of that age? One who tries to say his first words? If supposing, that adults become babes by using milk is quite symbolic, isn't it? I guess, this short quote gives lots of things to think about. Thanks for listening."
none,"Hi /drugs. Has anyone tried this mix? Is it worth it? I'd suppose to say that it should some kind of ""flips"". Here I've found a code name ""moonstone"" for mixing of heroin and MDMA. [https://behavenet.com/combination/heroin-mdma](https://behavenet.com/combination/heroin-mdma) Is it worth it? What do you think? If it is a good thing — I'd rather try it some time."
none,"Hi /drugs. I come straight up to the question. I snorted nearly 60 mg of pure heroin (have tolerance) and later started feeling an absolute bliss, even love to all the living. In the light of aforesaid, what if I add some amount of MDMA? Will my experience be intensely all-loving and forgiving? Has anyone mixed some heroin with MDMA? Is it worth it?Edit: I have a feeling like an urge to hug somebody. I wanna to love my woman wholeheartedly with a beautiful and touchy understanding, that she waits for me at home. Like I'm a gem for her, which is important. L:ike without me she is lack of something important. Like I'm her man, who will keep her safe and defend her. Like a man, who is a professor for his family, like a good, all-understanding husband for such a miracleous wife. And with our existense we are a living proof rhat a love between a man and a woman such a wonderful and powerful joy, which makes happy these people and people around them. Like a brilliance aura, which affect others, making them wanting to be better."
none,"Hi /vegan. I was having a little bit of fun and caught a wonderful thought. What if there is some kind of temperament traits, like from psychology realm, but a food oriented traits? Like if you eat meat — you seem to be aggressive, violent, etc, etc, if you vegetarian — you have some other temperament, if you vegan — you have alsom something, up to fruitarian temperament. What do you think? It's like some kind of frequency of a human, from the lowest to the highest one. For me, it sounds like a development of the human, like from child to the old man or woman. What do you think?P.s.: I'm a bit of sleepy, so no wonder why some words sound a bit ""foggy""."
none,"Hi /decaf. I try to explain, what I've been feeling up to day. First day I felt quite irritated, confused and a bit of pissed off with anxiety and phobic tendencies. Second day was almost the same, but a bit of weaker, than the first day. Third day is easier, but experienced sleep deprivation, like felt insomni(a)-ous. Since the fourth day I've been experiencing tranquility, peaceful with joie-de-vivre feeling. Oddly, but the state of mind without caffeine seems quite natural and interesting. Like I have no need to hurry, do things without any tension and the feeling that someone punches me to do the thing. Also, I marked that dreams are so vivid and interesting, that I'm happy to watch dreams during my peaceful slumber. Maybe, I'll do some new post in some time, like a month later or something. Will see. Hope, you enjoyed reading this. Good luck!"
none,"Hi /nofap. Recently have come to understanding, that a life without porn and masturbation is like a new born identity: firstly, remembering the past is like a fog, where I don't understand how I acted like that, secondly — the past seems to be like the place, where everything was ""weird"", like it was not me, but someone else. I don't know exactly, but if it looks so — a life without any lust and pornography seems to be something new, but should be a real thing, from the birth of any human. Also, I think if a person starts nofap — he or she will understand, that they lost some time of their lives, doing something, but in the fog, caused lust. It's like it was you, but like an alien ""you"". I have heard and read lots of stories, where people say that they feel better on nofap and also say how in the past they were mocked by others, even marked impotents, gays or something like that. I wonder, if masturbation makes a person something different, apart from his or her real nature, what is the real nature indeed? I know, that masturbation is a complex problem. After quitting it there are lots of problems, which surround masturbation itself. So, my question is following: has your life changed all-together, when you started nofap? Why I ask this, because I feel it is a life-changing experience. Oddly though, but we seem to be on nofap thing, because it's a natural thing, made by nature, like a part of a human development. I wonder, what nofap has given you, apart from good feeling? Describe you experience, if you want it. I found out, also, that when you relapse — you, like, start understand everything from the beginning, like relapse takes you back, like the second time you at the same class. Like, you should re-learn the topic. Like an exam on a nofap thematic. What we really are, if take away any lustful description, showed to us via such social media? If you lustful — you see the world via lustful eyes. If you are humane — you act like a human, just a logic. What we really are? Any thoughts on this topic would be highly appreciated."
none,"Hi, I have some specific question. Have you ever tried using drugs and run? For example, I tried to run on weed and find it a bit distracting, unfocused, still funny and sometimes quite good, depends on strain of weed. I tried to run on tramadol and it was quite good as a cup of tea or coffee. I found that running on any caffeine is quite a good thing, like after you get increased amounts of pleasure. I tried to run on 2c-b and it was some kind of cool, but any lack of pleasure of running. On heroin it was a cool thing to do, but just ok. I never tried to run on amphetamines, because I've heard that it's too complicated for heart muscles. Is it really dangerous to run on amphetamines? I always feared to do this, is this a true concern? I just remember that, when I started used amphetamines I forgot about running, exactly about this cardiovascular concern. What do you think about running high? Is amphetamine really dangerous to take for high running?"
none,"Is it a good combination? What do you think? For example, like scag with acid or scag with shrooms. Is it good? I'm just inerested in experiences of others."
none,"I'm interested whether is here, in this sub, any man or woman who tried drugs, experimented a bit and quitted a bit later? I mean, that this person didn't sing praises to drugs in any form or word? Is there some?"
none,"Hi. I just wanted to ask, if all amphetamine fun sooner or  later subsides. I remember a month ago I was like high-five man, with fun, lots of thoughts, etc, etc. And now these amphetamine times are become weird and anxiety-provocing (but after psychological high). All amphetamines end the same, right? Fun, okay fun, less fun, almost no fun at all, right? Like in that link on bluelight, where it was properly described five or something like that stages of amphetamine fun. Now I'm some kind of anhedonic, even games are lack of pleasure. Time to quit amphetamine, right?Edit: [http://forum.quittingadderall.com/forums/topic/879-8-stages-of-amphetamine-useabuse/](http://forum.quittingadderall.com/forums/topic/879-8-stages-of-amphetamine-useabuse/) speaking of those stages, I think I'm at 4 or 5, like I'm not willing to do anything, like I don't know what to do and just lots of laziness and a wish to sleep for more."
none,"Hi /drugs. Is this thing is quit common, while quitting opioids? I just saw physical think like problems with sleep, muscle aches or something like that, sweating, flu-like thing, paranoia, depression. But what about motivation to do something? I have almost no interest in doing anything. Even playing in games doesn't give enough of pleasure. Is it the main phase, where you can relapse? I even have no idea what to do for now, even at home I don't wanna do anything. So, is there any need for worrying?"
none,"Hi /drugs. I've typed already about heroin withdrwawal a week ago. Now I think that tramadol a bit harsh, I even have a feeling that tramadol should be used (if need to be used) in the manner like of ecstasy. Why? Because, it reminds me a bit of feelings of MDMA, but in a bit of a different manner, still with empathy, though. So, after stopping using of heroin I used tramadol as an aid to get rid of withdrawal symptoms. I started feeling better, but now, after tramadol ended, I feel like I have some muscle cramps or some weak ache, a bit uncomfortable. I have also the feeling that I would have quitted heroin with some gaba stuff like xanax or phenibut, i.e. a bit safer, than if I used tramadol. Maybe, it would be the best decisioin, because during that heroin withdrawal I just experienced some kind of strong anxiety and paranoia, while getting some tramadol. If you're gonna use tramadol — use prolonged version, which duration is approximately 10 hours. So, today I'm sleepy, without tramadol, like even lots of caffeine can't help me. I have an idea to use some speed. So, now I don't if it was a good idea to use tramadol as an idea to quit, still, I guess, some can get benefits, because it indeed eases heroin withdrawal. But when comes to quitting tramadol, it makes a bit things harsher, than of heroin, because tramadol can make you moody. After heroin withdrawal I understood that the ""heroin honeymoon"" ended after the 1st gramm, later turning into more nod, less euphoria. And I used by an insufflation route nearly 2 gramms of heroin. To the 2nd gramm I started to experience more anxiety, that I started understanding, that I gotta quit — and now I've finished. Still, the mellow aroma of that heroin high, especially on amphetamine comedowns... I liked that period. It was cool, especially in the atmosphere of searching some answers and writing some peace of information. Also, I wanted to quit because I started experiencing more problems with constipation, like it's hard to even defecate. In my region some call tramadol as an opioid ecstasy. I guess, partially, it is and should be treated in this matter, because tramadol magic also fades. I remember how I used tramadol in the summer 2018 — it was quite magnificent, but to the end it made me anxious and empty. The same is here, I feel like squizzed like a lemon, or something like that. A bit of groggy and weak. I guess, some tramadol users will say the same thing, as I've done. I guess, this wall of text can be interesting for some. Thanks for listening."
none,"Hi /decaf. I've come here to wonder about the positive consequences of quitting caffeine. Recently I've found out, that I became irritable, aggressive and at some situation even anxious. Still, on the third day of caffeine-free lifestyile I experience relaxed state of mind and in the body. I'm wondering, how those, who, for instance, maintain this lifestyle for a half a year, or entire year, feel. Has your life changed in lots of things? Thanks for your attention."
none,"Hi /vegan. Everytime I start to dive into vegan lifestyle — I see that it reveals me existing emptiness in myself. Like food suppressed all my emptiness, animal food so to speak. Has anyone experienced something like this, feeling of emptiness on vegan lifestyle? Also, has a feeling like what I did in the past was just acts of ignorance, without proper knowledge. Now I won't act like this. Also, I remember when I was a furious meateater and mocked vegetarians and vegans, but now I understand that vegetarians were half-right, vegans are right. I guess even behavior is changed, since transition to veganism. I wonder to know if someone experienced life rebuilding understanding and doing. Under life-rebuilding I mean to change life, like to move further, into the future with a new way of life and getting rid of unnecessary things of the past, that ties you to the past or something like that. Thanks for listening! Any reply would be useful!"
none,"Hi, I just a bit of stoned and under that hazy smog I just thought — how can this be? Was it me? I just weirdly feel that I did something wrong in the past, or just something from the past... now it sounds like it was something... not mine. Like it's hard to agree that it was actually me. Someone experienced something like that? Like the past is distant, and it's not yours. Now I even don't know, who is really me? Like I had something in reality, but it was like ""a sleep experience"", like I in the past was something not ""really me"", that's is real one in the ""now moment"". Remember the movie, ""Peaceful warrior""? There was a scene in the clocktower, where collided ""the old self"" and ""the new self"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsbtKKHnUSI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsbtKKHnUSI)? Something like this."
none,"Hi, fellow weedeaters. I just wanted asked one question: has anyone of you tried to do some vegan ""weed drink"" (I don't know how it's called, but the main thing is to use some milk with weed and boil it in a cooker). I've heard that there are a lot of types of milks — almond mink, soy milk, etc, etc. That's why I ask if it is suitable to replace common cow milk with almond milk, for example. Is it a work scenario? "
none,"Hi /drugs. I came here to share a good movie, **""Street cat named Bob"", 2016**. It's about a man who are steadfast in his attempt to quit heroin and methadone. During his tries a cat visits him, later said by some woman that ""cat coming is not a coincidence"", like cat came to those who need it. I highly (pun unintended) recommend to watch this movie just to inspire those who are strong at the aims of quitting heroin altogether and hopefully forever. Hope, this will be interesting for you. I just re-warched this film and later, altruistically I wanted to share it with you. Maybe, it will help some of you. Have fun and good luck on your quitting! Peace!"
none,"Hi /drugs. I wonder if it is the common thing to experience nightmares or some kind of anxiety during sleep. I also experienced this night some nyctophobia, like something in the dark. Has anyone experienced something akin to my thing? Thanks for your attention."
none,"Hi, dear /drugs. First of all, I'm quitting heroin and using tramadol as a temporary replacement. Feel good, thanks. I come straight to my observation. When I use tramadol alone, without caffeine — I feel like full-blown effects of tramadol, like SNRI and opioid activity. But when I ingested two cups of strong green tea — I started to experience more nodding, like I'm in reality and at the same time experience ""sleepily awakened"". I wanted to say, that opioid effect is stronger, when I ingested caffeinated beverage like green tea, like it changed a whole direction of the high into more opioid wake. Sometimes, when I used tramadol in the past I remember some kind of stimulation, like I wanted to do things with a nod sensation. With green tea I do things like I'm almost sleepy, like a state before falling into dreams or something like that. Not in the sleep and not fully awakened. I typed it down in case if somebody finds it interesting. Also, if I'm not mistaken, I saw some paper, that states that caffeine and tramadol work synergistically, but with the emphasis on increased opioid effect by tramadol, enhanced by caffeine. Thanks for listening!"
none,"Hi. Recently I found out, that I awake during sleep with fear, especially fear of respiratory depression with intense tachycardia. Has anyone experienced something like that? Even yesterday, when I used tramadol as an aid to ease off heroin withdrawal symptoms — I woke up with anxiety among sleep. It's weird, still I wonder, why is that happening? Why? Has anyone delve into this topic? Thanks for listening."
none,"Hi. I go into detail and describe it: I did three lines of amphetamine for a 12 hour period. After the last line I started to sneeze, several times. Later, when it came to comedown, started experience dysphoria with snot from my nostrils. Also, after I got rid of snot — I saw like the skin across my nostrils started to peel off, or something like that. I have a feeling that, this amphetamine had some dirty additives, that caused irritation to my nose and nostrils. What substances can cause such an irritation? I just wonder, what can cause it? Because I remember, when I used the same amphetamine, but from the other vendor — I had no problems: everything comes and goes quite easy. I have a feeling, that this amphetamine is quite acidic or have some compound, that erodes my nostrils, making the skin across nostrils peel off quite a bit. What's your opinion? I guess, people sometimes collide with amphetamine or other substance impurities. Thanks for listening!"
none,"Hi, dear /drugs. Occasionally, I experience some nasal congestion due to insufflation of some substances, like speed or heroin. Hence, arises the question: how do you deal with nasal congestion? As for me, the most proper answer here is to spend some time sober (what I want actually to do). But what if it is necessary to get rid of nasal congestion? Speaking metaphysically with the sauce of theology, I can say that nose says ""stop insufflation procedures"". But I don't like to be feeling like I'm ill, because after amphetamine usage \~ 100-150 mg, separated in two or three doses, the following day and the day after the following one — I can experience the aforementioned problem. How do you deal with it? Please don't say, that I have to get some breaks, because I'm going to do so, i.e. I found something that I want to pursue to. What if I sniff some black pepper, will it work? Technically, it can help, but I came here to listen to opinions of those who had this problems. Also, I'd add that some knowledge is not written in books, but understood through self-experimentation. Thanks for listening!Edit: after jogging for almost 30 minutes on cold weather (-10) my nose opened up, still though, I think it is necessary to do some more physical exercise outdoors."
none,"Hi. I binged with heroin for 8 hours, 3 doses. An hour ago I started feeling nausea, like heartburn. I used my two fingers later to puke and I saw that everything I ate for the last 10 hours are not digested and stayed all the way from my mouth to stomach. Still, after puking I feel a bit burning sensation in my throat. My question is this: is heroin destroys any possibility to digest food? I feel like it's a horrendous thing. Has anyone had something like that? Any other experiences, people? Thanks for listening."
none,"Hi. I searched through internet quite a bit and tested myself some opioids and felt safe and comfortable, thus understanding that opioids act on the root chakra. Still, I have a feeling, that using some opioids can lead to depressing of the up chakras, like crown chakra, etc. What do you think about this? I just had an idea, that with using of opioids come the other thing — disbalance of sexual chakra. I want to hear opinions of other, more profound people in this topic. If you know some interesting books on this topics — I'd be greatful to hear about them. I'm a new one here and want to know more about those things. But here I came with some particular question. Thanks for listening!"
none,"Hi. Imagine that you have a task to create a proper medical kit for yourself for any case to be prepared, like the proverb ""forewarned is forearmed"" states. Coming to the painkiller part, apart from ibuprofen, ketorolac, there should be some opioid medication. What medication would you choose? As for myself, in my area the easiest drug that you can obtain are heroin, buprenorphine, methadone and tramadol, so my choice is quite poor, but what's yours? What would you choose, knowing your particular situation? If you have the same situation as mine, what substance would you choose? I always wanted to have some medical kit for some probable situation. Because no one knows, what will be further in our lives. Thanks for your attention!"
none,"Is there any necessity or interest in mixing of different opioids? I've heard about some, who mixed heroin with tramadol, etc, etc. Also, is it good to use antihistamines while on opioids? Is it safe? Knowing it, antihistamines are sedating, that's why I have a feeling that it's dangerous. Who has ever mixed different opioids? Is there any good thing in this or just a terrible dissappointment or problems with respiratory depression? I'm just curious, that's why I'm asking. Also, interesting to hear experiences of others. More practical approach I'm interested in. So, I'd be grateful to read some experiences. Thanks for listening!"
none,"Hi there, I'm new here. Just wonder, is your dreams become more vivid and interesting, when you sleep strictly, starting from the beginning of circadian rhythms cycle, i.e. 21:00 (or earlier) up to 4-6 o'clock in the morning? I just wonder about anecdotal views to understand perfectly, if it really fits and beneficial in some way. The question based on my interest in dreams as a whole thing, because I see it as a way of learning about myself, even possibly predicting something, because I've heard dreams sometimes have these tendencies. Will my life change whole entirely, if I practice early awakening and early departuring to sleep (I see sleep as a travelling to other planes, that's why I used this word). Thanks for listening. I'd greatly appreciate any reply here."
none,"Hi there. I come straightforward to question. Disclaimer: please, don't say things like ""blah-blah-blah it's bad"", ""beware of dangerous things, addiction"", etc — I know it. I was curious and tried it. So, no blame on me. Like an experimentator I did it just to understand what is it about.  I tried some heroin lately, saw this euphoria all users speak about, but at the same time I see some disgustful side effect — I can't shit! I fart throughtout the night, without any possibility to defecate with some itching. No IV, no IM, only snorting. How can you do H frequently? I just started to feel a bit of boredom from doing it (I tried the second day). How do you it? I just have an idea, that it can be useful on stimulant comedowns, for bettering sleep quality and for easing from pain. Yeah, it can get rid of anxiety, feeling calm and peaceful. Had some insights while on it, useful I'd say, that's all. I can't say that it's not that good or bad, but something's missing here. Like I'm a bit disappointed. How this thing became a cult? I just wonder how? Explain me the things I don't know. Please, if you want to talk — be friendly, I don't want to say foul things or something. I just want to see real honest talk, that's all.Speaking about withdrawals: I have a thought, that all your feeling sick after one's attempt to quit it is just from the shit, you stored in oneself throughout heroin bingeing. No wonder, that comes later vomitting, shitting, etc, etc. I think the main symptoms of withdrawal come from this thing. No offence, really, but it's logical.P.s.: how can I shit while on H?Thanks for listening!"
none,"Hi. I've made some experiments on myself and found out that caffeine makes me incredibly horny, so it can make you easier to relapse. The other one was to use some amphetamine, later finding that it's harder for me to relapse while on amphetamine. Knowing that caffeine is everywhere, I came to conclusion that it's the main trend to maintain people horny, like some lustful sub-animals. I wonder, how can this be, that illegal thing makes me less horny, than the legal thing? I have some thoughts on this, like anxiety, horniness and relapses have something in common in-between. I suppose, lust is based upon anxiety or something like that. What is remarkable is amphetamine makes me more sober and conscious about what I'm doing, while caffeine makes me doing stupid things, like obsessing googling throught the internet or social webs, which are, you know, like a living on the island, where is some sleeping volcano (under sleeping volcano I mean some profile, which in concordance with ingesting caffeine can lead you to relapse). I even came to conclusion, that all legal drugs are suppossed to be like this, trapping you in this lustful circle, or dumbing you down.**P.s.: my opinion is subjective, so I don't want to prove you anything. I just share my thoughts, which can be useful for some, or may be a bit interesting.** "
none,"Hi. I'm suffering from tanatophobia, i.e. fear to live. I've heard about LSD experiences, that if you use it properly and in the right setting — it will bring lots of good things. Also, I've heard about ego death thing, than you let it go, to just feel the world itself, unconditionally. My question is: can LSD help me to deal with my fears? Like to be reborn? I'm tired of this existing, not living. I exist, not live. Can it help? Is it safe to go into the forest, while on LSD? I tried in the past 2c-b, MDMA, still, as for me, they were not so deep, as I needed. Shrooms are good, still don't know for now. Any opinions?"
none,"I just had an idea of trying some day some wormwood, gathered in the beginning of the autumn. I did a little bit of it, smoking via bong. And now I have a bit of sedative feeling. Is it the effect of the wormwood iself? Like I'm here, sedated a little bit, music sounds better. I'm new here. Thanks for listening, I'd like to hear others' experiences."
none,"Relapsed. What I did beforehand? I had a hobby, had a job, had some talk. Still, it doesn't fullfill me. People? Recently I saw that most of people I know — doesn't understand me, like we speak in other languages. Friendship with others are one-sided, like they don't give a shit about me. Had no love in the childhood, have tendencies to drugs, alcohol and videogames with PMO. Women? I don't know how to deal with them, honestly. I just talk like a human, nothing else. I was raised in the beginning by the full family, but later I continued raising by mom and grandmother. Sometimes I feel depression, anxiety. Mom and granny sometimes even make me anxious, fearful. I don't know, what to do, where to go. What else? No success. I'm fucking man without any success in this life. I have some knowledge and notes, which don't make me happy. Women? People? All my friends were fake, all my women were just a manipulative beings. How can I live in this world with this shitload of problems? I have no friends, no love from parents. I wanna to love people and help them, but no one even gives a shit about me. In this moment I wish that this world will be submerged into the deep sea, just to take note to me, like I'm exist. Even while working I had a feeling that ""don't want to help my people, country, etc, etc"", even had the darkest ones like to change the sides — into evil one. Like helping bankers like Rothschild, Rockefeller and others to make people worse. I also tried to love my parents, but I can't. They don't love me. Like I'm nothing. They are look cold-hearted. About success I wish I could have started some things earlier. And now I looks like some retard, who have no money, no job, nothing. Like my essence called life is evaporating slowly. Sorry for such an egocentrical post, but I don't know how to be in this situation, filled with pain. Sometimes even I have a feeling that I'm unwanted in this world. Still, I can't commit suicide — I'm a coward. See, how my life is pathetic? I even don't know what I want from life! I wanna cry and scream, however no one will hear my voice. In these dark moments I start to think about some drugs, like heroin, because nothing helps me. People say, nofap is a cool thing and it works, superpowers, etc, etc. Yes, for some maybe, who are loved by parents at least. Today in the night I watched porn for 10 hours. 10! I don't know, how you all people overcome all this shit, I don't know. I don't know, how you date with someone, have friends. It's all like a bleak thing for me now. Sometimes even I'm not interested in speaking with a new friends, just no interest, total nonchalance. People say about success... how they do this? Am I that broken that I can't change myself or cursed by something or someone? Seems like I try to move, but everyone people say politely ""fuck you"". I wrote an article, but a man said that ""it's not scientific"", I tried to say to man to start some reggie band, and he said ""you have nothing in music done"", however I can sing. Job? I worked for 6 days and said to me ""fuck it"". While working temporarily as a courier, I marked lots of women looked at me with some interest. Still, I run from them, like I'm afraid of them (feeling anxious, a bit sweaty palms). Yeah, some kind of gynecophobia, unfortunately. Sometimes even social phobia arises, if I drink caffeine or some animal based food. I wanna run from my house, but nowhere, because I know I can't for now do this. And how to live? I see problems, but I cannot solve some of them, because parents' love can give only parent himself. I even stopped parents called mother and father in the past, don't know why. And I'm a bit of uncomfortable to call them this. As far as I remember, also, I never felt like it is my house, where I'm safe. Even had a thought in the past, like my mother is not mine — something distant, like a human being, but so far from me, not sure even if it's a relative. Sometimes, even if I move forward — I experience fear and I go back. It's hard to go somewhere further, knowing that you can rely only on yourself. I tried to help my parents and relatives, but they don't want to hear me. And I feel like I'm nothingness for them. Hence, also, no will even to will, to live, to fight. I had lots of plans, but this carcass of depression and anxiety holds me back into the past. I just say all of this, because I have no friends, no one: I don't want to speak about all of this with relatives. Sometimes I even have a feeling, that when I show some good qualities toward my mother and gtrandmother — they just sit onto my neck, drinking my blood energetically. In the past, amidst some passionate anger I even had very dirty words in my head — to get rid of their annoyance (I understand, that it's bad, I know). However, how can a man like me live in this world, if you want to share with people kindness, to see their smiles and do something, but reality shows only the things like indifference to me, mockery from some, words from surrounding like an ""odd man"", ""strange man"" or something like this? I don't know how to do it, to feel better. From the beginning of my life people tend to make me bad in any sense. Thus, feeling of hearbrokenness overall. Even in the childhood I was deprived of any love from parents: they worked all day, even no one said, that they loved me. They don't even pronounce a word ""love"", they just live, eating lots of tasty foods, later delving into gluttony. Some of them even can't or afraid of showing his love. I don't know, how to be, when the world itself shows its coldness. Am I the bad person, who shall be deprived of all of this? I can't go further without any support. It's like lack of oxygen. Even work, hobbies and any other thing don't make me happy. I write notes, understand knowledge, but it looks like without any sense, what for. It's like you're the one, who should suffer. In these moments even drugs can't help. No drug. Because you can't run away from this. I don't know. Maybe I'm terribly feminised or some program in my head is broken — I don't know. I even cried from the pain I hardly even can bear. Like, hopelessness closed your eyes to see anything else, except this pain. Like some little child, which was thrown away, like my vivid, light heart-driven worldviewing was injured by something, making me like an offended child. I had pure heartful wishes to help people, humanity, however this pain and problems get me back, like don't allow me to do this. I know, that doing better — you'll better the world. However, oftentimes people say I'm wrong, etc, etc, like ""it's not true"", etc, etc. Sometimes even I have a feeling, that I don't want to burden someone, including possible loved ones, however, deep inside I know, that I can hurt this particular woman by neglecting her. That's why I'm hiding, also. I hurted lots of pain to other people, that's why I said to myself to stop hurt others. Broken hearts, hopes, even friendships.Also, I'm writing this, because I have nothing to lose. Technically, I can even shoot myself and no one will care from any of my acquaintances. Even world will be the same, nothing will change even from my perdition. While there is some particular state of mind, I can say almost everything, like my head almost cut off by an executioner.  I'm not sure, that even someone will be reading this. Practically, it can be a perfect example of what is hidden behind PMO or drug addictions. Also, I'd add that my state also is described by some remarkable post-punk album, ""Unknown pleasures"" by Joy Division, some song excerpt even with the meaning ""directionless so plain to see, the loaded gun won't set you free..."", etc, etc. Also, message to the parents — love your children and children will love you, otherwise they'll be some problematic child with various different complexes, caused by dysfunctional family. Thanks for the presumptive reading of this wall of text. Hope, your journey will be softer, than mine. Good luck and have fun!"
none,"Hi. Recently I came to conclusion, that I can't go back and at the same moment I don't know where to go and what goal to archieve. Sometimes it's quite hard to go further, because knowing the years spent on pornography, I just found out that I lost a lot of useful time to become better or to reach something. I'm jealous about others' successes. While I was obsessed with pornography, others tried to reach something — poetry, music, etc, etc. Still, though, all people I know or knew — they started early, than I, on their journey through their lives. I'm confused, because I feel like ""the train has gone"", still though I wanted to do lots of things — the moment, which quite deplorable to comprehend. How do you, profound sages of nofap and strong bone(r) warriors of nofap overcome those things? I came to you as an apprentice, to understand more deeper the nofap art. I just found myself a bit lost and confused about all these lost years. Like what a stupid I was to do such a thing. Sometimes, also, when I see others' success I feel like I'm worthless or something like that and at the same time jealous. When I saw a good man, but millionaire, I felt the same, jealous. How do you deal with this? Help me if you can, brothers of nofap, with you good and warm advice. Thank you for listening."
none,"My opinion is quite subjective, so no worry about any objectification. I'd like to share my experiences with videogames. I was a game junkie since my 10-15 years. I remember I wanted to become a progamer, still I haven't reached that goal, because the game started to decline. I speak about Starcraft. Later, in the 2015, and now I've found out, that I just changed my reality for the virtual one. I mean, I ran from my problems for my entire life. Even my bad behavior, anxiety — it was arisen because of games, running from reality. It's the same like porn — it changes you in some ways, can even lead to something bad. Games can be entertaining and useful. I can't say that games can be entirely bad, it's not objective. They can show you something and you can learn from it. But for me it was a crucial thing, taking part in everything in my life to be broken and abandoned. I have problems in my family, but I haven't done anything. Sometimes reality can be tough and it's an honest answer. Still, reality grants more opportunities to us, than any other imaginary world, because virtual worlds have some limits. For me it's like voluntary deception. For me Starcraft just inhibited my further development, from the spiritual point of view. Like some thing, something was taken on my head, like a hat, which stopped me from any further spiritual enlightenment. Still, it was fun. Real fun. But after even 1 or 2 days of gaming I see that reality became alien to me. Like, I live, but reality seems to be not real. I guess, it's just our choices, when we change our reality by replacing it with the virtual one, where everything is predictable and you know what to wait for. Real life grants you more things. Harder to predict something, though possible to see them by doing a ""reap-what-you-sow principle"". Even relationships for me became bleak, when I was a hardcore gamer. So, for me it's a necessity to get rid of games. Hope, my experience can be helpful.Tl;dr: gaming may have some problems behind, which disrupts your healthy life. Sometimes, real life is replaced by virtual one. Games can be either helpful or detrimental, depending on the person.Thanks for listening, have fun!"
none,"Hi. While walking through the forest I've got some idea about using MDMA in the family occurrence. I mean, is it a good idea to use MDMA all family at the same moment? I just found out that some of my family has emotional problems, like problems of showing love, compassion, etc, etc. The idea looks good, however I'm interested, maybe someone else tried this? To me using MDMA looks like an easy way to get into your suppressed emotions, to release emotions. Looks also, like someone was restricted to show one's emotions. But. appealing to logical sense, if someone suppresses all his life emotions, it will follow to the emotional outbreak or something else. So, has anyone tried something like this? Ideally, it really can help, but practically I don't know, still it is possible. Thanks for listening!"

none,"I understand that flualprazolam bars (which I've been taking for months and I've got a super high tolerance to benzos in general) Are stronger than your standard alprazolam.But can anybody give me accurate conversion rates? Like for example 10 of x is roughly equal to 15 of y.I found the recommended doses on google snd supposedly 1-2 msg flualp I'd a very heavy dose but to me it does fuck all. I usually start getting drowsy if I don't drink any energy drinks and take 10-15 at once. That's how high my tolerance is.But please give me a alp to flualp conversion rate, doesn't have to be exactly right but as long as it's close enough to the truth I'll take it. Thanks."
none,"The example I'm going to use is Nasal spray here in the UK because I've bought by now 3 supposedly different nasal spray, 2 of which say they're decongestants and 1 was for sinus-ease.The first 2 I'm going to talk about are Sudafed nasal sprays. One is slightly more expensive than the other (didn't see which one was more expensive) and they are advertised to work differently.Red Sudafed, Sinus-ease: contains the active ingredient xylometazoline hydrochloride at 0.1%w/v Blue Sudafed, Decongestant: also contains xylometazoline HCl at a concentration of 0.1%w/vNow the cheaper brand called Otrivine is advertised as a decongestant just like the blue Sudafed, but is almost half the price of blue Sudafed and guess what.Otrivine decongestant: contains active ingredient xylometazoline HCl at the same conc. 0.1% w/vSo my point is? Research the active ingredient in whatever branded product you're taking and next time you want to buy the product with the same active ingredient look around or ask a pharmacist to help you find the cheapest product which contains that active ingredient.Most of the time generic unbranded products have the same active ingredients as the branded overpriced products, but generic products tend to be WAY way cheaper.So everyone, don't be lazy, it won't take you long to find other cheaper products with the same active ingredient because it's the active ingredient that has an active effect on you.If you are struggling with money like I am but need to regularly buy some products from pharmacies (like hayfever pills, nasal spray or painkillers) don't be ashamed to ask the pharmacist to show you the cheapest product you're looking for. In the end, it's their job to help you find what's best for you and the pharmacy still makes money, they don't take any losses even if they sell at super cheap prices.Peace out."
none,"So I'm currently using mothers sorrow along with either necropotence (for sustain and my bear pet) or instead of necropotence I use julianos.I don't have the full false gods set yet, I'm still in the process of farming.Same with mantle of siroria, I'm still trying to get it.But to be honest I am currently grinding Arx Corinium to get x2 staves and x3 jewellery, to combine that with 5x light armour Mothers sorrow pieces and I am currently using x2 Magnus gift, 1x heavy and 1x medium.I have medium Slimecraw shoulders and I'm planning on grinding for the heavy helm to complete my monster set.I just wanted to ask people, who have had experience with the sets or have tried using the sets, is it worth grinding for x2 Medusa staves and 3x jewellery along with x5 mother's sorrow and x2 Magnus gift (or other magdps monster sets)?I'm mainly wanting to combine x5 Medusa with x5 MS because I'm a Breton magden dps, so my sustain is pretty decent but I'm lacking in spell critical.Also second question. Should I use the lover Mingus stone for penetration or is it not worth investing in spell penetration? Keep in mind, I'm doing only PvE none of this will be used for PvP content. If not lover mundus then I'm guessing thief/shadow. But since both Medusa and MS sets will give me plenty of spell critical, I feel using thief mundus stone would be overkill and the shadow would be more beneficial.But I'm still new to the game builds and stuff, I'm still learning and up until recently I haven't been focusing on getting proper gear but I've levelled 3 characters to level 50 to: 1. See which one of the 3 chars I chose I enjoy playing the most.2. See on which character I can get the best gear and get the highest dps3. I like to switch characters every now and then, I don't like the idea of focusing on just 1 character and building him to be OP. I don't care about being the strongest, I just want to have a fun char to play with that does decent DPS and can get decent gear quickly.P.s: my 3 chars are:high elf magicka sorcerer DPS/HealerBreton magicka warden DPS/Tankdark elf magicka night blade DPSMy personal favourite being my magden because I have gear to play as either DPS or Tank.Looking forward to hearing from people, just please don't be harsh on me as I'm new to the game (bought game in 2015 but only came back 2-3 months ago) so I'm still learning a lot of things.I've made friends with a master crafter so if there's any sets that are good for magicka builds (except for julianos as I already have it) please note it too.Many thanks."

none,"So let me start from the beginning, how it all began. I was I think around 8 years old when I discovered pornography and realised it felt good masturbating. The reason I'm mentioning this is because I feel like that's where my addiction began, because I would from the moment I discovered masturbation, I would be doing it multiple times a day, every-single-day.That lasted up until the age of 15, which is when I got introduced to weed. I didn't get addicted to weed at first, but my sex/porn addiction got the better of me and I realised it felt x100 better when you're high. So I started smoking regularly so I can have incredible orgasms. I always told myself that it's for self-medicating but I was just in denial and in addiction.So now at age 16, I've already been smoking weed id say every other day after school for a year, and all my mates started experimenting with other drugs. Mainly MDMA, LSD, cocaine, amphetamine. So by age 17 I was fully hooked on cocaine, Xanax, LSD and weed and I passed my high school exams with good grades, but after high school everything started going downhill quicker than I anticipated.I overdosed on Xanax that had opiates mixed in with it (not fentanyl, because when I went to hospital they tested my urine and opiates showed up) and since I was living with my parents they put me on house arrest and I had the worst withdrawals ever. Xanax withdrawals are just as bad if not worse than heroin withdrawals.So after a month my parents let go of the house arrest, as they drug tested me and everything came back negative (I was clean for the whole month I was under house arrest) but as soon as I got back out I went straight back into everything literally head first.I quit college at 18 in order to pursue an apprenticeship as I was more hands on and I felt trying for university was pointless since I had no drive to study from books for the next 4 years. I had no luck getting any sort of job or apprenticeship, so I got into drugs but this time it was x100 worse.I was selling all sorts of things, and I was snorting all my profit (once I paid the bills for my flat obviously)I ended up having multiple seizures due to the amount of drugs I've been taking and I got sent to rehab. Rehab would've worked well if I hadn't met my ex-girlfriend there, because dating in rehab was not allowed so as soon as we got out we started dating.I had persisting psychosis from the extensive hardcore drug use over the years so I was mentally unstable, and she was just as stable as me so the relationship was bound to fail.I was sober whilst dating her, I only took my prescribed medication no recreational drugs. But when we broke up I relapsed and everything I learned in rehab went out the window because I don't handle break ups very well.I am currently trying desperately to get clean as I've had enough of this horrible life, I hate it. But at the same time I feel like it's helping me. I know it's not helping me, but at the time you're doing drugs you don't think about that.I'm sorry for the long story, I just want people to read this and realise that drugs aren't a joke and it's not even worth experimenting because you can be like me and get addicted to anything after 1 try. Please be careful, be happy that you are healthy and have a roof over your head. You don't need drugs to be happy. They will only make you miserable.Anyways, if anybody wants to talk to me about anything or needs advice regarding abstinence, feel free to message me. I wish everyone good luck and a wonderful day. Take care!"

Cocaine: Cocaine is potentiated somewhat by alcohol because of the formation of cocaethylene. Ketamine: Ketamine and Alcohol cause ataxia and bring a very high risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. If the user falls unconscious while under the influence there is a severe risk of vomit aspiration if they are not placed in the recovery position. Psychedelics: Low risk or no risk at all.

Cannabis: Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences. Cocaine: This combination of stimulants will increase strain on the heart. It is not generally worth it as cocaine has a mild blocking effect on dopamine releasers like amphetamine. Ketamine: No unexpected interactions, though likely to increase blood pressure but not an issue with sensible doses. Psychedelics: Stimulants increase anxiety levels and the risk of thought loops which can lead to negative experiences Opioids: Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates.

Not only is it sticky, the damn thing is a wafer so I end up snorting larger chunks anyways.It burns like hell and I don't recommend it to anymore, but there is a huge difference (for me) between oral espranor and sniffing it.For some reason when I sniff it I don't get any noticeable buzz or euphoria but I start nodding off quite quickly and the whole day is drowsy as f**k.So here's some harm reduction advice: don't do it, but if you do make sure you crush it up as much as you can, spray a little mist of water up your nose before snorting, and since 8mg tablets are so big you will need to use 2 nostrils otherwise you won't be able to take it all in one nose.Please don't be an idiot like me and don't do this stupid shot just to try make my day a tad merrier.Anyhow, happy new year everyone and I hope y'all be years resolutions come true."

none,"So let me start from the beginning. I know the flair says long post but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.A couple of months ago I was addicted to Heroin, and I would usually do heroin for like a week, then once I ran out I would take a weeks break. I did this for 2 reasons: The first reason was to prove to myself that I can get through the withdrawals and the second reason was to have a tolerance break.It wasn't fun, but I wanted to show myself that I can get through the horrible withdrawals. Eventually though I had enough of this cycle and went to the local drug & alcohol clinic to get on Methadone/Buprenorphine.I asked the doctor for Methadone but he refused and gave me Buprenorphine instead. The reason I wanted Methadone was because I was already on Buprenorphine before and when I came off it I relapsed almost straight away because my mindset was if I use opioids on Subutex I'll get sick, but once I'm off them I can use again”I know this was a stupid thing to do and my mindset was completely wrong, so this time I thought if I get put on Methadone I will still be able to use on top, but that wasn't the point. The point was to learn self control so I don't use anything on top, but the doctor didn't care and still put me on Subutex.So now I go to the clinic every 2 weeks to do a urine test to prove I'm not using any other drugs on top on the Buprenorphine (like benzos, weed or cocaine) and so far I've stayed clean and only been using the Subutex.Now I have another clinic appointment and urine test on the 30th, and my birthday is on the 28th and I've already got Xanax and cocaine ready because I'm having a party.Can I refuse to do the urine test? Or say I can't get any pee out? What will happen if I refuse to do the urine test? Will they refuse to give me my script?Or should I just be honest and say that it was my birthday and it was just a one off use? But then I'm worried they will refuse to give me my script for the Subutex.Please give me some advice on what I could do. I've already got Xanax and cocaine in my system and there's not enough time to get the drug's out of my urine.I can't use someone else's urine because I once did that and the test came invalid.The only option I have is to just say I can't get any urine out, but what if they make me wait until I need to go?Please any suggestions will help and I'll be very grateful. Also please comment serious replies only.The worst case scenario I guess is they will just get angry with me and make me pick up my subutex from the pharmacy daily and under supervision, which I don't want to do again.Sorry for the long post and I'm hoping to hear some helpful replies/advice. Many many thanks."

none,They can't use morphine because the Buprenorphine will put the person into instant withdrawal. Do they have to use fentanyl? Or some other alternative? Please serious replies only.
none,"Ignore the flair, I didn't know which one to pick.So I've heard that clenbuterol is used as an anabolic steroid for bodybuilders and athletes, but it got me wondering whether using such a drug which is a bronchodilator would do any damage to the body if someone doesn't have asthma?I'm not an athlete or a bodybuilder and don't plan on ever using clenbuterol, but some big athletes like Canelo Alvarez, Francisco Vargas and cyclist Alberto Contador tested positive for them, and there are probably thousands if not tens of thousands of people using it as a steroid.So what would the drug do to your body if you don't have asthma?"
none,The antipsychotic medications I'm mainly referring to are Quetiapine and olanzapine. How do they interact with cocaine? Will they just completely block the cocaine high or will they potentiate the high?Does anyone know? Thanks.
none,So my game is stuck at 100% and I was wondering whether this is a problem on my end or whether this is a problem for other people?
none,"Can someone explain this to me? I was using Darkseid, AKBM and PG. Towards the end of the battle both PG and AKBM got killed and I only had Darkseid.The opposite team still had 2 heroes left, and I would've beat them if I had more time but the timer ran out.I was expecting a ‘defeat' to show up because I didn't kill them all and had 1 hero left and the other team had 2, so why did I win the fight?If anybody wants to see please let me know I've recorded the whole fight because I wanted to show I can beat a 1mil team with my 340k threat team."
none,"No matter what, every time I use sp3 on Darkseid it only deals max 8.4mil damage. I've tried using DF to reduce defense hoping I would be able to deal more damage but nope.Even if he blocks KOAAM's SP3 attack it still deals 8.4mill damage.I know one of his passives is protective screen” which prevents you from dealing more damage than a certain percent, but is there any way to bypass this?"
none,"So I take 8mg subutex, I'm supposed to be taking the whole 8mg once a day but since I've been allowed to take it home I've been taking 4mg in the morning and 4mg in the evening because it seems to work better for me that way.But I've got this one friend who has never tried opioids and has been begging me to let him try at least 4mg, but I insisted no because of the potency of Buprenorphine.8mg is a really high dose, and it works well for me because I was a heavy user, but for an opioid naive person I've read even 2mg can be fatal.Just going to say first, I'm not planning on giving him ANYTHING for both his safety and I don't want to be left short of subutex and start withdrawing.But I'm curious, is it true that 2mg can kill an adult person who has never tried opioids?I've read online that it's like x50 or x100 stronger than Morphine, but acts in a different way and doesn't produce euphoria to people who use it to stay off heroin, like me.I'm curious to know what you guys think! Also I want this to be kind of a harm reduction post so please only comment if you are actually wanting to give helpful advice/information.Otherwise if the comment isn't for harm reduction purposes please don't post at all. Many thanks."
none,"I just unlocked her and got her straight to 4 stars, how can I now get her gear?Same goes for the other League of Anarchy characters (LLJ and EPI).I can't seem to find their gear ANYWHERE. Any tips?"
none,"So I had to pass a urine test to have my medicine dispensed and not under supervision, and I passed the test with flying colours so I can now pick up my Subutex to take home.Since I've been able to take it at home I've decided to split the 8mg tab in half and take 4mg in the afternoon and the other 4mg before bed. The reason for this is because I feel it works better for me this way and taking 8mg daily at once helped but my method helps with my cravings way better than taking the whole 8mg at once.I'm really happy I don't have to travel 20 mins to my nearest pharmacy to pick up my subutex everyday, and I'm hoping when I next have a meeting with my prescriber he will do another urine test and allow me to pick up once a week, which would be even better.Any thoughts on what I just said? Please feel free to share your opinion, I'd gladly read everyone's opinion on what I'm doing "

none,"So I'm currently in recovery, I'm on a Subutex script along with 3 other meds I take. My doctor advised me to take Quetiapine 2x25mg in the morning, 5mg Olanzapine PRN (as needed), then another 50mg Quetiapine at bedtime, along with 5mg olanzapine.I don't so drugs anymore because I'm on so many meds, but recently I kind of relapsed and started taking cocaine again, along weed but less so.Everything I take prescribed makes me drowsy and only the antipsychotic meds act on dopamine receptors.Is it safe to use cocaine whilst I'm on all of this?Please serious answers only."

Anybody making rude or judgemental comments will be reported.Many thanks!"
none,"Isn't Subutex a blocker and can cause precipitated withdrawal when takes together? I haven't used any opiate since I been on the script and I'm not planning to, even if they switch me to Methadone (which is what I wanted to see whether it works better for me)What if I said yes? Even though I haven't What would he say?"
none,"So my main team is Black Adam, Armored Superman and Shazam. These 3 have a threat of 420k now and can defeat easily teams with 1mil threat, but if they're using JLC then its more like 500k opposite team threat.These 3 are the best because BA is my damage dealer, AS is my tank/damage reflector and SZM is healer/arcane and might hero booster, so in the arena they do amazing.But obviously in raids KOAAM takes 10% of the bosses health, so for example I was just fighting boss Horrific Scarecrow who has 56M health.With 3 non-blocked SP3 hits he can deal over 15M damage, which is 27.1% of his total health.I'm now down to around 1.5% of his health, and KOAAM only deals just under 100k per hit now, so in total he deals just over 200k damage in total.My last battle took 800k health, that was with Black Adam, Powergirl and KOAAM, meaning BA alone dealt around 600k which is more than KOAAM.So at what percentage of health would it be better to start using a different team that will deal more damage?Or is that a matter of personal preference and who has who unlocked, and how much damage another team can deal?I hope this wasn't too confusing."
none,"So I've done all the research I could do personally on Olanzapine, as my psychiatrist switched me over from Quetiapine to Olanzapine and I'm starting it today.I will be taking 5mg at night, and 5mg PRN (as needed) up to twice a day at most, but the doctor said to not take it lightly as it will make me very drowsy, more than Quetiapine.If anybody has any sort of experience with Olanzapine please leave your comments down below so that anyone who is starting on it like me can have some reassurance/guidance apart from the doctor's advice.From my research Olanzapine is one of the strongest if not the strongest antipsychotics out there, and I feel it's necessary to have access to information on it as well as personal experiences since we all experience things differently."
none,"So what drugs can you booty bump? I've heard of many people using tampons, dipping them in something like clean pure vodka or absinthe, and sticking the tampon up their bum to get drunk.This method is VERY DANGEROUS by the way and shouldn't ever be performed.But out of curiosity what else could you stick up there?I'll just make a list and tell me which ones you can and can't booty bump:Xanax, Oxycodone (and other pill form opiates), Ecstasy, GHB, 2C-B, LSD, DMT...I've run out of drugs i forget what else there is even though I've tried almost everything there is out there myself.Let me know what ones you can and can't do, and which ones are the most dangerous to prevent people from doing them."
none,"Sorry for the flare, didn't know which one would be appropriate for this topic.But since Aspirin is a blood thinner, does it affect the drugs once they enter the bloodstream? Like do the drugs effects become stronger or weaker or are they unaffected?Just wondering because I never usually take aspirin, but I've ran out of paracetamol and I had a headache so I took 3x75mg Enteric-Coated Aspirin pills. The headache is gone, but I also take Buprenorphine. I'm having bad side effects from the Buprenorphine which my doctor has ignored (which I've already reported to the local authorities) so I'm taking Xanax to keep me from wanting to end it all.The Xanax I take is very low dose, I already have a tolerance but I don't use it to get high, I just take enough to make me less depressed and suicidal. It literally has saved my life, although I know I'm not supposed to be doing it."
none,"I'm level 46, you can see my roster on my account. I can deal many millions of damage during raids as I have KOAAM and many other great characters Please reply here or message me privately. Thank you!"
none,"So I've got a pretty big benzo tolerance, I usually take around 8x 2mg bars over the course of the day.Around 1-2 in the morning, like 3-4 throughout the day and 2-3 before bed.But as I am running low on the supply I tried to cut down a bit. I only took 1 in the morning today, then 2 at around 4-5pm and since then I haven't taken any more.Usually I need to take at least 2 in the evening to be able to get to sleep, but I read online that Xanax can be taken under the tongue and it goes straight to your bloodstream, so i split 1 2mg bar into 4 chunks and after 10 minutes i could feel it come on fast and strong.I'm properly nodding off now and struggling to type this, It took me around 15 mins to write all of this, but since now this is my favourite way of taking Xanax. Despite the bitterness and discomfort in my mouth.Alright I'm seriously going to sleep now, take care all of you!"
none,"So like the title says, all these are brand names for the drug Buprenorphine. When I got prescribed Espranor and started experiencing extremely bad side effects like severe depression, psychosis and suicidal thoughts, why did he switch me over to Prefibin?What is the point in that? I'm taking Prefibin and there is no difference in effects I still feel shit and have to self-medicate with Xanax, otherwise I would probably be dead already because the side effects are too much.What next? Is he going to prescribe me Subutex next? He's refusing to let me try Methadone because he's worried I will use on top, despite me offering him to do even daily urine tests at my own expense to prove I won't and don't want to use on top. I just want to be functioning again, I want my life back. Living like this is hell, and if it weren't for the Xanax numbing me out like I said I would probably be dead because the things I'm experiencing are too much."
none,"From what I've read Buprenorphine has the highest affinity for the opioid receptors except for fentanyl, so would fentanyl be administered for them? Or would they get a non-opiate based painkiller.If they were to get a non opiate painkiller, what would it be?"
none,"I know the main difference is that Espranor is a freeze dried wafer that dissolves ON your tongue in literally 30 seconds. Whereas Subutex dissolves UNDER the tongue and takes 5-10 mins to dissolve.But they're both Buprenorphine right?So why did my drug & alcohol clinic doctor switch me from Espranor to Subutex when Espranor was making me feel incredibly depressed, suicidal and unmotivated, amongst other negative side effects I experienced.I've been on the Subutex for like 3/4 days and i feel NO difference in their effects, literally feels the same as Espranor."

(Sometimes I have enough Power Bars to use 2 in a row)* I repeat the process until I have used KOAAM's SP3 3 times, then use BA's SP1, SP2 and mainly SP3 as it can deal 20k+ damage in 1 shot.Now I will explain what I do when I use Power Girl instead of Armored Superman:* Start with BA and since PG reduces teams power costs by 2, I can easily Spam SP1 until I get decreased power cost. Once I have decreased power cost I spam SP2 until enemy's power cost increases, and then spam SP3 until I steal their power bars.* Once I have almost full Power Bars, I switch to KOAAM and use SP3 either once or twice in a row.* Then switch back to Ba, and repeat the process I stated in 1st bullet point.* Then I use KOAAM's SP3 for the last time and go back to BA.* I keep spamming SP1, SP2, SP3 until I have full power bars, reduced ability cost and the enemy has increased power cost.* Then I use all 3 of my characters special moves.So this is it.

I also hope the long-ass read was worth it.I also have a guide for AKB,BNB and PG, but I will post that another day,"
none,"So while I was on Heroin that helped me sleep like a baby but since I've been on Buprenorphine I got severe insomnia and started taking Xanax (unprescribed) and my tolerance to it grew so quickly that Now even 4 bars won't make me tired.I'm open and willing to try any suggestions from everyone, thanks!"
none,"So I got a question, I am in the UK and here (at least in my area) they strictly ONLY prescribe Espranor (which is a freeze fried wafer that dissolves on your tongue in like 30 seconds)I was on Espranor last year and was absolutely fine on it, but this year I don't know why Espranor led to some serious negative side effects like depression, suicidal thoughts, more intense cravings than before starting on Espranor, I got a rash on my back too.My doctor just switched me to Buprenorphine which is basically Subutex (the pill you hold under your tongue) in hopes that it will help.So I started taking the Buprenorphine instead and mentally nothing has gotten better, I still feel the same as on the Espranor and day by day I'm feeling worse.I let my doctor and counsellor know this and they just said to keep taking it and allow my body to adjust but I've been taking it as prescribed everyday for almost 2 weeks now and I'm still feeling extremely down and got intense cravings.Today I had the idea to snort 2mg of the Buprenorphine (I usually take 6mg under the tongue) and I only wanted to do that to see if it will make me feel any better.Is there any risk involved? Will snorting it even have any effects? Please let me know what you guys think, many thanks!"
none,Let's say they had those 2mg little Subutex pills that contain only buprenorphine. What would happen if they snorted the 2mg pill?I've also heard of Suboxone which contain Naloxone which is meant to stop people from snorting and injecting the Subs.
none,"I got prescribed Espranor 6mg which is just Buprenorphine (I'm in the UK btw) and I've been having bad reactions to it. I've been feeling extremely depressed and had really bad thoughts, my cravings got even worse when I started taking it.My mum even noticed I've developed some weird rash on my back, and she said that I'm not myself since I've started taking them.Is it possible for my doctor to switch me to Methadone if I tell him all of this and that I don't feel that the Buprenorphine is helping? I've never been prescribed Methadone and never tried it and I wanted to give it a go to see if it is going to be better for me.Please let me know what I should do, thank you."
none,"So recently I've been put on Buprenorphine. I wanted to get Methadone prescribed but the doctor refused and prescribed Buprenorphine instead.I've been having a really negative reaction to the Buprenorphine, but in general if I am to be 100% honest I'm not sure I am ready or want to properly quit opiates.If I do detox and get off them I just know I will relapse fast so there is no point in me trying to get off them if I don't want to.Now I don't want to be using Heroin either, so would Methadone maintenance therapy be suitable and would the doctor agree to something like this? How should I bring it up to him?I don't want him to think I'm trying to get high off Heroin or Methadone or both, I just don't see Buprenorphine being helpful because it doesn't get rid of cravings and I end up using multiple other non-opiate drugs like benzos and stims.All I want is just to be put on a stable dose of Methadone and be kept on that until I feel I am ready to quit completely.Can someone please advise me what to do and what to say to the doctor? He's very reluctant to prescribe Methadone because it can be used along other opiates, but I am more than happy to do regular urine tests to prove I'm not using anything else."
none,"So I use Black Adam, KOAA, and Armored Superman for raids (for arena I replace KOAA with Shazam) and start with superman to take/deflect the damage.Once power bars fill up I use BA's SP1 until I get power cost decrease. Then once I have a lot of pips and power cost decrease, I switch to KOAA and use SP3. The trident goes right through the enemy and this happening even up to 3 times a match. Literally just a few minutes ago I only aguamans 1 SP3 in, the rest missed” although they shouldn't have.Has anyone else had this issue and know how to fix it? Thanks!"
none,"So it's that time of the year in the UK when spiders seek warmth and shelter, unfortunately they do so in our homes.I've seen a video somewhere which showed a person spraying their windowsills with pure lemon juice which is meant to scare off spiders as they don't like citrus smells.I sprayed my whole house with lemon juice, but was it actually worth it or was it a waste of time?"
none,"So I want to switch from Subutex to Methadone, the other day I went to get my prescription and I requested Methadone but the doctor said Subutex will be better for you” even though I've never been prescribed Methadone so how would he know.Has anyone made this switch? What are the rules involving switching, ie waiting 24 hours or more before you can take Methadone after Subutex.Ever since I've started taking the Subutex literally 2 days ago, I've been feeling the most low and depressed and suicidal I've ever been and it has forced me to buy Xanax.The Subutex hasn't helped get rid of the cravings AT ALL.I will try to bet the doctor next time I see him to switch me to Methadone because I'm not having a good reaction to it, and I feel like I have the right to at least try it to see what will help with the cravings better.I'll also tell them I'm MORE THAN HAPPY to take routine and random urine tests to prove that I am not going to be using Heroin on top, because if I'm to be honest I don't quite want to quit heroin fully yet, I don't feel ready, and being on Subutex it suppresses the withdrawals but I'm still craving like a bitch and I ended up taking Xanax.I'm in the UK by the way, so if any fellow brits could help me out and give some words of advice that would be greatly appreciated."
none,"So first a little back story: I was put on 8mg Subutex around a year ago to help me get off Heroin. I got off Subutex completely towards the end of January 2020. I stayed sober for a while, then I relapsed towards the end of March when lockdown was out in place.Yesterday I got to the clinic to pick up my prescription and I said that I wanted to try Methadone this time around, but the doctor refused and said Subutex is better for me, so I didn't want to argue and I left.He put me on 6mg this time, which isn't right because I was using more now than last year and last year he gave me 8mg? But anyways that's not the issue I'm having. When I took my 1st dose of Subutex (6mg) after 10-15mins I started feeling extremely sad and depressed, towards the evening I was having REALLY bad thoughts.I tried to shrug it off thinking it's my 1st dose, maybe my body is adjusting to it but nope. Today I took my 2nd dose and I'm feeling even worse, at some points even suicidal. I told the pharmacist dispensing my meds (has to be supervised for the first 3 months) and he said to call my prescriber/counsellor. I couldn't get a hold of them though.What do I do? I don't want to take the Subs if they're making me feel so fucking depressed and suicidal, but I don't want to stop taking them because I don't want to withdraw.Next week I am going to beg my doctor to let me switch to Methadone instead, to see if that will be better for me.Please, any advice, thoughts or anything will be appreciated. Thank you."
none,"So tomorrow I'm getting my script for either Methadone or Buprenorphine. The reason I say either is because I don't exactly know until tomorrow which one I'm getting. Why? Well I told my counsellor I wanted to try Methadone this time instead of Buprenorphine as I've already been on it once, but he said he's not sure whether they prescribe Methadone right now due to COVID.It's a bit of a BS reason and I bet they do, but hey if they don't I'm not going to turn down Subs whilst I'm withdrawing.So I had my last dose yesterday afternoon, I somehow made it through alright yesterday and managed to get some sleep, but today I woke up with extreme sweats, shakes, aches and general dysphoria.What's the best way to get through today to make time pass? When it comes to other drugs I've got some weed and a little bit of amphetamine (I've got ADD so it doesn't make me twitchy and speedy) which I can take at any time to help ease the withdrawals.But I want to try to keep busy without them, anyone have any ideas what I could do? I am not working this week so that's out the window. Thanks!"
none,"So I've got a question which I partly know the answer to, but not completely and need someone to further explain things to me properly.So I will soon be starting maintenance therapy with either Methadone or Buprenorphine. I want to stop using Heroin but I also want to learn self control.I was on Buprenorphine before and it didn't teach me self-control, it just scared me from using opioids because my counsellor told me if I use Heroin whilst on Buprenorphine then I will enter precipitated withdrawal instantly. I want to try Methadone this time because then I will still have full access to Heroin if I wish to use, but that's not the point. The point is to learn to live without it.Now I know that taking Buprenorphine less than 4 hours after your last Heroin dose can cause precipitated withdrawal, but can using Heroin after you've taken a dose of Buprenorphine cause precipitated withdrawal too?"
none,"So I've been using from time to time (maybe once a week or so) amphetamine sulphate powder around an hour before I plan to sleep.After snorting a small line of it, within 10 minutes I feel completely at ease with my mind, calmer than ever, I start to feel even sleepy but usually the sleepiness comes after an hour.I am diagnosed with ADD, but don't take any medication as I have an ongoing drug problem and already take antipsychotic medication for other mental health issues.Does anyone else use or ever used amphetamine in this way? Is this normal or quite abnormal for someone like me?"
none,"So I've taken Phenibut for the first time ever and I'm slightly disappointed with the effects. It's been almost 3 hours (around 2 and a half) and I feel almost the same as usual, no relaxing, calming or chill effects.I took 3.22g approximately. I was going to take 3.5g but that was already considered a heavy dose so I stuck with 3.22g.Would it make sense to take more now? Or will the effects kick in soon? I thought it would be comparable to Diazepam meaning it would be slightly sedating but not like Xanax.additionally I think my backs starting to hurt a bit too, which would lead me to believe this is affecting my kidneys in some way because whenever I take drugs and have lower back pain it's due to kidneys being affected."
none,"So I couldn't find any information on this on the internet and wanted to ask on here for opinions, or if somebody is educated and actually knows what's going on then the answer.Thanks in advance!"
none,"I was thinking, what's all the hype about? He can't be that powerful... especially how I have a pretty solid team already and do a lot of damage in general in solo and league raids (3rd boss on solo and T6 raids).But when I got him after finally gathering 160 shards from the league store, I levelled him up, and realised that his SP3 deals 10% of the enemy's HP.Woah. My solo raid damage more than doubled, and what I thought would be weeks of progress before I finish the sub bosses and boss, now with him it will probably only take me a week if not a couple days.Haven't bought any gear for him yet though, but now I see why he's such a beast for raids."
none,So what do you guys think of the Black Manta chest for 450gems? Is it worth buying?Is it worth more buying x10 chests or should I wait for a different chest/sale?
none,"So I've been just an average guy, started Kung fu at an age like 7-8 and did that or 4-5 years. Only god yo a 2nd Degree Blue belt but quit soon after.I have also been doing boxing (not professionally or anything at first) but I started young mainly at home, bought some training pads with my dad and we trained quite a lot. My dad always focused on endurance and speed, because we were short but bulky and dextrous. We hd brutal sparring sessions before I joined a gym and did amamteur.That's when I learned, you can use your brain to not feel pain in specific areas.It's all psychological. When I feel pain I feel stronger because the pain is euphoric, it makes me want it more.So I was thinking of going back into boxing and MMA and try get to the UFC.  Because fuck it why not."
none,"So I take regularly Quetiapine twice a day. The way this medication helps me is it quietens down my mind. When I don't take the medication I can hear my thoughts out loud as if someone was speaking to me and I kind of lose control of myself and I do as the voices say.I also take mirtazapine at night to help me get to sleep.Right now I'm experiencing some psychosis and I took Xanax (not prescribed) to help quieten down my head and the voices. But it's not working.What should I do, should I take more of the prescribed antipsychotics or what? I'm so confused and don't know what to do. If anyone could help me find some solutions I'd be so grateful."
none,"I just read this somewhere online, and it hit me so hard I had to share it on here.My crutch was, and still is Opioids. When I'm alone is when I'm most likely to use drugs and being in my own company is so incredibly dangerous.Addiction can't be beaten alone, and it's always best to reach out to people during difficult times, like now with COVID, lockdown and restrictions put in place to help decrease the spread of the virus.Even when told to stay home, you mustn't stay alone. Always stay connected to your friends and family, reach out to them.I just want to wish all struggling with addiction the best in the future, and just remember that you are all stronger than you think, but your brain prevents you from believing that."
none,"What should I spend the gems on? What chests are the best? I've already unlocked most gold and silver heroes but I haven't got any legendaries.I want to get darkside or arkham night batman, but not sure what chests to buy.Or should I wait until there's a discount and different hero chests.Thanks to everyone who comments. "
none,"So I take 2 medications. I take Quetiapine twice a day and mirtazapine at night. I am also using Heroin but I am going on to Methadone soon so I'm just using very little. Not to get high but to get rid of the withdrawals.Today I took 2x 2mg Xanax over the course of the last 2 hours, and I smoked a little bit of weed. Would it be safe to take a little line of amphetamine just to give me a little boost because right now I feel very sedated and I want to be functional.I've got ADHD, but benzos kind of subside the symptoms so i feel okay now, but when I take amphetamine I don't get hyper, I get more motivation, I'm focused and my mind is clear and I'm not hyper or over active.Let me know what you guys think, whether amphetamine (1 little line) is reasonable or should I avoid it, because on what other drugs I am currently taking too.I usually don't have any adverse effects, but I don't take xans regularly so was worried to mix with those."
none,"Hey guys, does Chlorphenamine help with the opiate itch? I haven't got any Promethazine laying around at the moment, usually Promethazine helps a bit with the itch but I've only got Chlorphenamine now.Cetrizine and loratadine don't help me with the itch whatsoever, although loratadine works wonders for my hay fever (somehow)"
none,"A quick question to those who have used both. When I was coming off H several months ago I wanted to try Buprenorphine because to me a green liquid didn't sound as appealing as a wafer that dissolved in 2 seconds and gets into the blood as fast.When I'm rehab I went from the wafers to pills which take ages to dissolve, and eventually off subs in February.Shortly after I got into an abusive relationship, and stupid me instead of leaving I started taking Heroin again to pretend she's not treating me like shit and deal with her. To be fair to her she had BPD, and I wanted to help her but I ended up just fucking myself up and not helping her.Now after being locked in the house high on H almost non stop due to covid and nothing else to do, I've lost a lot of motivation, gained over 10kg in weight and my depression and suicidal thoughts worsened.I don't see myself getting off opiates forever right now due to several injuries from the past leaving me in pain 24/7, but I wanted to try Methadone this time.I work at a restaurant, will I be able to function properly? I heard Methadone can make you really sleepy, almost like H unlike Buprenorphine.Also Buprenorphine scared me once because when I was on 8mg and didn't make it to the pharmacy on time on a Sunday, I couldn't take even codeine w/paracetamol to prevent withdrawals, which were starting around 30 hours after the last dose.My social worker said he'd prefer me on Subs because it deters you from using other opiates due to PW."
none,"So due to my extremely confusing and let's say fucked up schedule and routines, I withdraw from heroin a lot. I would say in a month I can withdraw 3-4 times.The reason for that is because I'm a functioning addict, I work, I pay bills, I'm very sensible with everything and I am addicted to heroin. However I am also a blood donor, and as Males are only allowed to give blood every 12-14 weeks or so, I get off heroin a week before the donation to clear my system out.During that time (before the donation) I stay clean and don't use any drugs, and the withdrawals are the strongest days 1-3. These days I would take hot baths twice a day, preferably with some Bath salts in the water so your body can benefit from the nutrients and minerals in the bath salts. (Actual bath salts, not flakka or spice or anything)I drink plenty of water, keep busy and active throughout the day. Now you're probably thinking how is he up and about doing things when he's at the peak of the withdrawals?The answer is: I force myself, push past the discomfort and pain, just go hardcore, but not over the top. That way you get an endorphins rush, which mimic opioids and believe it or not for a short period of time your withdrawals disappear.Stay well hydrated, well nourished, keep active, push yourself to the max, don't let anything stand in your way.Now after I donate blood, I usually go back on to the heroin, but due to COVID everything is delayed, so I end up waiting around a week more for a reload.How do I prevent/manage withdrawals with other drugs? I mainly use Xanax. The physical pain won't go away, the chills/flashes may not go away, but restlessness and anxiety will go away.I don't recommend using Xanax for this purpose, but this is how I'm dealing with the withdrawals right now.Other drugs that have helped me with withdrawals:Ketamine - For a short period of time it can numb you out and dissociate you from your body, helping the withdrawals.Benzos - All benzos; Xanax, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Clonazepam, Temazepam etc. All of those help with the restlessness and anxiety.Cannabis - Doesn't help with any withdrawal symptoms, but the high makes you kind of forget and you feel more comfortable, but it won't help like benzos will.If anybody has any other ideas or method to help people get through withdrawals, please feel free to comment and share your thoughts. I hope we can all benefit from this "
none,"So currently I would say my team is pretty decent. I'm level 32, and my trio are: Black Adam, Level 50, 4 stars, gear at level 25, level 2 azure arcane amulet, 81k threat. Armored Superman, Level 50, 5 stars, gear at level 20, level 5 azure might amulet, 67k threat. Shazam, Level 51, 3 stars, gear at level 20, level 2 azure arcane amulet, 59k threat.This trio is OP in my opinion. Total threat is almost 220k but I can easily beat almost any team with 400-500k threat (if there are legendaries then 300-400k).I'm on solo raid 2 and with the trio I deal anywhere from 300-500k damage per battle with the bosses. Anyone know any good tips on how to increase damage further? Maybe what talents to choose, what chance effects to focus on/prioritise on the gear? Where to spend my coins (abilities/talents)?Any little bit of help is greatly appreciated! I've already spent a lot of real money on the game, and I wanted to maximise my damage and form the best team without having to pay to be better. Many thanks once again, and I hope everyone had a great day!"
none,"Tell me how is this possible? Is he using hacks? He is only level 32, has a TTV of around 750k and his best character is batman ninja Harley Quinn and she has 60k threat.He deals on a regular over 100 million damage on every raid. How is this possible?"
none,"So I haven't done ketamine in years, last time being maybe 2017, not sure but today I did a bump from a friend and the Ketamine was pretty strong, I had enough to feel very spacey and wonky, however it didn't disable me nor did I experience the K-hole”.The issue I'm having now is that I feel really shitty, depressed and in general just sad and I can't pinpoint why. I never used to feel like this after doing ketamine, I always felt normal once the ketamine effects wore off.Anyone got any ideas whether this is normal? Or what could help to get rid of this feeling? Thanks."
none,"So this is a serious question and I'm mainly asking those who have been shot in the past and fortunately survived the ordeal.What does it feel like? I heard being shot in the stomach feels like a punch to the gut from a heavyweight, followed by a stinging cold sensation where the wound is, but I've never been shot and I would never want to be shot, but I am curious about how it feels.Thanks to everyone who answered!"
none,Plain and simple.
none,"So I'm guessing there is no material that won't eventually weaken and break, causing the whole structure to collapse. When would that happen to a building like the Burj Khalifa, given that no repairs or renovations were ever made to it?Are we talking hundreds of years, or thousands?"
none,"So I've decided to take a small break from the H, and the worst part at the beginning is the withdrawals. Would taking 250mg of codeine help prevent the withdrawals? I would snort around 0.2g each day.The way I would take the codeine is do a CWE on codeine w/ acetaminophen.EDIT: I just wanted to add I'm a blood donor and I went for a blood donation yesterday. For anyone who says I can't donate when high on heroin, I've stopped taking it before the test to make sure I get as much out of my system as possible. Would this affect anything?"
none,If polygraph exam results aren't admissible in court then why does the FBI conduct them? Is it a way of making someone admit to something they done? I just don't understand.
none,"So I know some people have been completely deaf and blind since birth, and that hasn't stopped any one of them from still getting proper education and even exceeding at life than people with no health issues.How is it done? Who teaches those children everything? How do they read if they've never heard or seen a word? Just something I've always been curious about."
none,"So like I was just wondering whether this would be possible and if it would give any effects, and how those effects would compare to taking it differently (snorting, smoking and IV)I know that heroin freebase cannot get absorbed into the bloodstream on its own, and first it has to be converted to the salt form (usually by mixing it with citric/ascorbic acid and water + heating) but given that the stomach is full of a very potent acid, would it not just convert into the salt form in the stomach and proceed to get absorbed in the stomach & intestines?The thing is I have never taken heroin IV, I would always snort it and I would snort the freebase form which got me thinking that swallowing it might be more effective and efficient than I first thought. Any ideas?"
none,"So hear me out before you call me or this question stupid (even though it kind of is hence why I'm asking here), I was just watching crime documentaries on YouTube and there was one where a woman shot her husband then tried to stage it to make it seem like he shot himself.This got me thinking, imagine if you are in a room with a friend and he hands you a gun, and tells you to shoot yourself, otherwise he will shoot you with another gun. Why would such a thing happen? I don't know, but instead you shoot him in self-defence.You then call the police and explain what has happened, but how would they prove that you are telling the truth and not just saying that it was self-defence to get away with murder?Like if there are only you two in a room, there's no cameras or witnesses, how would the police prove that you did this in self-defence to prevent getting shot.Sorry in advance if the answer is obvious."
none,"So like in the title, can I use those nice-smelling tumble dryer sheets to dry certain drugs such as speed (amphetamine)?Well, I'm mainly talking about drying amphetamine by putting some in a closed box with 1-2 dryer sheets, then leaving it there for like 24 hours or something.Or does this only work in theory, and in practice it would be a failure? Any ideas? If this does work would it also be good in drying weed, if you like put a sheet in a jar with some bud?One things for certain though, regardless of whether it works or fails, the speed will sure as hell be smelling like fresh laundry towards the end of it all."
none,"So I took 100mg of Baclofen, and I'm still not feeling anything. The Baclofen I have is prescription grade, so there's no possibility of it being bunk.Any ideas why I'm not feeling anything?"
none,"So to keep it short, I took 1.2g of Pregabalin at noon for recreational purposes. The high lasted up until around 6:30pm when it started to die down, so the high lasted around 6-7 hours. It is now 9:10pm and I will be heading to bed soon.If I take 600mg at 10 or 11pm, would it get me high at all? Would it make me slightly sleepy? Or will it be a total waste of pregabalin?I'm not sure whether to take any more, as I have trouble getting to sleep, but then again if taking 600mg isn't going to make any difference then I might as well not take it.I'm saying 600mg because that's all I have left. Thanks in advance for the help!"
none,"So I have recently got hold of some Pregabalin, and have been taking it recreationally, but on my 3rd day of taking it I have noticed some strange side effects.So just to clear things up a bit, on day 1 I have taken a total of 600mg spaced out over the course of a day, then I woke up in the morning on the 2nd day and everything was fine. On the 2nd day, I took a total of 750mg over the course of a day. I didn't and never would take such high doses in 1 go by the way. Now I went to sleep and slept very well. I woke up on the 3rd day in the morning and that day I knew I couldn't take any because I would be driving to visit my dad, so I had to be 100% sober for 2 reasons; driving and visiting family.However I noticed almost immediately in the morning that my hands would be shaky, and I was just holding my phone in my hand when suddenly my hand got a split second spazzed and basically gave up. I dropped my phone on the floor.I thought oh well my hand just spazzed, nothing major but Over the course of the day I noticed my hands would be shaky and my hands would be randomly giving up.I'm not sure how to explain this, but it literally feels like my muscles just switch off for a second. I tried holding a pen, and unsurprisingly after a few seconds of holding the pen, my hand spazzed and I dropped the pen.Now I started freaking out thinking already the worst; already thinking it's Parkinson's, or some other neurological condition.I knew I had taken pregabalin the day before and thought it could be that, so I didn't take any pregabalin for the rest of the day and the spazzing died out towards the end of the day, but nevertheless it still freaked me out a lot.Could anybody with some knowledge or experience please weigh in on this matter? I am worried, and not sure what to do.Any questions and ideas welcome. Many thanks."
none,"So I am just asking out of curiosity, and I stated opiates like Heroin, Oxycodone and codeine because I have tried them all and know what they feel like.Anyone with experience in all or any of those, how do they compare? And what doses of hydromorphone are roughly equivalent to say 50mg of Oxycodone or 100mg of Heroin?I'm mainly asking just for research and curiosity purposes. Many thanks."
none,"So I received a £200 tesco gift card from my company to support those with low income salaries and everyone who's struggling during the COVID epidemic, and I have redeemed the code and was reading through the info and terms and conditions, and in one place it stated:Your card number is unique and the total value can only be redeemed once”Does this mean I must redeem all £200 or close to it at once, or am I allowed to say spend £120 of it on day 1 and on day 2 spend the rest (£80)?I'm really confused with this and would appreciate any help. Thanks."
none,"So like the title states, is it possible to take heroin orally? I am asking as I am a user, but I only snort it. I have never smoked or injected and don't plan on doing so, but I've recently wanted to experiment with heroin, because I've been keeping more busy each day as lockdown rules lift in the UK I don't have the need or urge to get high, but I want to avoid withdrawal.Would say parachuting 50mg of heroin have stronger effects than snorting 50mg? Or would there be little to no effects? How does this route of administration differ? Would prefer anyone with some chemistry background to explain, but am open to all ideas. Thanks."
none,"So the title should explain almost all of it, but let me elaborate on the details.  I've taken around maybe 50-100mg of M by snorting in the past hour, and I have ~50mg (more or less) wrapped in rizla.  I would like to add that I have taken a small line of heroin at around the same time as the MKAT, and I've taken around 50mg maybe less (normal dose for me).The effects I am feeling now is slightly blurred/double vision, feeling good (like coming down off MDMA), bit lethargic but full of energy, dry mouth and enhanced senses I.e sound, touch, visually everything looks sharper when I focus.I am not feeling any negative side effects except from flushing on my face, a blocked nose and feeling hot.Would it be safe for me to take the 50mg bomb of MKAT? Would it have the same effects as when snorting it or is it different?How long after my last dose of MKAT would I be allowed to take heroin (snorted) ?I also have Xanax, however I will not be taking those due to the deadly interactions with opiates.Thanks."
none,"I have read up somewhere online that Turmeric can have MAOI properties and it can affect certain medication, like opioid painkillers or SSRI's and so forth.Does anybody know the exact mechanism of this and could provide any more information on this, or if this isn't true please let me know. Thanks."
none,"Please nobody here judge, I am genuinely curious what those who bite their nails/toenails do with them and why do they do it?I mainly do it from stress, it keeps me occupied and I lower my anxiety. But I'd like to hear from others what their habits are.IMPORTANT: please do not make any offensive remarks to anyone ,because for me biting my nails makes me insecure but it's a coping mechanism for stress and anxiety.Anyone else got any similar stories to share?Serious replies only, no trolling or offensive remarks though please! Thanks!"
none,"So I've done a cold water extraction of 32 Nurofen+ pills containing 200mg of Ibuprofen and 12.8mg of codeine phosphate each. I have crushed the tablets, let them soak in water for 15-20 minutes, stirred the water and placed it in the freezer for 15 minutes, then I got a 2 pieces of kitchen towel and folded it several times, wet the paper and used it as a filter.I discarded the white precipitate at the bottom of the Pyrex glass, as this was clearly ibuprofen and binders, as well as a lot of precipitate collected in the filters, yet my solution was still milky.I have read the box leaflet and discovered that the pills binders are: microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycollatre, starch pregelatinised, hypromellose, opaspray white M-1-17111 B and talc.Of which only the starch pregelatinised and hypermellose were soluble in water, the rest was practically insoluble in water.The solubility of ibuprofen is 21mg/L of water at 25°C, I used 200ml in the extraction.Is it safe to drink the resulting solution with codeine, given everything I said, and also given the fact the solution is still milky?(The milky-ness of the is the thing concerning me most, as usually extraction with paracetamol in contrary to ibuprofen results in an almost crystal clear solution, with minor cloudiness).Thanks I'm advance."

Constant state of tiredness (not like super tired but I nap alot). Morning headaches. Feel like I would have extreme case of it. I have aspirations to continue my time in, and go to selection and stuff. Would kill me if sleep apnea would stop that. I don't like LOVE the Army so much that I can't bare to part with it but I really do like my job, gives me satisfaction and now I have wishes to do the higher-speed things.

Therapist is almost sure I have it, as well as my doc but it can't be documented unless I do the sleep study. I am planning to buy a CPAP off-record. $700, large investment but not really since it's for my health.

Fatass was shook 😂He proceeded to yell, which does not work at all ffs, I'm a military guy. I told him I'll listen when his fatass loses some weight, ( I'm trying to save his life by keeping him from having a damn heart attack) and he looked so offended 😂😂 Then as I'm walking away he says I can't just walk away! LOL CALL THE COPS? Like what the fuck do you mean? 😂If you're a boss and take your career at dominos THIS seriously, you're a loser and that's facts.

That is all EASY compared to watching your 4-legged buddy being put down. Nothing else I've ever endured has been this difficult.

Hell, I even teach them how to sham.Has this all fucked me over before? Sure, but not as often as you think. I feel like I literally have the best team cohesion in the entire Army. By just acting like a person, my soldiers work their hardest and are generally very happy to work alongside me even if the work itself sucks. I also noticed they act a lot more mature than most soldiers in the entire rest of the company/BN/BDE/DIV. I know if it came to it, my guys would have my back. Just wanted to share my style of leadership to the rest of y'all here. Is it the right answer? To Army standard, fuck no. But it works, and I've noticed a huge difference between the results of other leadership styles amongst peers."
none,"What a fun game! Huge Oddworld fan yet I never played this one till now! Played all the others including Stranger's Wrath but not this one. So am I really a true fun lol? I like the break it took from 2D platforming. Having a blast playing the big bro sligs and gunning down other sligs. And Munch's sections are unique, having disadvantages and being slow on land without a wheelchair but a beast in the water. Also like the little SoBe sponsorship they had in it, not something you see too much in game nowadays (last game I played with sponsors in it was Sunset Overdrive with Vans clothing in it) Great game though overall. I'm disappointed I didn't play it sooner. I've always seen it around, both remastered and original Xbox. I picked it up for Xbox, still a $5 game so I'm glad it was cheap too. Be cool if they do a reboot with today's tech like they just did for Soulstorm, which IMO is also a great game even if it's not the original."

Her parents are drastically like disappointed and upset with her. She's 24 years old, she can do what she wants for fuck sake. She didn't get a nazi swatstika, or Satans cock on her skin for crying out loud. It's not on her face. (I can understand shitty face tats making parents upset).

I know the guy meant no negativity towards me whatsoever but for some reason  I was like disappointed. It's weird why I felt that way. Like I grow my hair out, so I don't stick out with the high and tight. I also don't wear your typical Grunt Style/ ASMDSS / Zero Foxtrot clothing. I don't try to act like I'm some disciplined person like some soldiers do in public. I don't know I just can't explain it. Like I feel like a peasant to the people we live around off base. Soldiers get a bad rep for doing dumb shit (rightfully so) and I hate being grouped into that.

none,"Hey, thanks for your hugs and your hugz from last night.So, one of the often debated topics here is was there more than one killer?  Even LE has said ""one or more"" (or, was it ""one or two""?) when discussing perps.  Over the weekend someone cited a blog that speculated -- because it's not official like most everything else in this case -- that there are three male voices that can be detected on the audio.   Also, several people have mentioned the story about the woman property owner who encountered a young man who claimed to be having car trouble and said he was waiting for his father.  Taking these elements together, I have a couple of things to speculate on: 1. LM and GK are about the same age.  In such a small community they most probably would have met even if they didn't run in the same circles.  Maybe LM and his friends purchased rugs from GK and his friends and associates.  In some of the posts about more than one killer, people have speculated that the sketches represent older and younger perps, maybe a father and son.  We know that one o the first search warrants served soon after the murders was on the M household and some people have said the father resembles the first sketch (imo, LM does resembles the second sketch).  Interestingly, one of the recent local rumors has been that MK, GK's father, was involved.  Two sets of possibles with two possible fathers.  I use ""possible"" not to say it's likely, but to say it's been discussed, aired, speculated about. FWIW.2. When I was a kid, some friends and I parked my car -- I had just gotten my license --  and we hiked through the woods to a pay-to-fish pond and were fishing (and trespassing) when the owner came crashing through the brush.  Each of us took off in different directions and eventually made our ways back to the car.  When I got there, one of my friends had made it and we waited for our other friend (during which the state police caught us.  We had to go before a magistrate who drove a tractor in rom his fields to deal with us, favorably I might add).  The point o the story is it is believable that two or three people doing something in the woods separate as they make their ways back to their vehicle.  For ther Seinfeld fans, I call that my tractor story.Finally, I'll just reiterate that LE thought this was going to be a slam dunk and proceeded to serve the warrants that would provide the proof and something went wrong.  Whether it's an errant alibi, or a missing weapon, or some other piece of evidence that has proven problematic, LE seemed to think they had it at the outset."

none,"Just watched a doc on Gwen Greenblatt, a woman who was shot to death in her own home in Florida.  The thing is is that LE and everyone else seems to know who did it: her husband.  There's a FB page devoted to his arrest: [https://www.facebook.com/pg/arrestmattgreenblatt/posts/](https://www.facebook.com/pg/arrestmattgreenblatt/posts/)**They have his DNA** and the DNA of a possible accomplice on cigarette butts found outside the victim's door.  The husband did admit to smoking out on a patio because his wife didn't allow smoking, but that doesn't explain why a butt was near the front door.  The husband even tested positive for gunshot residue.  When LE confronts the suspected accomplice, he just insists the science is wrong because he's never been at that location.  No arrests have yet been made.My point is LE has a strong suspect with a DNA match, and yet there have been no arrests because they say there is nothing to directly link the husband to the crime that would hold up in court.  LE in Delphi may be in the same boat as many have speculated about here."

none,"I was reading through some old posts and came across JD as a POI.  What I can't find is anything that indicates he was cleared by LE although the assumption among posters seems to that he was. Check his pic and the BG sketch.  One reason this is interesting is that one bit of speculation/rumor I've read is that LE identified BG in the first sketch, he was a sex offender, and he was cleared (thus, the second sketch).  A sex offender who was on the bridge that day, but was cleared?   If that's true, then is it possible that JD is who was identified as BG and cleared -- if, in fact, he was cleared?"
none,"Once in a while, I have to take stock. I'm leaving out the distracting minutiae and just going for basics.  Here's the point I'm at now:1. The perp is either someone who no one suspects and who's long gone -- an organized killer who somehow was familiar with the area but lives elsewhere -- or the perp or perps is/are local and considered suspect by at least some in LE. 2. The perp is not a local person who no one suspects.  With video and audio, if the perp were local, they'd be identified in light of the tens of thousands of tips LE has received.  *Despite LE maintaining that we'll be surprised, there is not some member of the Delphi community who no one suspects who did these murders.* 3. If LE does not have a strong POI in the Delphi area, then it's confusing that they won't release more information about the crime and promote it far and wide along with information about the reward in order to generate more leads from a wider geographical area.  At the same time, if LE has a suspect who is being alibied by some unsuspecting member of the family, then that also makes one wonder why they won't release more information.4. If they do have a strong POI, then why not bring them in in a very public way for questioning as LE often does in cases?  \[I have to mention here that it was heartening to hear Kelsi say in an interview that all of her friends had been interviewed by LE.\]  People here make the point that LE knows who did it, but can't prove it or there is a lack of evidence in terms of going to trial.  IMO, again, why not bring them in?  It creates a whole new atmosphere in which some people may start talking and the suspect could start making mistakes.  Why let a lack of judicial-level evidence stop LE from making a move and a statement? 5. **CONCLUSIONS:**  Members of LE are split on this case and so we get confusing press conferences.  Some think they have the guy{s) but won't arrest him/them or don't have to act quickly because they are incarcerated (like GK and associates, IMO the most likely of local killers)); and some are looking for a serial killer who could be operating anywhere, or a non-local guy who for some reason committed a double murder one day in Indiana and went back to a normal life.  6. I can't get past the fact that LE won't release any more information as if they do not need any more information.  Thoughts?"
none,"There's the assumption that BG was fairly organized esp. in light of his elusiveness, and yet some believe that he was a guy full of rage who just blew that day and committed murders maybe after quickly putting together a disguise and kill kit.  Given the fact he's presumably getting away with it, that seems like a longshot.  Still, minus any other viable motive at this point, it seems that someone who commits this kind of brutal murder would be filled with hate and anger if they're not suffering from some kind of psychosis (""God told me to do it"").**So, how does that work?**  A person is hate-filled and angry and belligerent in their personal interactions and they fume and think about killing people.  Once the person experiences this serious ideation and is pretty sure he is gong to kill at some point does the anger subside?  Now, he's got a mission, needs to put together a plan and he doesn't want anyone thinking about him as an overly angry person, so does his behavior change at that point and he becomes a less noticeable member of the community?  Before the ideation he may not have cared who thought he was a mean asshole or hateful, but now that he has a mission he's got to lay low?"

none,"I do not completely understand geocaching and I am not pointing my finger at anyone as the killer: I am just asking a question.Does anyone who has followed this particular aspect of the case know if there was any animosity between CM and Kelsi?  Any rivalry or, perhaps, a dispute over some geocaching activity / discovery?  Rumor has it that neither girl was sexually assaulted, but that some of the crime scene may have been designed to look like it; and there is a rumor that some substance such as bleach was used to ruin any DNA evidence.Those things sound fairly sophisticated to me and if you remove a sexual motive, then what are other motives?  This question is based in part on the idea that Libby may have been mistaken for Kelsi who had lent Libby her hoodie.  And that academia is a cauldron."
none,"Robert Lindsay has been a lot of attention here recently as he pushes his Mr. X / PB theory of the crime.  On his blog, he listed six things that he says have been confirmed to him or members of his ""team"" by various members of LE, some of whom do not work the Delphi case.What are your opinions, or what have you heard, about any or all of these six pieces of what he calls ""very controversial information"" (I shortened #6):1. **Both girls were posed.** Keep in mind that they did not say how they were posed, if they were posed in a sexual manner, etc. **Source: A detective in Indiana.**2. **Dolls were scattered about the crime scene.** There were quite a few of them. Our police source told us, There were so many dolls scattered around that it looked like he had gone to the Goodwill store and bought a bunch of dolls.” This also answers questions about why the cops have been using phrases like odd,” peculiar,” strange,” not your average crime scene,” many signatures,” etc. It fits right in with all of that. **Source: A detective in Indiana.**3. **A bottle of toilet cleaner was found at the crime scene.** Presumably it was used to throw bleach over everything, which solves the riddle of why no usable DNA was collected in this case. **Source: A detective in Indiana.**4. **The girls were violated with inanimate objects.” Source: A detective in Indiana.**5. **Sticks, twigs, and branches were jammed into the girls lower orifices.** Presumably this is what the violated with inanimate objects” statement above refers to this. **Sources:** **A narcotics detective in Indiana and a close associate of a detective working on the case.**6. **One girl was pregnant, just barely pregnant.** This is one very old rumor that started up within a few weeks of the murder. The first person who told me that was a middle aged woman who lived in the area. Just saying that for everyone who accuses me of making this up.... Sn Indiana LE officer affirmed to us that this rumor was true. If police had not verified this rumor for us, I wouldn't be bothering with it because it's brought me nothing but trouble. But when we get information straight from the police, we feel we must report it. This is *not* a rumor I relish reporting. Trust me. \[The\] exact quote was, One of the girls was in the early stages of pregnancy.”... **Source:** **A sheriff's officer in a nearby county.**"
none,"Totally unscientific and there weren't that many responses, but the majority response was UNKNOWN.  IMO, that means people are leaning toward a non-local, highly organized killer.  Obviously, tips were not called in on UNKNOWN.  Eyeballing it, the two possible POIs considered most likely are PB and GK.  And I was surprised about the few MH selections."
none,Consider this an informal poll that might give us a feeling for how tips have been distributed across possible POIs.**Who are your top three suspects in order of likelihood with first choice being most likely; second choice the second most likely; and the third choice as third most likely.**In cases where initials will only be confusing -- such as DP -- then you may want to use a first name or a full name.  Use UNKNOWN for an unknown perp.I'll start:  1) GK  2) UNKNOWN  3) PBOnce I collect responses I will tabulate the results.

none,"Consider this a little bit of prolonged brainstorming.Since the murders happened, people have been on the lookout for changes in appearances and/or behavior.  LE even asked them to.  I've seen many posters here speculate that there are a number of ways that BG could be eluding capture:  hiding in plain sight as a community member, hermit-like living with an aged parent, a sociopath who shows absolutely no signs of stress because he doesn't feel any, etc.  Let's say the killer is a sociopath who feels no remorse for what he's done and is getting on with his life (with or without fantasies of more killing).  Let's say he's well-known in the area as a teacher or member of LE or cleric or a farmer and he just keeps on keeping on.  That could be.  But the concept I cannot accept is that the person who did this always appeared completely ""normal"" -- incapable of such a crime -- before the murders. If we are dealing with some kind of psychologically motivated crime as opposed to something like a drug-related crime, then there have got be things in this person's life that would absolutely indicate he's capable of such a crime.  No one is normal but for violent fantasies for decades, commits a double murder one day, and then goes back to being normal again.  There has to be a history of abuse against or by the perp., there may be writings, there may be a history of reading about murders and killings (like us here), animal abuse, etc.While everyone was looking around at their neighbors for signs of weird behavior or appearance changes, I think they key could lie in someone remembering something that someone once said or did or a pattern of bizarre and violent interests.    All this to say that if this is a psychological crime then it didn't start and end on Feb. 13, 2017.  It began sometime before that no matter how well he may be fitting in after the murders."

What if LE announced that it has a suspect or suspects or that it has even made an arrest or arrests and that the people or person arrested are GK and one or more associates?  He's in custody on another torture and murder, LE explains, and so they were in no real rush to clear things or to share info. with the public.  They had him in their sights early on and just waited for things to play out in terms of evidence while maintaining the appearance of an ongoing investigation?   It's also possible that LE was split on a suspect -- which you could almost discern from the second press conference -- until some piece of evidence ell into place. How would you feel knowing that LE has had someone squarely in mind almost from the beginning, but continued to promote the tip line, increase the reward, etc.?"

none,"One of the many mysteries is how BG got onto the trails and left the trails without anyone seeing him (some witnesses encountered him on the trails, but did not see him after the murders).  Another is whether the perp. acted alone.  Either way, a person or persons could have used the creek to avoid leaving footprints (except for that one pair found near the bodies) both getting into the trails and then exiting.   They could have come from upstream or downstream."
none,"I recently posted that LE should do one of two things depending on what it believes.  I was soundly lambasted for presuming that I can tell LE what it should do.  I was naively thinking that LE should want to do what's right for all the residents of Delphi and act transparently but, of course, that's not true.  So, let me tweak that post and say that in my humble opinion there are two most likely scenarios for the murders.  I'm throwing out the sketches, and not even thinking about the audio and video which has resulted in zilch for over four years.  If it is a local murderer, then common sense dictates that it would be a drug-related murder as the majority of violent crimes in Indiana are drug related.   And, IMO, that means GK and AG and friends are involved.  You can go through the alphabet soup of POIs and possible suspects and there is one thing that's missing: motive.  If we are dealing with a serial killer or someone motivated by killing or killing's sake, then that's not going to be a local.  If you are planning your kill, you plan on doing it far from home.   You can go though other locals who have been mentioned such as PB or RL or MH, and it's just hard to see how they could have decided late in life to kill someone and do it in their backyards.  The P brothers are pedophiles and criminals, and who knows, maybe LE has its eye on them, but I'll go with another incarcerated local meth-head criminal.  Remember, GK is an admitted murderer and it was about drugs and jealousy and revenge and how many murderers do have in a rural community in Indiana at one time, anyway?  And GK didn't necessarily have to be the actual killer: he would know who did what among his crew. If it is a non-local killer, and someone who has never been mentioned anywhere as a possible suspect, then LE does need to release more information and promote it broadly and mention the reward and hope for help.  LE was so smug that it would solve this crime quickly, and they didn't.  I it is because there are no local suspects, then it's time to be transparent and reach out."
none,"About two hours ago, a guy was chasing his small, frightened dog down Greenough Blvd. and the dog ran up that hill which I think is Grove Street (?).  If anyone knows, let me know."
none,"Regardless of their ineptitude up to this point, IMO there are only two courses of action that LE can take now to advance the case, and that's assuming there is no LE-wide conspiracy at a coverup which some people have mentioned.  These are based on two trains of thought:  that LE does have a local suspect or suspects or LE really has no clue and no suspects.  And based on what we've seen at the press conferences, LE could very well be divided on this, on whether they have a suspect or not.  1. If the suspected perpetrator or perpetrators is/are local and known to law enforcement  -- such as GK, Ag and/or members of their crew -- then LE needs to make the announcement even if it's not an arrest.  They need to identify a suspect or suspects, maybe explain they are incarcerated, and even explain why no arrest has been made and call the investigation ongoing.  LE does this all the time: names someone as a POI or a suspect without making an immediate arrest.  If LE is still looking for evidence to go with a strong suspect, then such an announcement might shake it loose if someone could get a deal.  And as long as the suspect makes sense and could eventually be found to be wrong, this announcement now would show that LE is doing serious work on the case which could also work in its favor as far as gathering evidence and statements goes.   2. Or, if there is no local or non-local suspect, then LE must make more information public: they must release some details about the COD and the crime scene.  They can still hold back some information, but if there are three or four signatures, then the public needs to know about two of them.  If there was an usual weapon used or left at the scene, then the public needs to know that even if they don't give an exact make and model (i.e., they could say ""unusual deer-hunting knife"" and not necessarily provide a brand and model number.   They should tell us about any clothing found at the scene -- both Abby and Libby's and how they were found in terms of dress -- and any unexplained clothing found at or near the scene.  LE doesn't need to share the complete audio if it is, in fact, a recording of the murders, but they should tell us that's what it is.Option number one would, for the most part, be a local story and keeps the whole case in the Delphi area.  Option number two would have to be a more statewide, regional and national announcement with significant mention of the reward.   Remember, option two means LE doesn't have a clue and really needs help from the public. Also, form counts so either one of these announcements would have to done professionally, maybe by a female LE officer as some here as suggested, with clear information with no confusion and nothing that has to be re-explained later."
none,"There is a lot of speculation -- some o it by me -- that LE has a POI in its sights and has yet to act because they don't have the physical evidence to get a guilty verdict, or someone has provided an alibi for the individual, or that the POI is already incarcerated thus slowing down LE actions.  In March, former Prosecutor Robert Ives was interviewed by Dr. Oz and said the following: > I just  I hope the people who are handling the investigation will consider whether perhaps it might be time to release some more of that information, so connections to other crimes in other places— or, if someone's ever spoken to the perpetrator of this crime, perhaps it would give them a clue that they had learned something from the perpetrator.   Although Ives is not currently involved in the investigation, he is a member of LE who wants to solve this crime and I just don't think he would make this recommendation to current investigators if, in fact, there was a strong suspect.  Ives' comment is indicative of a case that is far from being solved and has LE is still looking for clues."

Do you think if this was a revenge killing, it could have been a case of mistaken identity and that Kelsi could have been the intended target?"

I made sure to absorb the loss of you in every fiber of my being- sitting by your bedside, feeding you, bathing you, watching your body waste away into a vacant shell, and still embracing every present moment with you.As you faded away, I grew stronger.

Time had stopped, then suddenly, time skipped.You were always there to support me when I was in need. You know that Bible verse? I'm sure you do. You've only read the Bible a few hundred times. It goes something like, For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.”Well, I never went to prison, but for all those other things you were there for me. And you were there for others, ringing that verse true in it's entirety.I suppose in a sense you were our crutch. Our backup plan. Our constant. And now, you're gone. It all happened so fast.

But it still doesn't seem real. I sit and replay old voicemails you had left me. Singing me Happy Birthday, asking if I had made it home, telling me you love me. It's like you're a phone call away.

none,"Hello, I am C's granddaughter. Odds are if you don't know me personally, my grandmother has at least mentioned me to you ☺️ I read The pastor's portion before I wrote my own, and I was moved to tears. It was perfect. So thank you. No one could have delivered that more personally or perfectly. My mamaw adored you and your family, as well as all of you here today. In honor of the amazing woman who was my Mamaw, and mother to many, I ask we celebrate her life today rather than mourn her death. I ask that you not weep of sadness but with joy because my Mamaw still lives in each of her children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, her church congregation, and in her community.A fun fact not many know is that my Mamaw was the very first person to hold me when I was born into this world. My grandmother and I always have had a very special and unique bond. She told everyone, unashamedly that I was her favorite, and I adored her just as much as a mother and as a best friend. Because of this, I felt the need to share with you the C that I knew. To begin, she hated her middle and maiden name. She'd often recant memories of being teased for Jink's and being accused of being unable to spell her own name. In reality, she hardly had a middle school education, and as The pastor touched on, that inspired her to support the enrichment and education of her children. My Mamaw raised me since I was a child, and all my best childhood memories include her and my Papaw. Mamaw was the person who put rollers in my hair after my bath for church on Saturday nights and sewed together dresses for me to wear Sunday morning. We'd watch the Laurence Welk Show, Jeopardy, and Wheel of Fortune on Saturday and attend church every Sunday. I grew up helping my grandparents on Mamaw Farm's” horse farm in Felicity. Most of my childhood was spent playing in the backyard and helping on the farm. Once I could read, Mamaw would take me weekly to the library in town. I was the kid hiding under covers with a flashlight reading past bedtime. Whenever I was interested in a subject in school, she fostered it. She took me to piano and tennis lessons. We went to houses on the Underground Railroad, museums, the Mammoth Caves, Amish country. We would go to Knoxville and Gatlinburg, Tennessee every summer. I have so many memories of climbing rocks and having picnics in the Chimney's while trying to spy a bear. On the very same trips, we'd spend hours in cemeteries and with distant relatives as she researched her family tree. Her house is filled with binders of her family history and genealogy. Family was the most important to her, behind faith. She helped me through college and made it possible for me to study abroad. Any successes I have today are a direct result of my Mamaw. In addition to my successes, she crafted me into the person I am today. I love cooking and I inherited that from my Mamaw. She had me in the kitchen helping cook and bake from the time I was 2, the age my daughter is now. She was known throughout the county for her cakes and pies. She was always making someone a cake, pie, or if you were really lucky, a quilt. She also turned me into the die hard- football fanatic that I am today. Unless you've witnessed my grandmother jumping up from her seat and screaming at the television while watching Tennessee Volunteers Football, you haven't truly met Charlotte Broach. There was no one more special to my Mamaw than my Papaw, and when he left, a part of her left with him. I saw that part of her spark back to life with the birth of my daughter. My daughter renewed her passion to live, I've always felt, and they were both blessed with the two years they spent together. My Mamaw's greatest gifts were always through her service. In fact, the word I heard the most as I witnessed people of all ages come to say their goodbyes to her was servant.” All I can hope for is that we all follow her lead and show our love and appreciation, and honor her memory through service.To some she was Miss C., to others she was Mom, Aunt C., or the cafeteria worker from school. To me, she was Mamaw, mom, my best friend, all of the above, and I hope to live up to her legacy.With that, I would like to close with a quote as she was all of these things.A person who is truthful, charitable, forgiving, sober, kind, austere and free from hatred is one who knows the Kingdom of God.”"

My mind is racing but the thoughts are empty.My body is pacing but without direction.As I stare at the shell of your soul, a now empty vessel, I feel nothing. Not grief. Not relief. Just emptiness. I hope you enjoy spending Father's Day with Papaw. I know your soul has left it's earthly body, because I can feel it all around me. I feel your soul cloaking me with your love and I know in spirit you are still here with me.Telling me to stop my pacing."

none,"My grandmother was diagnosed in May with cancer and now has days to live. Her lawyer had her will and she also had a copy of the will, but it was stolen by a family member years ago. We went to the lawyer to review the will with my grandma and have the family member removed from the will, and the law office stated they get rid of documents after 5 years, and since the will was done in the 70s they no longer have it.They followed this up with stating the Supreme Court actually just ruled they only need to retain documentation for a year. This sounds very odd to me and there is also not a copy of the will at the courts. Is this typical for all wills? My grandma is now legally incompetent to write a will and since her copy was stolen and the lawyer destroyed the other copy, it will all go through probate."

I mean, how many other's wardrobe is mostly made of 20+ year garments? I take that back... I have some old items in mine as well..Anyway. These items will most likely never be worn again. These are winter clothes. Sweaters, sweatshirts, button down blouses.. She won't be here by winter. That's what I think about as my eyes scan over the clothing.One day she was fine. Wearing her blue blouses, quilting her quilts, beaming at her grand and great grandchildren. Then suddenly, she's frail. Her cough is a weak wheeze. Her skin is sunken. Her eyes glazed and eyelids wilted. Energy isn't existent. Cancer came fast and hard and she was defenseless..Anyway, now I'm just sitting here staring at this clothing. Some pieces older than me. Just reminiscing and reflecting on how swiftly something constant can change. Anyway, I'm so grateful I get to spend these last weeks with you, Mamaw 💙 I am so grateful for you. Even though sometimes, I have to step away and just stare at these clothes.Anyway."

Sometimes I smile and pretend life is normal.But mostly, I am busy. I'm busy making her dinner that she can't eat,Washing her body. Trying to untangle her hair and remove bandages. I'm busy cleaning the house and entertaining people who stop by, bless them.I'm busy helping her use the restroom, or chamber pot- as her strength wanes.I feel concern, exhaustion. But mostly I'm busy living in the present moment. Enjoying every moment I have. Most people aren't so lucky to spend the last weeks of their life with people they love.

none,"When I was a child, I would have ""nightmares"" where I wake up right before I die. For the past couple months, I've had a few dreams where I actually fully die. The feelings I get when i die in my dream are feelings I've never felt before. While im awake and conscious (right now) it's hard to recall just how perfect I feel after death, similar to how its hard to remember what your dream consisted of when you wake up. Im my most recent dream, all i remember was I was trying to form a relationship with this one person I adored, there was no mutuality. In the middle of the dream, she ended up injecting me with some kind of death juice. I remember feeling betrayed and sad, but not surprised. At that point forward in the dream, I knew I was going to die soon, but i didn't do anything to stop it. Towards the end of the dream I was arguing with the same person, and during the argument my body started going numb, limb by limb. My vision went blurry, my hearing started to fade, all my senses went dull, and I slowly collapsed on the floor. My view after death consisted of a soft white color, as do all my deaths in my dreams. This view is always accompanied by an extreme feeling of euphoria, unlike anything I've ever felt. I always feel a sense of very slight pressure pressing down on me. My mind seems to still be ""on"", but I always feel completely disconnected with every physical thing around me, and only connected with the feeling of nothingness. This feeling seems to last for 5 minutes or so (dream time)Summary: Death feels SO GOOD in my dreams."

none,"Im a 17 yr old male. For the past year (has nothing to do with covid i could care less about that) I have been feeling like 98% of people will never truly feel content. Im a christian and my faith is very strong, i know where im going when i die and i give all the glory to God, im content with that, im thankful for everything hes done, but i feel like life on earth is just a never ending cycle filled with disappointment and tiny glimpses of happiness.Im observant. The more i pay attention to things, the more i realize that we always have a goal in mind, once we reach that goal we aren't satisfied for long and need more. This concerns me because I know what would happen to me if i instantly became a billionaire somehow. I would end up going insane and killing myself knowing that there's nothing more to the physical world. Im starting to feel glimpses of this, because im constantly waiting for the next step in my life, knowing that once i get there it will be nothing new. I know that nothing in life matters. When people say find your own meaning in life, i just shake my head. We will no longer exist at all in 100 years. That's crazy how nothing we do right now will ever matter in the long run because death erases everything. Who cares if i fail highschool. It will all end up being ok and when i die it all will have been a waste of stressing out. Who cares if i have a bad record like wreck less driving or bad credit or debt, sure your life may be more challenging, but if you acknowledge the fact that life doesn't matter then it literally makes no difference. Once you die, nothing and i mean NOTHING matters. It doesn't matter what kind if impact you made for the future, because the same thing applies to the next generation. Nothing matters for them either. What is life. You work, get money, pay bills, work, get money, pay bills. Every enjoyed moment is very temporary. Once the moment is gone, its gone. The more enjoyment you get, the more you want, just like any drug. Soon you will need so much dopamine to feel anything that it is never reached. What would you do at that point....Its a scary thought but its true. What bothers me more is that while my conscience mind knows this to be true, my subconscious mind is locked in a state of anxiety and fear. This holds me back from doing what i want because my subconscious instinctive mind keeps telling me that it definitely is important to act a certain way, to be careful what you do or say, to feel anxiety and choose flight instead of fight, to fit in with the crowd and try to be normal and not be awkward or different. Im always watching what i say in front of others to maintain an image i want them to see. Im always bending the truth to make it appear how i want it to. Im always shaky and cowardly when i get confronted.I feel like i will never escape the vicious cycle that is life, and that my subconscious mind confines me to a person full of fear, anxiety, discontentment, and regret. Its scary when you cant even convince your mind what it is you know to be true, because you are trapped."
none,"Im trying to *k24* swap my del sol for under $3000. I know the k24a2 is the ""best"" engine for me, but where i am in the country the lowest they go for is $800. Even the junkyards. So for my scenario lets just say hypothetically ALL a2's are $800 or more. Should I spend $800 on an a2 or is it worth considering a k24a4 which i understand to be the most produced and cheapest k24s? I know they are less desirable and not as strong but 160hp and 161 torque doesn't sound half bad. Im not going to build either motor, but i probably will turbo in maybe a year or 2 if i still have the car. What is the best option for me?

Then the Game Awards 2018 came and revealed that Joker would be stealing hearts in SSBU so being a fan of SSBU I looked at a few trailers and some gameplay(not enough to spoil anything major for me though) and I thought I'd give P5 a try. Unfortunately I didn't have a PS4 at the time so I just played Joker with minimal knowledge of the game and who he is. I finally got a PS4 and the game around Christmas last year and once I beat it I realized why everyone was so hype about Joker being in SSBU. Now I LOVE the game and am currently waiting to get my hands on my copy of P5R (yes I preordered it) and am excited to go through the alternate timeline with the PT all over again! After playing the demo of P5S I can truly say that I have faith that it'll be a sequel we'll all cherish as much as we cherish P5 and P5R. So that's my P5 background!

I also play string instruments (Violin, Viola, Cello and Bass.) One other hobby besides music is gaming. I tend to do a lot of that when I have the time. Right now I'm finishing up my last year of high school and it's going pretty good. I've just never been good with talking to people in public that I'm unfamiliar with. I guess you could call that social anxiety? I'm not sure what to call it😂. Well if this post interests you then DM and we can talk."
none,"Going back through the game a few times now I've realized that Shido (to a certain degree) reminds me of the current US president. Obviously there are differences between the two since one is grounded by reality. However, I would like your opinions on what type of palace you think Trump would have.  Just a fun little discussion since we all know how infamous he is. Personally there are a lot of things I think his palace would resemble. It could be related to Shido's or maybe Kaneshiro's. But I'm curious as to what you guys think. The spoiler tag is here just in case someone hasn't finished the game yet. I've seen more people post about completing their first playthrough so just being cautious."

none,"So I have been with someone since last year and I met them through a friend. Turns out she was a major whore. She has repeatedly cheated on me for a total of SEVEN times and basically toyed with my emotions. I don't know why I'm so caring and forgiving, if I wasn't then maybe this wouldn't have happened so much but that's what I get for caring I guess. It seems like no one wants a serious relationship anymore. They just want sex and that's it. Shit like this pisses me off because there are some people who actually want a committed relationship and most people just want sex so it's hard to find someone who's actually serious about dating. That's my opinion and story. Feel free to comment below your similar experiences or advice if you have any. Thanks for listening."

none,"Now, I want to illustrate my situation well because is hard not to be judge.I connect my depression with the death of my dearest friend by cancer, when we were both teens, but maybe it could have been ""inside"" me since so much time before, because of mother-trauma related stuff.Still the fact that: I have depression. Never diagnosticated, but i don't want to appear like those teens on tiktok who says ""yeaaaah i am so depressed buuhuhu"" because they got a bad day/week. I checked all syntomphs trough years, also been through therapy some years ago and even if the psychologist didn't notice it because our conversations were focused on other things (like mother trumas, lol) this is what I feel 100% of time.I have a fiancè who is absolutly great and our relationship is going well, but I can not say the same about his family.They lead a lot of stress, problems, negative thoughts and toxic situations with them, and even if we try to don't make attention, they hit our routine CONSTANTLY, wich makes me feel even worse because of depression + stress.Also, I have a particular relationship with death and I am because I am NOT SCARED at all by it. I  I just think about death constantly, but in a good way.THE PROBLEM IS that, I am sure, if I'll go to see another therapist and tell them that I am depressed + I love the idea of death, they could instantly think about the fact that I am the classic person who is so depressed to c0mmit suicid3, but this is not what I want! And this is not what I am.See, is pretty diffucult to explain and can't find the right words. I just see death as a friend, born as something I did not wanted, a burden wich I just want to delete because it could make me so much happier, just let all the problems go away in the simpliest way.I don't want to see anyone because I KNOW for sure that they will not understand my personality and is an hard situation to pass through.

none,"Now, let me explain the situation.Idk how it works in your country, but I live in Italy and here adoptions rules are a little bit difficult. Not talking about rainbow families, but even for eterosexual couples is SO HARD to adopt a baby because social assistents, doctors, even priests or similar (sometimes) ask to the partners a lot of stuff and tests to make to see if you are ""the right parent"".Well, my bf's sister got 2 legitimate babies with her partner, so not-adopted babies but they didn't had to take any tests or similar. And ask to me ""why?"". Why they need to check if you are a good person with adopted babies and not with ""legitimate"" (idk how to define them better) ones ?She has a hard relationship and can't let her babies with alone with the partner because she doesn't trust him and this thing gets me crazy because I am an antinatalism.I love her babies and totally know that isn't their fault for anything, of course, but why make them born in a totally wrong situation?

none,"I am a freelance artist when I can find committents, but my boyfriend is unemployed.We are from Italy and here there is an aweful job situation... No one can find a job that isn't underpaid, or where you are treated almost like a slave (40h a week payed but they ask you to do maybe 50 or more but don't pay you the extras).For example,once my boyfriend has worked in an assembly line where the agency produced cleaning stuff (vacuum cleaner etc) and he was forced to use a glue that didn't touched other workers, but that caused him a strong reaction, he went to the doctor that said it was an allergic reaction and suggested him to communicate this at job.My bf did it the same day, of course, and can you imagine what happened few days later? They asked him to return in the position with the glue thing 🙃 yes, aaaaand obviously he refused to do it.See, ppl continue to say "" he doesn't want to work"" but this is just an example of how they treated him and it was just at one job! How could someone accept to be treated like this? There isn't slavery anymore, right? So why are we just numbers anyway? I feel a little more lucky than him because when I can I work from home, but I feel also so sad for him and don't know how to help him. In general we're so depressed about how is our country. Lot of ppl think that Italy is a wonderful place to live, but it isn't an covid situation has aggravated the situation! Before it was already diffucult to get a job but know is impossible and if you're a lucky enough to find one they treat you like a little piece of shit ...

She always bounced back but not today.I was with her up until her final breath, she was  surrounded by family telling her it's okay to let go. I don't know if I'm going through shock or what but I can't cry, I cried earlier today but not as much as I wanted too. Just knowing my pop is on his own now, I worry about him more so than ever, because today he lost his best friend of 60 plus years.

none,"Morning guys,I have a 16 month old that isn't well at the moment.It started yesterday morning after he woke up from his night sleep. He started off with progressively worse runny stools that lasted majority of the day. It seemed to somewhat ease off by late afternoon but I started noticing he was burping heaps as well.Just before we put him to bed he projectile vomited twice and me and my wife were anxious about it being gastro but once we calmed him down, he was fine. He was fine for a majority of the day if he didn't have the diarrhoea or the vomiting you wouldn't even notice.Me and my wife are extremely anxious people and we have no idea if it IS gastro or something he ate.I guess today will tell us what's going on but I guess I just want to know if it's normal for just the one single vomiting episode? I always thought if it happens once it'll usually happen again."

I have been suffering from hemiplegic migraines since the age of 6-7 and I'm 29 this year as well as general headaches that come and go. I've been through hell and back since I was 19 with two unrelated cancer battles (both in remission now since 2011-2012) and since then a MS scare due to white matter lesions found in my brain, however my neurologist concluded it to be from my migraines.I'm here asking for help because lately I have been getting daily headaches, it's usually on one side but it goes to and from.It starts above my eyes (eye brows) and it radiates to the back of my head and I've noticed if one day I have it on my right side it affects my right eye too, but not my left if i have a headache on the left side. Most mornings I feel fine, it settles during the night but always flares up as the day goes on, so by the afternoon I'm in a lot of pain.I made the stupid mistake of googling my symptoms and now convinced myself it's life threatening and now worrying I have something serious.It is just really getting to me and I just wanted to know if any of you guys have something similar, or have any advice?I have an mri booked but it's not for another two weeks, which sucks.Anyway that's all I have to say and I hope you all are doing well."

The company I am with now is flexible and understanding and the best I have had but this potential new job seems more reliant on me and I am worried about telling them and potentially getting a migraine on the job.It is the worst part about jobs and for some reason there's this stigma about migraines just being headaches” and i  know this will be the opinions of many. I always dread telling my managers of new jobs because I feel if you have never had one you will never understand. And I hate getting the migraines whilst working.What should I do? What's the best way to approach this? "

none,"Hey guys,I hope this is an okay place to post this sort of question because I know this may be an iffy post and I DO NOT want to start a debate, all I am after is advice.So me and my partner are planning to travel to Seoul later in the month to catch up with a good friend I made back in high school as he was an exchange student. It's only for a week or so but all this stuff that is happening overseas is kind of getting to us.We tried to ignore it, out of sight out of mind kind of thing but recently the escalations of what North Korea are planning/doing is just plain scary. We have spoken to my friend about it and he has reassured us on coming over because he stated that this sort of thing happens a lot and he has never felt in danger for the 26 years he's been there but we feel we don't know enough about what is actually going on and we are hoping for a better insight in case this trip IS a bad idea.We really don't want to cancel the trip because nothing may happen and we might not ever get the chance again, plus we might not get the money back (that's not an issue as health and safety is more important) but what would your advice/opinions be on our trip?Thank you in advance everyone."
none,"Hey guys I was recently prescribed Rizatriptan (Maxalt) from my neurologist and I just wanted to ask for your opinions on this sort of drug.I have taken one other form before but even though it ""helped"" the initial attack I got another one two days later.

I work outdoors and the jobs are quite repetitive usually bending up and down etc so with a migraine postdrome it's amplified. I think what makes it worse is I take a couple of days off usually due to the attack happening throughout one work day which always requires me to go home and then when I have the postdrome as I feel like death and have no energy I also take that day off so I can recover.I guess my main concern is that I can't shake the feeling of guilt and I always feel as if I'm overreacting.

It came with 12 months registration, 4 brand new tyres and it only has 56k on the odometer but recently I have noticed a slight smell of coolant after I have driven it for an extended period of time. The history of the car seems legit, it has log book servicing and was looked after as previously stated but I am just worried it is something serious as I have never owned a Subaru and I know nothing about them but every time I google something it always comes up inevitably with ""head gaskets"" etc etc.My coolant hasn't dropped (if it has it is very minor) as every morning when it is cold it's at full and has coolant under the cap, and after it has been running (when I notice the smell) it's above full. Any suggestions?"
none,So about 4 months ago I was getting reoccurring migraines roughly every two weeks. It was obviously unsettling because of how excruciating they are and how much they impact work/life etc.But recently I cut out high amounts of caffeine and just stuck to tea and from this I lasted almost 9 weeks without one. So last week I began drinking coffee again and to my amazement after the third day I got one.The only reason as to why I am curious is that I see a lot of articles online stating that caffeine helps migraines. So is it a trigger for anyone else?
none,"Hi there,This is my first time posting on here. I have suffered with migraines for about 16 years  it's never constant (once every 1-3 months) however recently they have been more frequent attacks (once every 2-3 weeks) I just wanted to know how effective magnesium supplements are and if there are alternatives that really work as preventatives for attacks.Also does anyone have existing long term effects from migraines such as vision problems or random head pains? I am currently in the category for MS due to an MRI last year revealing multiple lesions but I'm at a stand still with my neurologist as most of my symptoms aren't typical of MS. So if anyone has information on my issues that I have posted I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance."

I think this is one of the most beautiful videos I have seen in recent times for various reasons.The main highlight was when this one lady tells the guy -The typical male approach to women is so boring.” And then carries on to say  You are really brave to try to meet a girl in an old-fashioned way.”This video struck a chord with me. In a world of swipe right/left, I would like to find a date offline.I have talked to women in general like this, but not with a romantic angle. Doing something like this makes me feel nervous and excited. And anything that makes me feel nervous and excited, I always go for it.To all the women - What sort of things I should keep in mind while approaching someone offline?Here are few things from my side that I will keep in mind -* Only talk to the ones that catch my eye.* A no is a no. I'll conclude the conversation by saying Thank you for your time. Have a lovely day/evening ahead!” -* If a girl is interested, I would ask for a coffee/tea.* I will not ask for a date straight away as the guy did in the video. In fact, I would not ask for a date at all. I would rather ask to hang out. Guess that takes the pressure away.* I'll be honest in the entire conversation.* I definitely won't be creepy.Even for a guy like him (tall and handsome), it was difficult. So am sure it will be more difficult for me (brown guy, 172 cm). But no fun, without difficulties."

These came with the template I bought. Now I am looking to add two more filters - ""Experience"" and ""Location"".

While Location would be checkboxes with values North America, India, and Europe (these are the geographical locations I want to focus on initially.)I tried, but within webflow, I couldn't find a way to do this. Upon research, I found jetboost (which is paid). I tried that too, but I think am doing something wrong.I went through the tutorials on wefblow, but it didn't help.This is literally the last thing I need to do and then I can go live. I am unfortunately not a coder, and so am facing a tough time getting these filters.Can someone please help? It would be appreciated a lot. And maybe I can help you with something.

Yesterday, I went to learn to skateboard on my own for the first time. And as dumb as I can get, I did not have protection except my helmet. Just when I started gaining confidence, I fell down on my wrist. The impact was good enough.I came back home to see swelling on my wrist.It didn't pain too much back then, but now I can't bend my hand from the wrist area (think about the position of my hand while doing pushup position). It pains a lot while I do that. I waited till today evening to see how it is, but the swelling is still there along with the pain.I don't think it's a fracture or anything, but I decided not to go for burpees today. I anyways can't do it because it's paining. My gut feeling says I should rest for 2-3 days because doing anything that has even a small impact on the wrist can make it worse.So, unfortunately, even though being so close to 21 days, I'm afraid I will quit.But while I quit, I have decided that I will start all over again in 3 days.I feel terrible right now. But I know it's a part and parcel of life."

none,"Hello,I have been working on a side project for the last 2 weeks. It's a job portal for a niche market. I want to finish it at the end of this week. However, I'm stuck almost at the last point. I'm using webflow. I've ""categories"" and ""featured companies"" as filters. These came with the template I bought. Now I am looking to add two more filters - ""Experience"" and ""Location"". Experience will be a drop-down with values Entry Level, Senior, Mid-level, and Senior. While Location would be checkboxes with values North America, India, and Europe (these are the geographical locations I want to focus on initially.)I tried, but within webflow, I couldn't find a way to do this. Upon research, I found jetboost (which is paid). I tried that too, but I think am doing something wrong. I went through the tutorials on wefblow, but it didn't help. This is literally the last thing I need to do and then I can go live. I am unfortunately not a coder, and so am facing a tough time getting these filters.Can someone please help? It would be appreciated a lot. And maybe I can help you with something. And yes, though am on a tight budget but if it's really needed, I can pay for your help. Thank you."

Not that am proud of it, but that's my Berlin special story.If you are new to Berlin, I can show you some cool places.

I'm looking for a woman with whom I can go on dates in Greece, travel from Auckland, Newzealand to Seville, Spain, have sex in the Amazon forest, deep kisses at the Eiffel tower, and watch open-air movies in Peru. I want someone who is genuinely good at heart and is interested to know more about me. I'm way more than what's written in this post.**How do I look like?**  [Me](https://imgur.com/hPt9nRo)**What's next?**  If any of the above points resonated with you, please take a chance and hit me up (chat/message). If we both feel like it, we can move to WhatsApp or telegram. And if things click, I definitely will travel to any part of the world to see you.*PS: If you reached this point of the post, I thank you from the bottom part of my heart. You decided to spend 10 mins of your life reading my thoughts and that's a big deal for me. I wish you a wonderful day/evening ahead.*"

none,"What do you think happens when we die, Keanu Reeves?"", asked Stephen Colbert during one of his episodes of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.Keanu Reeves took a pause, followed by a deep breath. He answered, ""I know that the ones who love us will miss us.""I watched this video clip sometime last year when Italy was going through a tough phase because of Coronavirus. I was amazed by Keanu's answer back then. This clip appeared on my YouTube feed again a few days back. And this time it made me cry. It made me cry because this time I experienced what Keanu said.My father passed away on April, 27th, 2021. He was Corona positive, along with my entire family. We all recovered, but he took his last breath after being in the ICU for 21 days. I went to India on March 18th, since the Corona numbers were low (I live and work in Berlin). I didn't see my family for more than a year so I thought it would be nice to see them after a long time. But few days after I landed there, the numbers started increasing exponentially. I was infected along with the family. But my dad being a little old, had to be hospitalized.While getting him admitted, I saw 3 dead bodies lying outside the ICU. It shook me inside out. I have seen a dead body before, but I don't know. This time it was different. I saw people crying. I saw people being completely helpless.But little did I know, that I would be in a similar situation.My dad was in the ICU and he being Corona positive, we were not allowed to get inside. We had a couple of video calls with him. And in the last video call, he was crying. I didn't know what could I do to save him. A day later, he was kept on a ventilator (from this state, recovery is minimal). A couple of days later, he passed away.I don't know what sort of pain he was in. I don't know if he wanted to say anything to the family. I just couldn't do anything. Like my father, millions lost their lives in India in a span of 20-25 days, and don't know how many lost their lives during the entire Corona period. I'm back in Berlin. Usually, whenever I come back my entire family comes to see me off. Everyone was there this time, except my dad. I don't think I can relate to anything more than what Keanu said that day.I miss you, dad."

But the horrifying story doesn't end here. My dad was working in PWD, Electrical division (Gujarat). It comes under the state government. I've been trying to get his pension transferred to my mom's account since 14th May, but in vain. 14th May - I went to the pension office. They asked me to submit a death certificate and a form and told me to come back 10 later.25th May - I went to check what are the next steps, which they didn't tell me earlier. The responsible person was absent that day.2nd June - I went. The responsible person gave me a couple of forms and told me to come back for a document review. 4th June - I went. And now the person told that the documents are not sufficient. The main problem is, my dad had a surname change in 2019. Now we do have a couple of documents that say the surname change has happened, but the person said that these are not the ones that he is looking for. He also didn't mention what exactly the document is and from where I can get it. He just said I can find it from Gandhinagar's office. Now I am completely lost. I have no idea what to do. Please, it's a humble request, if someone has any tips, it would be of great help. PS : I can share more details in a private message if needed."

And start projects that I always wanted to and bring them to the finish line. My profile is pretty wide: product management, writing, video creation, and DJing. And I want to move into all these four domains and start monetizing my skills. I'm also researching the topic of passive income and how can I start working on these. I'm looking for 1 to max 5 buddies to keep track of ourselves. My idea is to have a weekly call/chat where we talk about our weekly goals and what we did or will do to achieve them.

From his fashion style to his video-making ability, his thoughts, and of course story-telling, everything touches me deep inside. And I've learned a lot from him over a period of years.I am an Indian living in Berlin. I work as a product manager in Europe's one of the biggest fashion e-retailers. I also did a project where I did 100 things (like learning calligraphy, sign language, fruit art, etc) for 100 days and made 100 videos. I did this with my job. I also run 5K every day and try to be a hard worker where possible. This is not to imitate Casey, but to seek inspiration from him and do things with my own thoughts and my own style.A few weeks back my dad passed away. And I'm witnessing chaos since then. I wanted to extend my project to 365 days but had to stop at Day 102 because I along with my family got Covid positive. Everyone recovered except my dad.Since then my life has turned upside down. I don't have the strength to restart the project. And I definitely don't like my current work.At this point, I neither have my work sorted out nor do I have love (this is very opposite to Casey's life).Time and again I think about what would Casey have done in this situation. But I know this is my situation and I need to do it my way.Thank you Casey though, to keep my flame alive. (with moist eyes)"
none,"**Note**: **I really don't know how to explain my situation, but I will try.**I'm an average-looking, but full of charm and passion, 33-year-old Male. From playing badminton at the national level to getting a job offer from Europe's one of the biggest fashion e-retailers after applying to 72 companies and giving 123 interviews, I consider myself as an underdog. Time and again, I have surprised myself in terms of achieving juggernaut milestones.But there is one thing where I have terribly failed and been unlucky - finding love.I never felt comfortable with the arranged marriage thing, even though I personally know stories about married couples. I feel that marriage is a huge life-changing event and I want to decide by myself whom I would get married to. I still agreed to meet girls within the community (because my parents wanted me to) but didn't find anyone with whom I could even think of anything like marriage.I realized that I also had to take the responsibility of finding love since I claimed that arrange marriage wasn't my thing. And so I did but also went with the flow. After umpteen attempts, I still haven't been able to find love. I have had my share of flings and even dated a few women in Europe (I live in Berlin as of now). But somewhere down the line, things haven't been the way they should. Talking about Europe, I realized that folks don't even believe in marriages. And most of the women I met, were never interested in getting married. While being in Europe, I was away from India and so nothing cooked up on this side of the world.Dad passed away recently and he wanted me to get married. The guilt currently is huge and my heart aches that just because of me, he couldn't see me getting married.With dad being no more, I started using [shaadi.com](https://shaadi.com). I don't know how far will I go with this, but yes, if you have any feedback or suggestion, am all ears. Just please be polite since am already not feeling well because of the entire situation."

none,"For most periods of my life, I've been a lazy dude having multiple ideas but with failed executions. I've always identified myself as a jack of all and master of none. That's because I love doing different things. The freshness of doing different/new things gives me a lot of joy.But in a world where expertise and mastery in a particular domain gives you more knowledge, I found myself questioning my worth more often than not. This seriously impacted my confidence and made me feel disappointed umpteen times. I started to underestimate myself most of the time.I want to highlight one thing though - whenever I am genuinely interested in something, I do it with my full heart. An example was when in 2017 I decided to leave India and started looking for a job abroad in order to experience how life is on other planets (I never traveled outside India till that point). Coming from a middle-class family and with an education from a mediocre university, I found myself struggling during the interviews. But after applying to 72 companies and giving 123 interviews, I finally got an offer at Europe's one of the biggest fashion e-retailers. I took the offer and shifted to Berlin, which is my home since then.But again, most periods of my life have been mostly about despair and failed projects. Until very recently.In mid-December 2020, I thought to do something about this entire thought that I don't want to stick to one thing and instead do multiple things and have multiple experiences. So, I started a project ""Aniket's Daily Mini-Series"", where I did one new thing every day and made a video about it. Quite literally. I did this along with my 9-6 job.I initially set a goal of doing 100 new things in 100 Days and make 100 videos about it. For the first time ever, after getting that job offer in 2017, I was able to accomplish my project. Within these 100 days, I learned umpteen things such as sign language, fruit art, writing on rice, folding a t-shirt in 3 seconds, drawing using coffee, and had some amazing experiences such as taking my first cold water dip and running a half marathon without practice. There were times when I slept for 5 hours because I had to edit videos. Magically, this project shot my confidence up. I even started running 5K every day, ate healthily, stopped frequent fapping, and just, in general, made me happy. It was a very different sort of happiness.On the 50th Day, I decided something crazy. I decided to pursue this for 365 days. I didn't announce this, but I told to myself, ""This is it Aniket. This project supports your philosophy of doing different things and you are having fun. Take this ahead.""But I didn't know things would change exactly on the 100th day.On day 100, I was tested Covid positive along with my entire family (I went to India for a small vacation since I hadn't seen my family in a long time. But a few days later, there was a huge spike in Corona numbers). Almost everyone in my family recovered except my dad. He passed away on April 27th after being in the ICU for 21 days.The situation in India was scary and horrifying. I had to stop pursuing the project which was the only ray of hope for me.And here I am now. Back to square one. I don't have the energy to restart the project at least as of now.But this is a reference post for me.I'm restarting my life again. For my family, for my dad who is up there, for the sorrow, my loved ones went through. And for myself.I'm learning to build multiple revenue sources, changing habits, and might even restart my project. But one thing is for sure, I will change my life from this point.I will come back to this post on May 14th, 2022 to check how far I've come."

I can't process the fact that he won't wear his clothes that are lying in the wardrobe and he won't sleep on his bed that is empty now. Adding to this, the entire social media is making me emotional. Especially after reading about a guy who sang Tera mujhse hai pehle ka nata koi”  on a video call to his mother who later passed away and watching a video of a young girl in a hospital who asked the doctor to listen to a song.

none,"Sorry for the typo in the subject. It's *master.—————————————————————I'm an Indian, living in Berlin. I work for a fashion company (one of the biggest fashion e-retailers) as a product manager.A few weeks back, my dad passed away (if you are following the news, you might know the situation here in India).Since his death, I've realized that I need to step up in terms of the entire money game. I want to provide my mom and the rest of my family, the best of their lives. And I believe earning extra money can help.I have a decent income in Germany, but I'm looking for ways to generate multiple income sources.The problem is, I honestly don't have a specific skill set. Yes, I'm a product manager, but it's not a profession I enjoy. What I enjoy, is doing different things. This is opposite to what people say, that I should focus on a niche.As an example of ""I like doing different things"", I started a Youtube channel in December 2020, where I posted about me learning or experiencing one new thing every day. I did 100 new things in 100 days and made 100 videos. Within these 100 days, I learned umpteen things such as sign language, fruit art, writing on rice, folding a t-shirt in 3 seconds, drawing using coffee, and had some amazing experiences such as taking my first cold water dip and running a half marathon without practice. I did all this with my 9-6 job. I wanted to do this for 365 days, but unfortunately, my dad passed away (and I was Covid positive along with my family).  So I had to stop the project.Now the thing is, I really don't have a very specific skillset to build something on. Is there anyone who could guide me. I feel am in a tunnel that is super long and don't know when will I see the light.I see people posting about crypto, affiliate marketing, blogging, and whatnot. At one point I'm inspired, but then I also find myself lost in this entire world of generating passive income.PS : One thing I recognized while writing this is, I do like the entire video-making process (from ideation, scripting, shooting, and editing). There were cases where I spent 8 hours editing. But I don't know if I will get back to it. :("

Honestly, I still can't believe that I lost him. Just a few days back, I was with him and we were talking.I don't want to go into detail as to what all happened with my dad, but all I can say is he could have easily lived a few more years if the government had a hawk-eye on the Corona numbers and had prepared accordingly. But I think expecting any sensible thing from Modi and his government is impractical.I want to keep him away from power in 2024. What I, as a citizen of India, can do for the next 3 years, so that he doesn't come back. Of course not voting for him is one thing, but am looking for concrete and practical ideas that can help me. I know it's tough, and a juggernaut task, but I want to do anything that I can.Please help."
none,"I'm very fond of Piku. I have watched it umpteen times, simply because the relationship between Bhaskor and Piku was very similar to mine with my father. I loved Bhaskor's character. Old, grumpy, and childish. Very similar to my father.This scene of Piku is probably most closest to my heart. The way Shoojit Sarcar has shown death in this scene was something very different to me. I have always seen death as painful (in movies and once in real). But when the Sarod theme comes in as soon as Piku realizes that Bhaskor is no more, just felt divine. When I saw the scene for the first time, I prayed that whenever death comes, it should be this way. Peaceful.Unfortunately, the real lives are very different from reel lives.My father, who was very similar to Bhaskor, passed away. But unlike Bhaskor's death, my father's was painful.I'm an Indian, living in Berlin.I couldn't see my family last year because of the virus (as such I visit them once a year). So this year, when things looked okay in January in terms of the Corona numbers, I decided to visit my family in March.It was wonderful seeing them after more than 1 year. I reached on March 17th, 2021.On April 1st, my younger sister complained about fever and headache. She got tested and was found Corona positive (not because of me). A day later, my father started having fever, followed by me. We all were tested positive.My mom and elder sister lost their tastes a few days later, but that was it for them. No other symptoms.In this entire scenario, my dad's oxygen level dropped to 85. This was frightening for me since the doctor said that a healthy oxygen level is about 94.I told my elder sister about this. We called multiple hospitals but in vain. Finally, we were able to find one.A few days later at the hospital, the doctor found blood in his cough. That is when he was shited to the ICU.The doctor said to us ""He is in a critical situation and might need a ventilator. But if that happens, I won't be able to help, because all of our ventilators are at use currently.""This shook me inside out. I and my elder sister started calling multiple hospitals again. This time, we were looking for a hospital bed with a ventilator.After 6 hours of trial, we finally shited him to a different hospital with a ventilator.My dad was there in the ICU for 21 days.And last week, April 27th, he passed away.But there are few things that are still bothering me -* I never said to him, but I did love him. Somehow, it never came out in words.* The last time I talked with him, was on a video call. Because we were not allowed to enter the ICU. On the call, he was crying with his two folded hands. I could feel his pain. And I still couldn't do anything about this.* He wanted me to get married. Unfortunately, this didn't happen and I feel guilty about this.* When I went to the ICU to collect his dead body, I felt that even if you are the strongest person in the world, physically and mentally, it's extremely difficult to come out of that room. All the patients are having these crazy masks, some are breathing heavily, and there is absolutely nothing to do over there apart from just lying on the bed. I don't know what all he was thinking for the 21 days. I don't know what were his last thoughts. I can't stop thinking about it. I do understand that all this does not make sense now, but I feel pathetic.However, I want to point out that he had two amazing traits - * He was absolutely fearless. And am not talking about theoretical fearlessness. He was physically and mentally fearless. I've quite a few incidents where he showed me how fearless he was. * He was great at fostering relationships. Right from the new trash picker, to the nearby Kirana shop folks, to neighborhood kids, and most of the building residents asked for him every day while he was at the hospital. He had great relationships with everyone, irrespective of who that person was. I don't know what happens after a person dies. Some say, that the person takes a rebirth straightaway, some say that the person converts into a star, some say that the soul is set free. But all I want to say is that he will always be in my heart. PS: For the first time ever, this country doesn't feel like home anymore. https://preview.redd.it/5ykvdxc4n3x61.jpg?width=1124&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3204e71b9a69e7859ac02a7fd48af7e13eb69e2"

none,"Hallo Berlin,I started a project ""Aniket's Daily Mini Series"" in mid-December, 2020. Under the project, I do or learn something new everyday and make a video about it. These are mostly the things I always wanted to do, but somehow couldn't. So 2021, I decided to not let go any single day. To date, I've finished 68 days consistently.In the last 68 days, I removed my fear of dogs, learned sign alphabets, took a cold water dip in a Berlin lake, ran a half marathon without practice, learned basic Origami, learned to bake a cake, and tons of other super cool stuff. And all this in dark cold winter and along with my 9-6 job. It has been a very tough ride, but also extremely fruitful. Of course this is just the start and I have tons of things to improve.Most of the videos I made were actually indoors (for obvious reasons). And these were all short videos. But the idea was to learn a new editing technique or a new way of filming via every video. But now since the sun is shining bright, I would like to start making proper videos. These would be more like Vlogs.This weekend I am gonna go to a kid's playground. Being an adult, I don't remember when was the last time I swung and even sat on that slide. So the idea is to relive my childhood. Likewise, I have quite a bit of idea to do outdoors. And I now want to involve others too in my video. I do have friends but via these videos, I would also be able to meet new people. Hence am more inclined towards collaborating with new people.Please ping me or drop a comment here and I would be happy to chat.My YouTube - [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvRy9PIMciQXaJoS1bvryDQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvRy9PIMciQXaJoS1bvryDQ)My Instagram - [https://www.instagram.com/aniketdailyminiseries/](https://www.instagram.com/aniketdailyminiseries/)https://preview.redd.it/ka8rpdn4eok61.png?width=402&format=png&auto=webp&s=799b18230ec846fef71fcd10a14c8491063d863f"

I went through tons of tutorials that suggested to delete media cache, increase RAM for premier pro, create proxies, and what not.

This is so bad, that the tool lags so much for these videos."
none,"Buonasera, io non credo in generale nel sovrannaturale, quindi non credo che esista un Dio o molteplici divinità, così come non credo nelle varie forme di divinazione come astrologia, lettura delle carte da gioco o tarocchi, lettura della mano, e nella chiaroveggenza.Tuttavia mi riservo il diritto di cambiare idea, nel caso in cui mi venisse dimostrato il contrario di ciò in cui credo, per fare un esempio molto semplice: una serie di previsioni precise, circoscritte, sul mio futuro che poi si avverano veramente, oppure qualcuno che, in un ambiente controllato, sia in grado di dirmi qualcosa di me, o della mia vita, che altrimenti non avrebbe potuto sapere.Allo stesso modo, se ricevessi una dimostrazione, anche personale, dell'esistenza di un Dio, o di una divinità in generale, sarei disposto a cambiare idea, anche se non saprei bene descrivere quale tipo di dimostrazione mi servirebbe; banalmente penso, forse, alla classica visione, o al classico sogno, dove una figura sovrannaturale mi parla e mi rivela qualcosa, ma anche un ipotetico sogno premonitore potrebbe aprire dei dubbi in me.Per voi invece quale potrebbe essere l'avvenimento in grado di scuotere le vostre convinzioni e, se non direttamente farvi convertire ad una religione, quantomeno mettere seriamente in discussione le vostre posizioni?Vi è mai capitata una cosa del genere?Se invece vi siete proprio ""convertiti"" sarebbe interessante se raccontasse la vostra esperienza."

none,"Non so se state seguendo gli sviluppi in arrivo dalla regione sabauda, ma c'è qualcosa che regala degli spunti secondo me interessanti, uno in particolare, la salvaguardia dei posti di lavoro.Una breve premessa.Nel 2016 viene promulgata dal Consiglio Regionale la [Legge 9/2016](http://www.regione.piemonte.it/sanita/cms2/component/phocadownload/category/234-contrasto-al-gioco-d-azzardo.html) per il contrasto al gioco d'azzardo patologico.

Ovvero, i posti di lavoro devono essere tutti tutelati? Anche a fronte di posti di lavoro che causano, o possono potenzialmente causare, un danno alla collettività? Il discorso si può fare per diversi impieghi le cui attività sono principalmente un danno per la società, come il gioco d'azzardo, escludendo forse il gioco d'azzardo da ricchi che si pratica nei casinò, penso principalmente al gioco d'azzardo, definiamolo ""accessibile"", come lotterie, lotto, Superenalotto, giochi elettronici, gratta e vinci, gioco d'azzardo digitale, ma anche produttori e commercianti di prodotti a base di tabacco e alcolici.Voi cosa ne pensate?"
none,"Apro questo thread perché mi piace discutere di queste cose, e confrontarmi e ascoltare i punti di vista di altre persone lo trovo utile per ampliare il mio approccio alla vita.Tutti abbiamo una nostra etica, moralità ed i nostri princìpi, per voi cosa ha formato, nel corso della vostra vita, questo vostro aspetto.Io non ho mai studiato filosofia, considero le religioni una specie di filosofia spicciola, accessibile, visto che sono ateo e non credo nel sovrannaturale, e so che alcuni concetti etici e morali espressi dalle religioni erano già stati espressi da filosofi secoli prima, e devo ammettere, più di quanto vorrei farlo, che avendo ricevuto un'educazione cattolica, forse un filo più severa della media, mi accorgo di applicare alcuni precetti biblici, per esempio la modestia nell'apparire e nella vita in generale, l'avversione per l'esibizionismo, la tendenza ad essere corretto, l'obbedienza alle autorità, la tendenza a dire la verità.Tuttavia, mi sono anche accorto che le esperienze della vita mi hanno portato a cambiare, se qualche anno fa cercavo di essere corretto con tutti, adesso parto dal presupposto che sono tutti stronzi e devono dimostrarmi di meritarsi la mia correttezza, di fatto oggi ripago con la stessa moneta, e, onestamente, ho preso meno fregature dalle persone applicando questo modo di fare.Mi rendo conto di essere diventato più egoista, però applico ancora una certa morale ai rapporti con le persone; faccio un esempio stupido, se mi rendo conto di piacere ad una ragazza, e per piacerle intendo al punto che lei vorrebbe avere una relazione con me, ma io non sono interessato, allora volutamente mi allontano, questo per evitare che si affezioni, o si faccia delle illusioni, e poi possa soffrire in un momento successivo. Ho notato, sempre riguardo a questo caso specifico, che non è una cosa così diffusa, molte persone fingono interesse per avere in cambio favori o sesso, infischiandosene dei sentimenti dell'altra persona e di come potrà sentirsi una volta che verrà rifiutata, personalmente applicando questo modo di fare ho perso alcune opportunità, ma mi sento meglio con me stesso, so di aver deluso qualcuna allontanandomi, ma so anche che ha sofferto meno di quanto non avrebbe sofferto se avessi accettato di protrarre la frequentazione.Mi rendo anche conto che sono piuttosto rigido sui miei princìpi, e tendo ad allontanare facilmente, velocemente e senza dare nuove opportunità, le persone che non sono in linea con la mia visione delle cose.Mi incuriosisce sapere, essendo in Italia, quanti di voi, ormai tendenzialmente adulti, si sentono ancora influenzati dalla dottrina morale cattolica, o magari se hanno scoperto altre religioni, o filosofi, o scrittori, o anche semplicemente le esperienze che ognuno di noi fa, che invece vi hanno mostrato un modo diverso di vedere le cose."
none,"Hi, I'm considering subscribing to a VPN for torrenting, and AceStream, but I'm quite confused, especially regarding speeds.At the moment I'm just using Proton free for browsing, I was considering upgrading, but they don't have any P2P server in my country, so I'm afraid the speed loss would be too high, even though my location is not too far from countries where they do have P2P servers, I think that being closer would bring more speed.I've identified a few providers that allow P2P, have servers near my location, are not under the jurisdiction of 5, 9 and 14 eyes countries, are in my price range, use WireGuard, keep no logs and allow my preferred payment method:* NordVPN;* *~~Mullvad (14 Eyes)~~*;* IVPN;* Surfshark;What are your opinions regarding those providers? Are there other providers that I should check out?I've also read about port forwarding.

none,"Apro il thread per cercare di chiarirmi un po' le idee su questa tecnologia e i relativi servizi.Raramente, forse mai, mi è capitato di vedere un prodotto le cui informazioni disponibili sono così pesantemente inflazionate dal marketing che le aziende stesse mettono in giro. Moltissimi siti di recensioni sono di fatto degli infomercial da parte dei gestori, è piuttosto difficile trovare recensioni indipendenti e approfondite, in particolare per quanto riguarda le prestazioni.Per quanto riguarda il fatto delle politiche di zero log, alcune VPN si sono sottoposte a degli audit di terze parti per confermare o meno queste dichiarazioni.Praticamente qualsiasi VPN pare offrire le stesse caratteristiche, è difficilissimo provare se quelle dichiarazioni siano o meno mendaci. Da quello che ho capito avrebbe senso utilizzare una VPN per:* accedere a contenuti bloccati in una determinata area geografica o in una rete;* offuscare il proprio traffico Internet;* utilizzare il protocollo P2P senza permettere l'identificazione del proprio IP;* utilizzare reti Wi-Fi pubbliche, o anche quella del proprio datore di lavoro, senza permettere che il gestore di quella rete possa monitorare il traffico Internet;Rispetto a TOR ha il vantaggio della velocità e il fatto che si applica a tutti i protocolli - penso si possa fare anche utilizzando TOR, ma con TorBrowser si nasconde solo la navigazione sui siti -.Alcuni siti o servizi bloccano, o rendono difficoltosa, la connessione tramite VPN, mi sembra che Netflix ed Apple Music lo facciano ma non ne sono certo.Anche se parliamo di P2P non penso si stia infrangendo il regolamento, si parla solo di due tecnologie e non delle applicazioni specifiche o illegali, né si stanno fornendo indicazioni su come reperire eventuali contenuti protetti da diritto d'autore.Io utilizzo ProtonVPN, versione gratuita, si possono utilizzare solo alcuni server e, quelle volte che l'ho usata, non ho notato particolari perdite di velocità - con TOR sono molto più evidenti - ma alcuni siti mi hanno chiesto il CAPTCHA per accedere.E' un po' di tempo che medito sulla possibilità di abbonarmi, o a Proton oppure ad altre, ma non ho mai preso una decisione in merito.Voi utilizzate delle VPN? Perché avete scelto di abbonarvi ad un servizio VPN? Come avete scelto il vostro attuale provider e come vi trovate?"

none,"After watching the evolution of The Fiend I've started pondering about what place supernatural characters have in Professional Wrestling.I of course know that one of the greatest of all time, The Undertaker, had plenty of supernatural elements, but I don't know if it's because the execution of those elements was better, or if it was that I grew up watching it and it felt more organic, but I'm finding myself having strong opinions about the direction of The Fiend.At the debut of the character I thought The Fiend was a persona that a deranged Bray Wyatt created - I don't know if there's a psychiatric disorder that makes people impervious to pain, I'm not a psychiatrist - and I accepted that, it made sense, Bray Wyatt, as a character, probably has some kind of mental disorder and he channeled his thoughts into this alter ego.But over the last few months, especially after they added Alexa Bliss, I've started questioning the direction WWE took with this character, it might be due to the fact that I personally find Alexa's performances as being poor, she looks like a teenager that just discovered heavy metal and horror movies and she's trying to scare her parents.Maybe it's just the execution of this whole story that to me looks cheesy, something out of a 90s b-movie, especially Alexa throwing a fireball to Randy Orton, and it's making me question the legitimacy of supernatural elements in Professional Wrestling.Do you think that it's just because I don't find this story as organic or as making any sense, or do you think that supernatural characters and supernatural elements don't have a place in today's Professional Wrestling?"
none,"E' una domanda che mi è venuta in mente in questo periodo in cui si parla sia della nuova politica sulla privacy di WhatsApp, sia dell'opposizione che molti sviluppatori stanno manifestando nei confronti delle mosse di Apple atte a limitare il tracciamento dei dati sui dispositivi con iOS, e aggiungerei anche MacOS visto che Safari ha una funzione per impedire la profilazione da parte dei tracker.Sappiamo che innumerevoli servizi che usiamo sono gratuiti proprio perché pagati dalla pubblicità, pubblicità che più è basata sui dati, quindi più mirata, più può far guadagnare le piattaforme.Quindi, mi chiedo, se per qualche motivo non fosse più possibile raccogliere dati - sia dati personali, che di utilizzo e comportamentali -, ad esempio in seguito ad accorgimenti tecnici che lo impediscano o a leggi che lo vietino, per quali dei servizi, siti o software che oggi utilizzate gratuitamente sareste disposti a pagare? Per pagare penso che sia più ipotizzabile un abbonamento piuttosto che un unico pagamento come si faceva una volta coi programmi.Posto che è vero che l'acquisizione di dati serve anche a migliorare il prodotto, la mia domanda ipotizza che quei dati non si possano più né vendere a terzi, né utilizzare a scopi pubblicitari.Io personalmente sicuramente pagherei per il motore di ricerca di Google, per un servizio e-mail (in teoria, avendo un abbonamento a Microsoft365, starei in un senso già pagando per la versione premium di un servizio che è offerto anche gratuitamente), per un navigatore satellitare e servizi di messaggistica istantanea come WhatsApp, e pagherei anche per Wikipedia."

A short premise, I'm not monitoring the temperatures, rather, I'm basing my observation on what I can feel, I don't think people are going to stare at a temperature widget all day long.Yes, **the 2020 MacBook Air gets hot** and, in my view, **more than it should**.As long as you're using it to create a document in Pages, while listening to Apple Music, you don't really feel it - don't get me wrong, **it does get warm, but not too much** \- but, throw in some light web browsing - and by light I mean news sites, plain sites, not fancy, graphical intensive sites - and, while using it on your lap, you can definitely feel the bottom of the computer getting warm. I haven't tried Microsoft Office but, I guess, the results won't be any better.**1080p YouTube streaming in Safari** gets the bottom **distinctively warmer** in a very short time - Apple TV+ is somewhat easier on the machine, as the bottom doesn't get as warm - Amazon Prime Video in Safari has the same effect as YouTube, I haven't tried any other browser but I guess it won't be any better than Apple's own software.**Video calls is a field where this machine does not excel at all**, I was having a videochat in Skype and the fan started running at full speed as soon as the videochat started, it stayed that way independently of the number of participants, at some point we were just 2 people, then we were 5, and the fan kept running at full speed for the whole videochat, it stopped running as soon as the chat ended, the fan, however, was definitely audible, **the noise was able to bypass the AirPods Pro's noise cancellation**.The bottom **rarely gets uncomfortably hot, but sometimes it does**, especially during 1080p video streaming in Safari, the keyboard and palm rest don't get as warm though, it's usually clearly noticeable.I think this is something you should keep in mind if you're going to use this Mac on your lap a lot. Of course I do know that using a laptop on a soft surface decreases its heat management capabilities but, on the other hand, I think that a 1,279 € machine should not get this warm performing such simple tasks.**Battery Life**I'd say **battery life is average** for a machine in this price range, albeit **on the lower end**.

none,"Hi, in June I've started using a 2020 MacBook Air and I'm progressively abandoning my Windows 10 laptop, the Mac allows me to work more comfortably, it has a vastly superior trackpad, so I don't have to use a mouse, and a much better keyboard, also, having an iPhone is just more convenient for several things.I have an Office365 Personal subscription with the full Office suite installed on my Windows laptop and 1TB on OneDrive, that I use for documents and photos storage, I'm also using OneDrive on the Mac.However I'm finding myself using iWork more than Office, I don't have to to do particularly complicated projects, so Pages is fine for me and I actually find it easier than Word, it's also easier to create more visually appealing documents in Pages than Word.One problem I have is that I work with other people that require me to create Word documents and, while it's fine for plain text, there are compatibility issues when I add visual elements.So, I'm wondering what I could do about it, I don't know if the Office Web Apps would suffice or if it would make sense to keep the Office365 subscription, or upgrade it in order to install Office both on Windows and on the Mac.Another question regards cloud services, since I'm mostly using Apple devices it would make sense to switch from OneDrive to iCloud, but I wouldn't want to pay for two subscriptions, I'm also considering a personal cloud solution like Western Digital's My Cloud Home for documents and photo storage. One advantage that I have with OneDrive, though, is that it would allow for much easier collaboration.So, what do you guys suggest for my situation? I could keep Office on the Windows laptop and use it only when I need to share files, and use Pages and save to PDF when I don't need collaboration, but I would be limited to be working at a desk because my Windows laptop has a crappy battery life and inferior trackpad, or I could uninstall Office from the Windows laptop and move it to the Mac, even though I'd be losing Publisher that I still sometimes use to create flyers and other promotional materials.I'm kinda lost :/"

none,"**\*\*\* DISCLAIMER: THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL ADVICE. I AM NOT A DOCTOR. IF YOU HAVE A FISSURE, OR HEMORRHOIDS, OR ANY KIND OF SYMPTOM (RECTAL BLEEDING, PAIN), PLEASE GO SEE A DOCTOR ASAP! \*\*\*****What is an anal fissure?**Anal fissures are small cuts in the skin of the anal canal. Fissures can be **acute**, they are considered acute during the first 4 weeks since the onset, if a fissure failed to heal naturally after 4 to 6 weeks it usually turns **chronic**. Acute fissures are easier to heal than chronic ones.**What causes anal fissures?**Most fissures are caused by **some kind of trauma**. Constipation with hard, dry stools can cause anal fissures. Anal sexual practices without proper lubrication, and/or foreplay aimed at relaxing the sphincter muscles, can lead to anal fissures, so does a partner with improperly groomed fingernails.In women the effort of childbirth can lead to the formation of anal fissures.While anal fissures caused by trauma usually develop posteriorly, a fissure situated in an **abnormal** **position**, such as anterior or lateral fissures, can be the consequence of an **IBD** (Inflammatory Bowel Disease), such as colitis and Crohn's disease.**What is muscle hypertonia?**The majority of fissures caused by trauma are usually associated with muscle hypertonia, a term that refers to the spasticity and rigidity of muscles, in other words a muscle with hypertonia is unable to contract and relax as intended.It is not clear, however, whether hypertonia is a cause or a consequence of anal fissures.In the case of anal fissures the hypertonia concerns the **internal sphincter muscle**, which is an involuntary muscles that regulates the opening and closing of the anus; a properly functioning internal sphincter muscle relaxes when passing stools and then contracts after defecation in order to ensure continence. With hypertonia the internal sphincter muscle is both spasming and constantly contracting, thus making it harder to pass stools; hypertonia also reduces the blood flow to the area making it harder to heal, the internal sphincter muscle hypertonia, which as we said leads to spasming, is the main cause of the intense pain felt with anal fissures.**What are the symptoms?**The revealing factors of a fissure usually are:* Bright red blood on the toilet paper after defecation;* Itching;* Moderate to severe stinging, burning pain both during and after defecation;* The pain after defecation can last up to several hours;* Pain while sitting;**Fissures or hemorrhoids?**Fissures and hemorrhoids can have similar symptoms such as bleeding, but it's possible to distinguish between the two conditions.The main difference between fissures and hemorrhoids is **pain**.Fissures are immediately painful while hemorrhoids, mostly internal ones, can bleed but they may not be painful.It should be noted that, both internal and external hemorrhoids, are divided into 4 grades according to severity. First grade internal hemorrhoids can bleed during defecation but are usually not painful, in the case of external hemorrhoids it is possible to feel a small lump near the anus, the lump can usually cause small discomfort if touched. Grade I hemorrhoids can be treated with Flavonoid-based oral medications, II, III and IV grade hemorrhoids require more invasive procedures.So, if the bleeding is associated with moderate to severe pain it's most likely a fissure. Hemorrhoids do become very painful as the condition progresses, but it takes time and negligence, also hemorrhoids to give earlier symptoms, whereas a fissure's onset is sudden and immediately associated with pain.**Should I see a doctor?****YES, DEFINITELY, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.**The doctor you should see is called **colorectal surgeon**.Should the colorectal surgeon identify a fissure in an abnormal location, you will be probably referred to a **gastroenterologist** in order to investigate possible underlying conditions.**How can I avoid getting anal fissures?****Diet** is the key, eating fiber-rich foods, fruits and vegetables, drinking plenty of water, limiting foods and drinks that promote constipation and irritation, should lead to soft stools and regular bowel movements.If you engage in anal sex make sure you user proper lubrication and take your time with foreplay in order to relax the muscles.**What is the proper diet if I have an anal fissure?**First, you need to learn about fibers, there are **two kinds** of fibers:* **soluble**, they make your stool softer and more lubricated, you find them in fruits (prunes, figs, bananas, berries, apples, pears and avocado) and legumes mostly (beans, peas, soy), oats, rye, barley, psyllium husk, broccoli, carrots, tubers like potatoes, root vegetables like onions, mucilage like mushrooms;* **insoluble**, these work as bulking agents, they will grow in size using water and give you that filled feeling, but they will also make your stool larger, and you find them in whole grain cereals - especially bran - dried fruits and nuts, whole grain products like bread, cakes and pasta are also rich in insoluble fibers;Stewed or boiled vegetables and lean white meat or fish is to be preferred in order to have soft stool.In order for fibers to work properly you need to drink a lot of plain **water**, ideally around 3 liters per day.**Probiotics** will also help, you can find them in milk, Greek yogurt and some kinds of cheese.**Avoid** foods and drinks that lead to constipation and irritation, like: rice, chocolate, tea, spices, eggs, alcohol, sodas, carbonated drinks.You can help yourself with **supplements**:* **Fiber** **supplements**, choose a supplement that has Psyllium husk;* **Stool softeners**, such as Lactulose;* **Laxatives**, use them only if your doctor tells you to, osmotic laxatives work best, choose a laxative that has Magnesium and/or Macrogol;**What is the treatment for anal fissures?**There are **3 kinds** of treatment for anal fissures.**Conservative** treatment, is basically changing your diet and having warm sitz baths. **If you've recently had a fissure (less than 4 weeks ago) and you're following this treatment without seeing any improvement, then go see a doctor immediately.****Medical treatment** refers to **topical medications** that you usually have to apply internally, the most common medications are:* **Ointments** that aim at reducing muscle hypertonia, such as GTN (Nitroglycerin), Nifedipine, Calcium channel blockers, therapy with this ointment lasts 4 weeks;* **Local anesthetic**, such as Lidocaine ointment;* **Anal dilators**, you use increasingly larger dilators to try to mechanically relax your sphincter muscles, therapy lasts several weeks;* **Ozone-based creams**, they can help with healing by boosting the formation of new, healthy epithelium;* **Avoid hemorrhoid medications and remedies** such as Preparation H and ice, with hemorrhoids you need to reduce blood flow to the area so that the swelling can go down, with fissures you need to increase blood flow to the area and help your muscle relaxation through heat;**Surgical treatment**:* **Botox or botox-like injections**, these injections, you usually do more than one, aim at paralyzing the internal sphincter muscle, thus promoting healing;* **Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy (LIS)**, during this procedure the surgeon will cut no less than 25% of your internal sphincter muscle's fibers, forcing the muscle to relax and heal your fissure. It's considered the gold standard of anal fissures treatment and has a success rate close to 100%, recovery is usually quick (7 to 10 days) and post surgery pain is usually just some minor discomfort, much less than the fissure pain, even the first bowel movement after surgery should be easier and much less painful than pre-surgery BMs. This procedure if performed **incorrectly** can either lead to **not healing**, because the surgeon hasn't cut enough fibers, or **permanent incontinence**, because the surgeon has cut too much, this is a risk you should be willing to take and discuss with your surgeon. It is a technically simple procedure but **it must be done by a specialized, experienced surgeon**;[My personal experience with LIS.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalFissures/comments/fj45xj/my_experience_with_anal_fissures_and_lateral/)* **Fissurectomy**, chronic fissures have calloused margins that prevent healing, the surgeon, through curettage, will remove those margins, thus letting the wound to heal itself;* **Anal stretch**, this procedure forcefully dilates your anus, it can be done manually (Lord's Operation) or with surgical instruments (Pumps, Dilagent);**What can I do for the pain?****Topical Lidocaine ointments** help by numbing the area, keeping your stool as soft and hydrated as possible, **OTC pain medications, like Ibuprofen and Paracetamol**, can help with mild to moderate pain, in case of more severe pain o**pioid pain medications** such as Tramadol and Codeine should be able to keep the pain in check.Warm sitz baths can provide some relief.**How do I apply GNT or Nifedipine ointment?*** take a syringe - better if you can get a syringe with a catheter tip - or just get a 5 ml Luer slip syringe;* remove the needle and the plunger rod;* put 1 cc of ointment inside the syringe, if your ointment comes in a tube then 1 cc is roughly equivalent to 1 cm in length, if it comes in a small jar... well, then you'll get the knack...;* help yourself with the handle of a coffee spoon or a small spatula in order to get the ointment close to the tip of the syringe, or you can just use the plunger rod to push the ointment down;* lubricate the tip of the syringe using a very small amount of the ointment and put the plunger rod back in place;* lay down on your left side in the fetal position, keeping your legs closed;* insert the tip of the syringe and press the plunger rod quite quickly to apply the ointment, because it needs to go internally;* remove the syringe and close your cheeks with your hands and stay in that position for like a minute, to prevent the ointment from leaking out;* wash and disinfect the syringe should you wish to use it again for the same purpose;**What is a skin tag?**Chronic fissures may be more difficult to treat and may also have an external lump associated with the tear, called a sentinel pile or skin tag, as well as extra tissue just inside the anal canal, referred to as a hypertrophied papilla.The skin tag can be left in place, but it can be surgically removed should it be source of pain and discomfort, some people, though, have it removed for cosmetic reasons, even if the skin tag itself is not causing them any pain or discomfort.**I'm having a visit with a colorectal surgeon, what should I expect?**The surgeon will have you assume either the knee-chest or lateral position and will proceed to visually inspect the area by separating your cheeks with his/her hands.Next the surgeon will probably perform a digital exploration, by inserting his/her properly lubricated index finger in your anus, this allows the surgeon to feel your muscles and hemorrhoids.If your condition allows, the surgeon may perform an anoscopy, an examination using a small, rigid, tubular instrument called an anoscope (also called an anal speculum). This is inserted a few inches into the anus in order to evaluate problems of the anal canal.Before any maneuver the surgeon will lubricate his/her fingers or instruments with a Lidocaine-based lubricant to numb the area, sometimes you can be given a local anesthetic injection to further numb the area.**What can be the complications of an untreated anal fissure?**Besides hypertonia and the fissure itself turning chronic, and untreated anal fissure can lead to the formation an an anal abscess which, in turn, can many times lead to an anal fistula. Both anal abscesses and fistulas are usually treated surgically, even if an abscess can be treated with antibiotics.Another complication of an untreated anal fissure can be anal stenosis, also called anal stricture. If the muscle hypertonia is left untreated for too long, therefore having the muscle constantly contracted and rigid, this can lead to a permanent narrowing of the anal canal, that is treated surgically with a procedure called anoplasty.**I'm having LIS, what should I expect?**During the procedure you will most likely be asleep with deep sedation, a potent local anesthetic will also be administered during the procedure as well as antibiotics.You can expect the whole procedure to last around 45 minutes, between sedation and waking up in recovery.You will be discharged on the same day, ideally after a few hours and, if you're a male, after you're able to urinate on your own.Most surgical cuts are left open to heal on their own, however, should the cut be too hemorragic, it may be stitched or a gauze can be placed inside, you will surely have an external bandage.During the following days you should stick to a very healthy diet to promote regular and soft BMs.You will be required to disinfect the are at least 3 times per day and after every BM, you will do this by using a sterile gauze soaked in disinfectant and gently patting the area.You should rest for 7 to 10 days, when at home it would be best to have someone help you, my advice is to assume the position you're feeling most comfortable in, but you should walk a little but more each day.You will be given pain medications to manage post surgical pain, which, anyway, should be less than the pre surgery pain, your first defecation after surgery is usually less painful than before.Some bleeding or discharge in the days immediately after surgery, as well as some kind of incontinence to liquids or flatus can be expected, but it is temporary.**I'm healed, what can I do to prevent a relapse?**If you had LIS then relapse is less than 8%, in some studies is around 1%.In any case you should change your eating habits and stick religiously to a healthy diet, keeping your stool soft and well hydrated is the best way to avoid having another fissures, which can always happen again, although if you had LIS it should be now much easier to heal.As usual, go see a doctor as soon as you feel that something is not right."
none,"**Background Information**I needed a secondary device to work in mobility, I mostly work with Office files, so my usage would generally be web browsing, with around 10 tabs open, Word/Pages and Apple Music.I've always used either Windows or Linux, so, why a Mac? I've always been fascinated by the Macintosh system, I own an iPhone and I'm extremely satisfied, I've considered the Microsoft Surface Laptop 13.5, the Dell XPS 13 and the HP Spectre X360, they were actually more expensive than the Air and, considering my workflow, I've decided to give in to my persistent desire of having a Mac, by getting the i5 version, with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage.**Build Quality**This thing is solid, that's the first thing you notice. The second thing you notice is how thin and light it is, you don't really get the idea until you're actually seeing and using one. The third thing you notice is how well balanced it is.**Display**The display is honestly gorgeous. Even if it is 13.3 inches it's so sharp that it doesn't tire your eyes. Font rendering is so high quality that working with documents is actually easier than on most of 15 inches laptops and even some external displays.**Keyboard & Trackpad**The keyboard is fine. It's not stellar, in my view it still is inferior to the ThinkPad T Series keyboards, the Microsoft Surface keyboards and the Dell keyboards, but this is by no means a bad keyboard. It's stable and precise, it's definitely better than the old butterfly keyboard, the keycaps are very stable, they're also quite large making typing easier. The shape of the laptop itself is actually helping a lot, and that was one of the main reasons why I chose it, the palm rest area is pretty large for a laptop this size, making typing, both with the laptop on a desk or on your lap, a very pleasant experience.The trackpad, on the other hand, that's really something. Now I understand why Apple's trackpads are almost unanimously considered the best in the business and the measuring stick for other trackpads. It's large, precise and comfortable to use.**Speakers**These little speakers are loud! They're so powerful that when cranked up to maximum volume you can actually feel the whole chassis vibrate. They have good clarity even at maximum volume, but only for movies and talk, when you're listening to music I've noticed that, at full volume, you can hear a little bit of distortion and loss of sound quality.**Thermals, Fan Noise & Performance**I've updated the OS, watched 1080p videos and movies on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, in both cases using Safari, and Apple TV+ and I still have to hear the fan.The computer gets warm, when used on my lap the bottom can get uncomfortably hot, but that's to be expected, this happens with every laptop since soft surfaces block the exhaust vents, but on flat, hard surfaces the computer stays cool.Even when it was running hot I haven't noticed any performance drop. For its intended use - browsing, documents, media consumption - the machine works great.**Battery Life**This is an area where I think Apple's claims are a little overblown, I'm letting the OS manage brightness and it's connected to Wi-Fi, you can comfortably get a day's worth of work from this battery, but I don't think that you can get the touted 11 hours, unless you lower your brightness, but I was able to get around 8 hours, and I've extensively browsed the web, worked with Pages, watched videos and streamed music almost constantly, and I've also updated the OS.In roughly 1 hour's worth of typing of Pages, with Safari running in the background, it has already used 8% of the battery, I feel this kind of work should be using less battery, also considering I'm only using Apple's own software.**MacOS**The OS is really nice, it's fluid, responsive, wake from sleep is instantaneous.

none,"**Background Information**I needed a secondary device to work in mobility, I mostly work with Office files, so my usage would generally be web browsing, with around 10 tabs open, Word/Pages and Apple Music.I've always used either Windows or Linux, so, why a Mac? I've always been fascinated by the Macintosh system, I own an iPhone and I'm extremely satisfied, I've considered the Microsoft Surface Laptop 13.5, the Dell XPS 13 and the HP Spectre X360, they were actually more expensive than the Air and, considering my workflow, I've decided to give in to my persistent desire of having a Mac, by getting the i5 version, with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage.**Build Quality**This thing is solid, that's the first thing you notice. The second thing you notice is how thin and light it is, you don't really get the idea until you're actually seeing and using one. The third thing you notice is how well balanced it is.**Display**The display is honestly gorgeous. Even if it is 13.3 inches it's so sharp that it doesn't tire your eyes. Font rendering is so high quality that working with documents is actually easier than on most of 15 inches laptops and even some external displays.**Keyboard & Trackpad**The keyboard is fine. It's not stellar, in my view it still is inferior to the ThinkPad T Series keyboards, the Microsoft Surface keyboards and the Dell keyboards, but this is by no means a bad keyboard. It's stable and precise, it's definitely better than the old butterfly keyboard, the keycaps are very stable, they're also quite large making typing easier. The shape of the laptop itself is actually helping a lot, and that was one of the main reasons why I chose it, the palm rest area is pretty large for a laptop this size, making typing, both with the laptop on a desk or on your lap, a very pleasant experience.The trackpad, on the other hand, that's really something. Now I understand why Apple's trackpads are almost unanimously considered the best in the business and the measuring stick for other trackpads. It's large, precise and comfortable to use.**Speakers**These little speakers are loud! They're so powerful that when cranked up to maximum volume you can actually feel the whole chassis vibrate. They have good clarity even at maximum volume, but only for movies and talk, when you're listening to music I've noticed that, at full volume, you can hear a little bit of distortion and loss of sound quality.**Thermals, Fan Noise & Performance**I've updated the OS, watched 1080p videos and movies on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, in both cases using Safari, and Apple TV+ and I still have to hear the fan.The computer gets warm, when used on my lap the bottom can get uncomfortably hot, but that's to be expected, this happens with every laptop since soft surfaces block the exhaust vents, but on flat, hard surfaces the computer stays cool.Even when it was running hot I haven't noticed any performance drop. For its intended use - browsing, documents, media consumption - the machine works great.**Battery Life**This is an area where I think Apple's claims are a little overblown, I'm letting the OS manage brightness and it's connected to Wi-Fi, you can comfortably get a day's worth of work from this battery, but I don't think that you can get the touted 11 hours, unless you lower your brightness, but I was able to get around 8 hours, and I've extensively browsed the web, worked with Pages, watched videos and streamed music almost constantly, and I've also updated the OS.In roughly 1 hour's worth of typing in Pages, with Safari running in the background, it has already used 8% of the battery, I feel this kind of work should be using less battery, also considering I'm only using Apple's own software.**MacOS**The OS is really nice, it's fluid, responsive, wake from sleep is instantaneous.

none,"Good day to you all, I've decided to make this post in the hope of possibly alleviating some of your fears and to share what worked for me while I had the anal fissure and regarding the lateral internal sphincterotomy surgery.Comment or PM me should you have further questions.**Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor or a health professional, I'm just a guy who had this problem and is sharing his experience and what worked for me. Don't take any  medical advice from me, or any other random dude on the Internet for that matter, go see a real doctor!**Since this is going to be a long post here's the TL;DR:* see a colorectal surgeon asap!;* really, see a doctor!;* LIS is nowhere as bad as having the fissure;* if it has not healed within 4 to 6 weeks consider surgery;* if given the opportunity to have LIS, do it;* **be sure to choose an experienced surgeon who's specialized in colorectal surgery**, check his resume, look for reviews; yes, the surgery itself is minor but consider that the internal sphincter is just 5 mm wide, if they cut too little you'll still have the fissure, if they cut too much you'll be incontinent for life, you must be willing to take that risk (and after 15 months, boy I was ready!);* don't read too may studies, like I did, regarding the surgery, every study has a different conclusion, the surgery is minor;* I assure you, having the fissure is way, way worse than having LIS;* most of the remedies and medications are short-term palliatives;* change your diet, what you eat matters, a lot;What **worked for me** while I had the fissure:* 3 liters of non-carbonated water every day;* Whole grain pasta, bread and cakes;* Milk, 1 or two glasses every day;* Whole grain rice and cereals made things worse;* Vegetables, fried or stewed: zucchini, bell peppers, eggplant, peas, potatoes;* Meat and fish no problems;* Fruits: apples, bananas, pears, grapes, watermelon;* Greek yogurt;* Pear juice;* Occasional pizza and ice cream;* No cheese, alcohol, soft drinks, spicy food, fast foods, chocolate, black tea;* Fiber supplements (Psyllium husk), around 9 g per day, stool softeners (Lactulose) 15 ml per day, mild laxative (Macrogol and Potassium salts) 17.5 g per day;* Pain management: Tramadol 50 mg pill in case of severe pain, less severe pain successfully treated with 1000 mg of Paracetamol and local anesthetic (Lidocaine ointment);* Sitz baths never helped much;* Use soap with aloe vera for cleaning after BM (the one I still use is Sapigen-K);Here's a summary of **surgery day**:* Arrived at the hospital at 7:30 A.M., did pre-surgery exams (blood and heart rate);* Went to the operating room around 10:30 and had interview with anesthesiologist;* Surgery was performed under deep sedation and local anesthesia, so I was asleep, they gave me oxygen while they started giving me drugs for deep sedation and fell asleep instantly;* During surgery I was given 2000 mg of antibiotics;* Surgery was over in, I guess, 20 minutes. I woke up in recovery and was back in my room at 11:15. I had no pain at all and no recollection of the surgery.* I was discharged at 3 PM. Was told to medicate surgery area with disinfectant for a week, after every BM. I had to use a gauze soaked with disinfectant and gently pat the area. Disinfectant was Amukine Med.* Was given Tachidol (Paracetamol + Codeine) in case of pain and number to call in case of any problems;* No pain during the day;* Had light dinner: stewed chicken legs and stewed zucchini;* No problems sleeping;* No pain medication needed; In case you're facing **surgery**, this is my **post-surgery experience**:* Took 1 Tachipirina 1000 (1000 mg Paracetamol, a mild pain killer) tablet on Friday and 1 on Sunday - surgery was on a Thursday -;* **Never had pain**. Only minor discomfort, level 1 or 2 at most.* **Never had incontinence**. Saw 3 small drops of pink discharge on underwear on the second or third day post surgery.* On the 6th day had troubles with BMs and used enema, was told to do this by surgeon;* Stopped using laxatives and only took stool softeners (Lactulose) and fiber supplements (Psyllium);* Diet: soft foods (stewed vegetables, stewed chicken legs and fish – cod, flounder, mackerel – milk, stewed apples and pears, Greek yogurt, water) No bread or anything hard for a week.* One week post-surgery had check up visit: healing was fine had a small external hemorrhoid;* Discomfort was gone after 10 days;* BMs became feeling normal after 4 weeks;* Second checkup visit November 11, 2019: found a small hemorrhoid in anal canal, given therapy, 2 Flavonoids pills, twice a day for 14 days;* Check-up visit on December 2nd: hemorrhoid gone;**Post-surgery care**:* 10 days to 2 weeks rest;* Only minor discomfort never had pain;* Follow doctor's instructions;* Keep the area clean;* Keep BMs as soft and regular as possible;* Be wary of hemorrhoids, surgery puts straining on the area;* **Biggest obstacle is fear**, an anal fissure's psychological toll is fear, BMs will start feel natural again in about 4 weeks.  So, **how's my life now**? (5 months after surgery)* Life is great! I've never had any pain, only some minor discomfort here and there, especially after a large BM, but some discomfort is to be expected in the months after a surgery, but really, it is just the occasional minor discomfort;* Never had bleeding or incontinence in any form;* I'm still conscious with my diet, I was actually advised by the surgeon to still follow a diet, to still eat healthily (water, fruits, vegetables and whole grains) but I can eat and drink whatever I want, of course, if I don't eat properly I will have a harder BM, some minor discomfort, but that's it;* Had I known the surgery would be so minor I would have had it immediately;Here's my story.I had my first episode on July 14, 2018 and had my surgery on October 3rd, 2019.My first fissure, in July, was definitely caused by repeated hard BMs, I was following a very unhealthy diet, with poor fiber intake, lots of lemon-scented coke, a couple of beers every day and generous servings of chocolate chip ice cream.I was having hard stools for at least a week when one day I saw a lot of bright, red blood on the toilet paper, after I had seen just a few drops in the days before. Starting from that day I had problems comfortably sitting down, at first I thought it was normal since my BMs were hard and I actually thought I just broke a small vein because of the effort and that was what caused the bleeding.The pain and the burning, however, wasn't stopping or subsiding, on the contrary it was increasing every single day.So I tried to change my diet, I stopped drinking coke and beer in favor of water, a lot of water, close to 3 liters (100 oz or 0.8 gallons) every day, whole grain pasta, bread and cakes, probiotics pills and fiber supplements - Psyllium-based, the supplement's name in Italy is Psyllogel, I believe it to be comparable to US' Metamucil -.By changing my diet I was able to heal the fissure on my own  at the turn of August and September 2018.On a pain scale from 0 to 10 I would say the pain from the first fissure was between 4 and 5, it was present enough to impact my daily life but not so bad that I had to change my daily routine.At the beginning of October I had my first relapse, I was being a little bit more lax with my diet but still pretty conscious.This time the symptoms were different, the pain was immediately more violent, I would say a solid 6 and I started having troubles driving, many many times, in the following months too, I was forced to drive trying to lift me up with my right hand on the passenger's eat and by lifting my butt up using my left leg, I should also say I drive a manual transmission car, so you can imagine how uncomfortable that was.Since it was the second time it happened in a short time I went to see my GP, he correctly diagnosed it as a fissure and we tried to ointments, first one called Nomor, which should have sped up the healing process, but after 5 days of using it I was having more pain than before so he changed my therapy to another ointment, called Levorag, which should have created a film-like protection for the fissure to allow it to heal naturally; Levorag actually helped a little bit, he also gave me a stool softener, a Lactulose-based syrup called Peristil, I was to take 15 ml every day, it worked wonders but I still was very much in pain, even though my GP prescribed Nimesulide as a pain killer, but it wasn't working.Towards early December 2018 the pain became way more intense, I would say a 7/10 pain, I had to take 10 days of sick leave and went to see a colorectal surgeon.The surgeon diagnosed the anal fissure with internal sphincter hypertonia. He told me the medications I was taking were useless, because the problems I was having healing the fissure were caused by the muscle hypertonia and those medications did not address this problem. He gave me a 0.2% GTN ointment, twice a day for 4 weeks, and a local anesthetic - Lidocaine ointment - to help with the pain.Following his therapy I was pain free in 3 or 4 days, and stayed that way until the second week of January 2019 when the pain came back suddenly, we're talking 7/10 and sometimes 8/10 here.I immediately went back to see the surgeon and he concluded I wasn't applying the GTN ointment correctly, he showed me the proper technique and told me to use it for another 4 weeks. It relieved some pain, back to 4/10 and 5/10, but some days was worse, like 6/10 and 7/10.Things stayed stable with mild pain until March 2019 when I started having lots of pain and troubles with BMs.In late March 2019 I went to see the surgeon and he performed Lord's Operation - anal stretch with his fingers - he deemed the procedure to be urgent and performed it in ambulatory setting with only local anesthesia. It was painful, very, very painful. After the operation he gave me a different local anesthetic, called EMLA - which is a mixture of Lidocaine and Prilocaine, so it should be stronger than Lidocaine alone - kept me on a high fiber diet, lots of water, stool softeners, fiber supplements and he added a mild laxative, the prescription's name is Colirei, which is Macrogol and Potassium salts, 2 half bags every day.It took me 10 days for the pain to go away and I was pain free for a while. When I went to see the surgeon I was feeling great but I had some very minor discomfort after a BM, he visited me and said the fissure was healed but I still had some muscle hypertonia, he told me to keep using the GTN ointment and also to use dilators, 5 minutes, twice a day, for 4 weeks. The dilators - commercial name is Dilatan - come in 5 sizes (18, 20, 23, 27, 30 mm) , I had to reach the 30 mm size and use it for 4 weeks, the smaller ones are there only to let you work your way up to the 30 mm.Dilators caused discomfort, I tried to use them, (18 and 20 mm) until early May, stopped and tried again in June, worked my way up to 30 mm in July, stopped in late July because of pain, stayed in pain the whole month of August 2019. On August 26, 2019 I went to see the surgeon, he said he tried everything he could but there was nothing left and if I wanted to solve this problem I had to have surgery, we scheduled the surgery on October 11th, 2019.He told me to stop using the GTN ointment and the dilators, I just had to keep my BMs as regular and soft as possible.I actually had no problems until late September 2019, I was almost pain free and my BMs were fine.On September 27th however I started having intense pain, level 8 to 9, controlled only by 1 or 2 pills of 50 mg of Tramadol (opioid pain medication), pain lasted all day and BMs became impossible, because of pain and hypertonia, down there I was so tight because of the hypertonia that it became almost impossible to have a BM.I kept a fluid only diet for a week, only milk and water, I was so desperate and in pain that I told myself  ""Well, if I don't eat anything solid maybe I won't have to use the toilet, or it will just be liquid"", I was wrong.On October 2nd, 2019 I had a collapse because of lack of nutrients, my parents called surgeon and rushed me to the hospital. He visited me under local anesthesia and I still can remember his words: ""We'll do the surgery tomorrow because in a week you won't be there"", I'm 181 cm tall (5 ft 9 in) and on that day I weighed 65 kg (143 lbs).And after that day, October 3rd, 2019, I began to enjoy life once again."

none,"TLDR:  AF for past 6-7 months with 10/10 pain, had botox and LIS(3.5 weeks ago) pain does not exceed 4/10 now. Developed haemorrhoids post LIS and became lactose intolerant 2 months ago. Noticed lots of irregularities in bowel movements, alternating  bouts of constipation/hard stool and diarrhoea for last 3 months Need reassurance and hope that this pain is normal and it will get betterLong post ahead but please read.I had LIS 3.5 weeks ago after 6-7 months of very painful fissures. The pain from my fissures used to go UpTo a 9/10 or 10/10 everyday and after a few months I finally had botox. The pain after that went down by about 50% and did not exceed a 5/10.1.5 months after my botox, I had LIS on my doctor's recommendation as my fissure wasn't healing. After LIS pain again went down by 50% I would say but I'm still a bit nervous. I have made a few observations about my pain and need some reassurance that it will get better from here. The first week after LIS was actually really good. Pain wouldn't exceed 2  or 3/10 and I was able to sit a lot more than I could before. I was having bowel movements between 2 and 4 times a day without taking any laxatives or fiber supplements but I didn't mind too much as there was very little pain both during and after bowel movements. Week 2 I noticed the pain went up a bit and I could feel 2 lumps down below. I visited my GP and he confirmed that they were haemorrhoids and prescribed Scheriproct ointment. I have been applying that for almost 2 weeks now and my haemorrhoids seem to have shrunk quite a bit and the only thing I feel down below are skin tags (I think). Week 3 I noticed that the haemorrhoids have shrunk quite  a bit but pain levels are still more or less the same. On days that I take painkillers I have very minimal pain (less than 2/10) and on days that I don't, it goes up to 4/10One other thing that I have noticed is that sometimes bowel movements are pretty painful (5/10) but there is no pain after and I am able to sit as well. The pain generally starts 2-3 hours after bowel movements and lasts for a couple of hours. My bowel movements seem to have gone down from 1-4 times a day to 1-2 times a day now but my stool consistency still feels very weird to me. I have had on and off bouts of constipation/hard stool and diarrhoea for the last 3 months now. My bowel movements seem to either by small, lumpy and hard to pass or just loose and watery. My diet generally consists of 25-35g of fibre a day and I have been drinking 2.5 - 3.5 litres of water a day. I also noticed roughly 2 months ago that drinking milk would give me diarrhoea, stomach cramps and gas leading me to believe I have suddenly become lactose intolerant. I spoke to my GP about all of this and he will be getting me an appointment with a gastroenterologist but I will have to wait a few weeks for that. I want to hear your thoughts and hope that these pain levels are normal and that they will go down soon."

I had 3 major issues: 1. the sound on my left earbud would stop for a split second every few minutes.. it wasn't too big of a deal but it was very annoying.2. The earbud controls were messed up for me. The switch between talkthrough was very buggy for me. Often times my play/pause button would toggle the talkthrough and I had no way to control play/pause3. The ANC just would not work. I got a firmware update yesterday and I thought I would give it a try before thinking of returning my pair. I am glad that I did that because the firmware update fixed all the problems that I had. I don't have connection issues with my left earbud anymore, my earbud controls work exactly as expected and my ANC works as well.

none,"Just posting here because this might help anyone else stuck in the same situation. I got a new monitor and a display link docking station around a month ago using which I connected my laptop to my monitor. Ever since then I was getting massive FPS drops (from 100 to 40-50) even in games with low requirements (paladins and rocket league) and even at the lowest settings. After suffering with that for 3 weeks I finally found the solution. Turns out that because my monitor was connected to my docking station, it was using my laptop's integrated graphics card instead of the dedicated NVIDIA one. I disconnected that and plugged in the cable from the monitor directly to my graphics card and now I'm back to my high fps.Can't believe it took me that long to figure it out"

If the map is one where you can easily throw people off the map, take Khan and maximise your morale boost. Once you have your ultimate, grab someone with it and jump of the map and then throw them off after you jump. If the map doesn't have any places to throw people off, take skye and maximise your morale boost. Once you have your ultimate,  go between 2-3 enemies and once you are very low  use your ultimate and let them kill you . If your bomb goes off after you die the kills will count towards your challenge. Using this method I was able to get a maximum of 4 kills a game"

none,"Thanos just jumping with an army to a different timeline should have definitely created a nexus event. Loki show never went over this. After introducing something like TVA and it's role in the timeline, how can they never explain the timelines created in  endgame?edit: everyone says TVA already did their job. and any branches created have been pruned. however, if that's the case then why is the main mcu timeline post endgame still existing? Thanos jumping from 2014 would create a nexus event in that timeline definitely as there would be no infinity war without Thanos in that timeline. now let's say that got pruned by the TVA, that'd mean Thanos and his army are all variants. if they r Variants and end up starting a war in 2023 of a different timeline, that'd create another nexus event and I am sure that one hasn't been pruned as tony is still dead"
none,"either the show didn't rly explain it or I just didn't understand.why did HWR say that if he gets killed, an infinite versions of him will take place?? like I understand the logic that when the multiverse starts, an infinite amount of him will exist leading to another multiverse war. but what I don't understand is why would his death lead to a multiverse? they say he was managing the flow of time but what was he doing rly? once he isolated the sacred timeline, he created the TVA which was managing everything. everytime a nexus event occurs, TVA detects variance energy, goes there and prunes the timeline. this is how they were maintaining the sacred timeline. HWR wasn't rly doing anything. his role was pretty much done after he created the TVA. why does the end imply that him being alive is what was keep the timeline from being branched? why did him dying immediately lead to so many Nexus events?"
none,"HWR already knew what both the Lokis were gonna do and say. he later claims he is the one who made this path for them and that's why he knows everything that's gonna happen(up until the threshold). but I don't understand how could he do this to variants? I can understand him being able to ""write"" a story which the sacred timeline follows but he shouldn't be able to do this to variants. variants should technically have free will because if they don't and they r just following a story already written by HWR, then wtf is the point of TVA? if he is the reason behind all the variants acting the way they do (which makes them walk a different path from the one they r supposed to in the sacred timeline), then why is the TVA  required? why create such variants in the first place? avoiding it would avoid Nexus events which means avoiding any branch in timeline. he wouldn't need the TVA if he doesn't include the variants in his narrative of the sacred timeline"
none,"TVA is outside the sacred timeline. for the TVA, all the events inside the sacred timeline should happen simultaneously, not one after the other because they can see the entire timeline from a higher dimensional perspective. but I don't understand why do they have to deal with the variants one after the other. for example, they dealt with various loki variants before, then Sylvie, then Hiddleston loki. why is this all happening linearly for them? shouldn't mobius and other TVA agents see this all happening at once because they can see the entire timeline...all instants of time at once. TVA's job should be a one time thing. the moment TVA was created, they'd see the entire timeline and all the Nexus events happening simultaneously. why is it that they deal with a nexus event and then chill at their headquarters for some time until another nexus event happens, shouldn't the events happen all at once for them as they can see the entire timeline and would know what happens when?"

none,"lemme just say that I absolutely loved the first 2 eps of the show. I think the first 2 eps already made loki better than FatWS and i was expecting that it'd be above Wandavision by ep 3 or 4. But now that ep 4 is here, I have kinda lost the hype for the show. I think the reason for me not finding ep 3 and 4 that entertaining is Sylvie. I think her character is boring and I would have preferred to get more scenes with the TVA. the show's strong parts are the world building and mystery surrounding the TVA imo. mobius is the most enjoyable character in the show and every scene with him is a banger. Now I am not trying to shit on the show, I am just curious to know if there is anyone else who is with me here cuz posts everywhere give me the idea that I am alone who thinks this wayPs. I didn't think ep 4 was boring. In fact, it was kinda fun(as opposed to ep 3) but it didn't get me hyped for ep 5.I was much more hyped for ep 2 after watching ep 1 and ep 3 after watching ep 2"
none,srsly where does it go? what happens to it? what's its final destination?
none,"if you have not seen odd taxi yet, then please drop whatever you are watching right now and go watch odd taxi. it's a mystery show of 13 episodes that was released this season. it's final ep finally aired yesterday and all Imma say is that...it's a true masterpiece. please don't get fooled by its art style, it may look kinda cartoonish but try ignoring that cuz the story telling is very unique and amazing.      just to give an idea of what it's about...the plot revolves around a case of a missing girl in a small town and there are about 12-15 characters with independent plot lines that overlap with each other in some way to form a larger singular story. The main character is a taxi driver who ends up getting involved with these other characters. The character writing is one of strongest parts of the show. Every character is interesting and very different. I promise u'll enjoy watching every character's story in the show. the music is solid and the opening is a banger. The show keeps you on your toes the entire time like literally some mysteries are revealed in the last minute of the show. Also, ik usually anime endings are disappointing but don't worry, odd taxi's ending is pretty much perfect. This is one of the most tightly written shows I have ever seen. It's hard to explain what I mean by that exactly, but what I am trying to say is that the way all the characters' stories intertwine with each other is just perfect. There's a lot of foreshadowing done of future reveals in every episode .so as you watch the show, a lot of what was previously shown/said starts making more sense. I can go on and on abt how entertaining this show is but instead I'll just say that the show is perfect in every way and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it. Btw, another good thing abt the show is that its pacing is great, so it's rly fun from the start. So, u don't have to wait till a certain episode for it to get good, if u don't like the first 2 eps, u won't like the show and can immediately drop it. Having said that, I think it's very unlikely that u won't like it. So now go and watch it bois"
none,"hey guys, so I am kinda a noob at this and I'd like ur advice. so I am not rly planning to a build a pc atm but I have a question related to processors and idk which subreddit to ask abt this. sry if this question is not for this sub. so I was reading abt intel processors nd shiz, it got me thinking about the generations of different types of intel processors. what I'd like to ask is that does a higher generation of an inferior processor perform better than lower generation of a superior processor? like does i3 7th gen performs better than i5 2nd gen or is that i5 1st gen is better than every gen of i3 processor and so on? how does this thing work? and if it's the former, how do we actually compare the different types of generations of different kinds of processors to each other?I am sorry if it's a stupid question, I am a complete rookie at this but am willing to learn abt it. could someone help me understand this? thanks in advance guys"

none,"So in episode 2, mobius shows several versions of Loki variants they've caught. They were all different kinds of Lokis. One was blue, one was buffed, etc. What I don't understand is that where are these different types of Lokis(including sylvie aka lady loki) coming from. As I understand it, there's only 1 timeline, the sacred timeline that we've been told abt...which means if there were more loki variants, they should all be from the sacred timeline. they should be different versions of the same kind of Loki. They should all be types of 'our' Loki that we've been following in the mcu. where are these different types of Lokis coming from if there's no other timeline in existence apart from the sacred timeline?"
none,"I am 21 rn and up until Feb 2020, I had to never face this problem in my life. The first anal fissure I experienced was in March of last year. It was extremely painful so I referred to a doctor who gave me a stool softener, a diet plan, a tube to apply on the local region and recommended sitz bath. I followed all of it and guess what...I was back to normal in a month. Could again defecate without any pain or blood. but this problem returned a few months later. I followed the same procedure and it worked again. Then it happened again after a few months and I was able to stop it from getting worse even quicker than before. But what's happening now is that it has started happening more frequently. After every couple of weeks, I have to go through this. Why? why am I facing this problem? why did it suddenly start happening from last yr when I had never faced this issue all my life? how can I stop this permanently? I AM SICK OF ANAL FISSURE. sometimes the pain is unbearable and I don't want to depend on stool softeners and sitz bath for the rest of my life. should I include something in my diet that can permanently solve this problem? Pl give me some advice. thanks in advance edit: does this have anything to do with excercising? I have not been working out at all ever since the pandemic started and mostly spend my time on my pc or study desk. I am getting the feeling it has something to do with this as sitting on one spot without getting any excercise is never good for the body. so can someone pl confirm this, does it affect in any way?"
none,"I see people everywhere on the internet ranting about how awful laugh tracks in sitcoms are and ya know what...I can honestly understand why people find laugh tracks annoying but I personally don't think they are an issue. I don't particularly like them, but I don't find them irritating either. they're just there. I feel like people complaint a bit too much tho. Laugh tracks kinda become part of the show, I don't think people should be having any trouble adjusting to it. I think people find it annoying when any show puts laugh tracks on random dialogues which aren't funny, but I don't understand what's the issue with that. U don't have to laugh at every joke, why should it bother you if other people are laughing at something that u don't think is funny?? Yes ik, people aren't rly laughing and it's a recorded audio but it still shouldn't matter. it's not like laugh tracks are played in the middle of dialogues. The show runners always make sure all the dialogues are completely audible, so the tracks are played at specific times.Tbh , I don't even notice laugh tracks now. it becomes like a wall in the background. I can understand if people prefer watching comedy shows without laugh tracks but I do think that people complaint wayyy too much abt it"
none,hey everyone!!so I have had atla in my watchlist for a long time. I finally started watching it with high expectations. I am almost done with season 1 and I am not enjoying the show so far. One of my frnds said it gets much better in S2 but I am kinda getting the feeling from s1 that this show isn't for me. so what I'd like to ask is...should I continue watching the show or am I just wasting my time??  does it rly pick up from S2?

none,so I am watching the currently ongoing anime- Odd Taxi and I absolutely love it. is there any show similar to this where several independent stories of different characters(living in 1 city) start connecting with each other and forms a greater story filled with mystery? I wanna watch something similar to this. any recommendations?
none,Idk if this type of anime even exists but I was wondering if there is something similar to lord of the rings in animes....or even something like Got. A bit more on the serious side with a big world and lots of characters. I have already seen one piece and I absolutely loved its world building but this time I am looking for something more serious with equally vast world. got any recommendations fellas?
none,"ik the movies are considered non canon in general but if that's true, how were shiratori and momoji introduced in the movies before they were introduced in the anime? the events of movie 21 are even stated in ep 928. On top of that, movie 16 states an event that happened in one of the magic files(ep 4 I think) which was also talked abt in the anime. I am pretty sure there were more events that connect movies directly to the anime but the movies can't be cannon because then there would be other contradiction in the anime like kaito knowing true identity of conan. so like...wtf is up with canonicity of the movies?"
none,"surprisingly, there aren't many good Vermouth wallpapers online lol. I am having a hard time finding any for desktop. if anyone's got any good ones, share em pl...would rly appreciate it. thanks in advance"

none,I need an anime of 24 eps or less that keeps me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Something like promised Neverland season 1. The pacing should be good. I don't want to waste time on long ass build up. The show doesn't have to be a masterpiece or anything. just something that keeps me interested the whole time and is binge worthy.edit: forgot to add...I am looking something in mystery genre
none,I saw the original JL when it was first released and just saw the Snyder cut recently. I don't understand all this hype around the new JL. The first 3 hours looked exactly like the previous JL...just more stretched with a few more plot points added. The last hour was definitely different but I don't see how people enjoyed this one so much more. I could be forgetting wheadon cut since it has been 3 yrs but I honestly don't think the Snyder cut was much different.
none,"*Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but here goes...*99% of the people on the entire planet don't like their jobs. I am a student right now and I can see where my life is going...Imma end up doing a regular 9-6 job for a stable life that most people(who hate their jobs) are doing. But I don't want to go in this direction. I don't understand how we live in a world where most of our lives are spent working, doing something we don't like. Now, I am not saying I want to escape work, what I want to do...is find a profession that I actually like. I am ready to work hard on something that I truly enjoy doing. I want to look forward to Mondays. I don't want to live a life where I work the entire week on something I don't like and get depressed every Sunday evening cuz I have to repeat the same shit all over again from the next day. Work literally takes up majority of the time we have in our lives...which means we spend most of our lives not living it the way we want.So what I am actually trying to ask is that - is it possible to actually find a profession that you like?? a job that doesn't make you feel like a slave but makes you happy?? if yes, How?"
none,"idk what y'all keep on complaining about. hobbit movies are pretty good. I don't see why everyone criticises them. sure they aren't lotr trilogy level but so what? a movie doesn't have to be a masterpiece to be entertaining. all I hear is everyone saying how awful the hobbit trilogy is. what I don't understand is...what's so awful abt them? the adventure is pretty good. acting is solid. the characters are really fun to watch(especially thorin, I thought he was a great character with solid development). every scene in dol guldur is simply brilliant. The pacing isn't the best, it does get boring at times but I think there are amazing scenes to compensate for that, like Gollum scene or Smaug-biblo interaction scene. I was rly happy to see Gandalf actually use his powers in hobbit... which rarely happens lol. Legolas had dope action scenes. I honestly don't understand why people thought the trilogy was so bad.also...Bilbo>>>frodoP.s. Smaug's end was shit though...I'll admit that."

none,"idc what everyone thinks, Bale's batman voice is dope. I think it's badass...basically because it's intimidating and sounds cool. and this is not in comparison to any other batman or anything. Ben's robotic voice was pretty cool too, just in a different way. honestly speaking, I never had a problem with Bale's voice and always found it pretty cool. I didn't even know that most people hated it until I joined some Facebook groups. I will admit that I actually understand why people don't like it. it does get a bit cringey at times...especially when he is expressing some sort of heavy emotion like ""where were the other drugs going"" in anger. On scenes like this, bale did go a bit overboard but for the most part I think it was pretty cool and I am happy with Nolan & Bale's decision to use this voice in the movie."

I think cat girl designs are weird af. it shouldn't have been a thing in the first place. now...I am not one of those people who are against the concept of being attracted to a 2d character. I understand that, I understand being attracted to game characters or anime characters. they are designed to look beautiful with the perfect features that humans desire(altho exaggerated). but I just don't get the appeal of cat girls in specific. why tf would u be attracted to a human fused with an animal? people out there legit think that cat ears(and fur at times) on human girls is hot....like...wtf. what's the appeal of that? how is a human with features of an animal considered hot?I have criticised them before in my comments in several anime subreddits and I have gotten heavily downvoted every signal time. I am not saying that they are just overrated, I am outright saying that I find cat girls ugly and weird as hell. tbh I have seen some characters that could have had rly nice designs if they weren't ruined by the animal features added to them."
none,"at the end of trunks Saga, they all decide to train for 3 yrs to get stronger so they can take on the Androids in the future. but bulma suggests to ask shenron for gero's location and kill him before he has a chance to make the androids. why the fuck didn't they follow this plan? Goku says that gero hasn't done anything bad yet so it wouldn't be fair to kill him before he makes the androids...whatt???? he was in the red ribbon army, a fuckin criminal, he deserved to die anyway. + why risk it? I mean why risk the fate of their world for such a lousy reason?now I can still understand why Vegeta and Goku didn't follow this plan...they're saiyans, fighting is in their blood. they would die before use such a cheap trick to kill their enemies. they always want to win fair and square. so it's still somewhat understandable why Goku and Vegeta were against this plan. but why didn't the rest of the z warriors protest against Goku and Vegeta... especially someone as sensible as picolo. they should have agreed with bulma and went with her plan. why didn't they?"
none,"Almost every single person(including non-mcu fans) prefer IW over endgame. I personally found endgame more entertaining.I admit that the first 2 hours of endgame aren't nearly as fun as IW but the last hour of endgame makes IW look like thanos taking out the avengers for an ice cream treat. I fuckin love the fact that endgame was such fan service film. this is what I wanted from a superhero movie which sums up a franchise of 20+ films. I love that I got to see all the heroes together on one screen. loved how they ended cap and Tony's story arcs. IW might be better paced but it just doesn't have individual scenes that are as epic as some of endgame's scenes...like avengers assemble or cap lifting mjolnir or the ""I am iron man"" scene. Having said all that, I can actually understand why most think IW is superior and honestly speaking, maybe it is objectively better written but I just don't think it's as fun as endgame which basically has all the scenes that I have wanted to watch for years....endgame's purpose was not to be unpredictable but to be the way fans wanted. it includes the stuff that the fans had always dreamt of when imagining a final battle movie that concludes the infinity saga. also endgame is funnier and longer. tldr: endgame is a total fan service movie and I love it."

none,"don't get me wrong, I am not criticizing character designs of dc in general. most are pretty average/satisfactory and some designs are rly cool. but for some reason, every character has a long ass nose, which bugs me a bit. for reference https://images.app.goo.gl/y97L7JDv6cwgFJpr7ik that aoyama likes to draw em a bit longer and pointed but I feel that the anime exaggerates it even more(nd adds a curve) and they end up looking weird af. in some shots, they looks so bad that they make the characters look awful. I got used to it watching dc for such a long time but it still bugs me a lil bit. am I the only one who thinks the characters would have looked much better with a normal nose like in other animes?"

I just can't seem to enjoy this anime and fail to understand whats so special abt it. in usual cases I permanently drop an anime if I can't get into it after trying it twice but since cowboy bebop is in everyone's ""best animes of all time"" list, I am considering giving it a third chance. I am getting the feeling that it's not for me as it's an episodic show so the rest of the eps r prolly like the first 4 but I'd rly appreciate your opinions on thiswhat do y'all think...should I continue? does it get better later on? if yes, then from which ep?"

Tbh, I had high expectations when I finally sat down to watch it. But it turned out to be disappointing af. I will admit that I have only watched the original trilogy which is considered the best star wars trilogy by most fans. If I didn't like the original trilogy, it's safe to say I won't like the prequels and sequels either. What I don't understand is that why do people love this franchise? Is it just nostalgia? Not saying that everything that happened in the OT was boring. I mean even I liked some scenes from empire strikes back but overall the movies were just....bad. the action is cringy. Most of the characters are boring and the way they establish the premise of the movies is really really really bad. Like text rolling on the screen to tell viewers what's going on lmao. And the overall story isn't really all that impressive, like people overrate it so much. Ik this is a very subjective thing but the story wasn't nearly as good as people make it out to be. It was okayish and predictable. I mean i can understand that it was probably a big deal in the decade it was released. But right now, it's just a boring flick. There are a lot of other reasons why I didn't like it and thought it was boring but rn I am more curious in learning why people actually like it. Come on, Gimme ur reasons..."
none,"Don't understand why no one is talking about this. There is a major plot hole regarding the box time machine that everyone was using. It's loop never completed.Claudia gives tanhaus the blueprintsTanhaus makes the time machineFuture jonas brings a rusty time machine to tanhausTanhaus uses that to complete his time machineFuture jonas leaves the rusty time machine with tanhaus and takes the new one with himHannah steals itHannah reaches adam with her time machineAdam kills her and keeps the time machineAdam gives the time machine to NoahNoah gives it to BartoszBartosz gives it to magnusMagnus to katharinaKathrina to future jonasFuture jonas uses it to escape the apocalypse saving his friends...they go to 1988They form sic mundus and have the time machineNow we know that the rusty time machine adult jonas brought to tanhaus was given to him by Claudia....who got it from her older self. The question is...how did the older self of Claudia had the time machine? She shouldn't have it because she gives it to jonas in 2052...who brings it to tanhaus and continues the loop I explained above. So old Claudia shouldn't have the machine, the only way she could get it was if she somehow stole it from sic mundus because they had it as you can see in the last step of the loop I wrote above"
none,"They never completed this, did they?Book was written by origin, passed onto Alt claudia, who gives it to ""our"" claudia. Claudia removes some pages and gives it to tronte. We see noah picking it up from Elizabeth's table in 2041, carries it with him the entire show. Later kills claudia and gets the missing pages. Takes it to adam in 1921. He gets killed by Agnes. Safe to assume adam keeps the book(along with the missing pages) from then on. But how does the book reach from tronte to Elisabeth's room???Oh and btw noah also gives it to Bartosz for a short while but it doesn't matter as he takes it back immediately."

none,"Hi everyone, for a long stretch of time to solve my fissure issues I started to drink prune juice every day. I felt like this caused too much bloating so I started taking a laxative. After having daily diarrhea my fissure did not hurt at all.I decided then I want to start having soft sausage like stool so I stopped the laxatives gradually and tried to fix my diet. I learned that too much fiber to soon was not good, it caused very hard stool, not smooth at all. I learned about insoluble and soluble fiber, and stopped eating wheat cereal.I then re started my laxative panic button to heal the fissure.Now my diet has a ton of fruits, 3-4 liters of water a day and half a glass of prune juice before bed. I exercise a lot too. For a while this was working so well, but this morning I had a painful stool. I checked the bowl and I'm SO CONFUSED. The stool looked PERFECT, it looked smooth, not too big and sausage like. It was hard to pass but not as hard as the high fiber stool that mess me up.I'm thinking, is my sphincter ruined? Is it only capable of dealing with diarrhea and extremely soft stool?I made such great progress, eating a strict diet, and when I finally achieved what looked like ""normal"" stool, I couldn't handle it! I don't know what to do now.Any tips would be very appreciated."

none,"Ok so, I'm really nervous about starting the Witcher 3. I really really don't like long games, very little games are good enough to last that long. I typically skip side quests unless I see it will add to the story. From what I've seen Gerald looks really boring and I hate his voice, he seems like your average RPG protagonist. I like funny characters like Nathan Drake.But right now I live in a time where people say things like ""I judge all modern games to Witcher 3"" it has such high praise! I'm really worried I won't like it. I don't know anything about the story, but I started it for half an hour and it didn't seem great. I also really don't like how you need to do your research on what oils you need to use to defeat certain enemies? That sounds like something I don't have time for, I heard you need to pause the game a lot and read a monster manual, did that not get tiresome? I saw a post yesterday on patientgamers saying Witcher 3 threads are shit posts since it's so highly received so here's my questions: do any of my concerns lead those of you who beat it to think I won't enjoy it?Do you have any tips on difficulty and how to start out?Do any of you know people who played for like 50 hours and didn't enjoy it?Thank you, I want to play it since I've owned the game since September'16. I much prefer 10 hour experiences. I should mention story means a lot to me too and I hate grinding. I beat Skyrim and I wasn't so impressed. Felt like a waste of time in the end. The graphics weren't even that great."

I'll be earning much more than I am in the future so I figure I'll most likely be ditching whatever phone I have then anyway since by then we'll be on like the S9 or something.TL;DR So in short, is there a big difference between the Gx8 and S6?

none,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I was born in 93 and I always loved innovative features in games which I'd never seen before, they were magical at the time but in hindsight were so small. First is The Sims 1, it blew my mind that you could call other sims from your house phone and in Runescape 2 (2003~) I was sold when I saw you could light logs on fire! What are things that make you feel this way too?"
none,"So I like to try my luck at the bookies for LFC games. I really feel like it's going to be a repeat of the city match. They're gonna come at us and players like shelvey in midfield are going to lack the defensive discipline. I'd say 2-0 and coutinho to score any time. What's your predictions for scoreline, score first and score any time?"
none,"So I have only started watching and supporting LFC since 2011 and I havent had the privilege of seeing us play defensively well. I'm absolutely sick and fucking tired right now of hearing us admit we are defending poorly and need to make improvements when I never see any! So what do we have to do about it? When will we tangibly see a difference?! I first thought okay we need a new leader in our line, so we bought arguably the strongest leader last year in the league and to no avail! Can anyone with experience here tell me what we have to do?"
none,"So I just had a thought of a way to really save cash and get some decent nutrition, but I could use someone to help calculate this. To start with I would have 2 piece of brown bread (£1.30 from tesco I believe) with a banana. Next up we could buy a frozen bag of broccoli and cauliflower (£1 per bag) then you could make a tumeric curry with that, serving with brown rice (£1 per bag)In England, one can buy a 1kg whole chicken for £2.50 from Tesco. How about chopping the chicken into pieces, then making the remains into soup. How about soup everyday for lunch, then alternate days of roasted chicken (served with rice) and another day have a vegetable curry. I wonder how much that would cost overall per week."
none,"The hottest topic on Liverpool forums everywhere is our major full back issues. Moreno is a fine addition, as I believe an injury free Jose Enrique competing with a young promising full back will do have that position covered. Not to mention the fact that Emre Can/Sakho/Lovren have played there before too. It's the RB position that's scaring us. From the statistics I've seen on whoscored.com and from seeing him play, I can say Manquillo is very, very raw and it's not his fault, he's really young. Are we really putting our faith in a youngster who has never been outstanding in a senior match before to carry our RB issues? **TL;DR**, My only problem here is everyone seems content with bring Moreno+Manquillo in and one more striker, then we're done” We need to talk about how he might not be enough!"
none,Personally I think our present squad is great and every one could have a  role. However I'm interested to see if any one thinks players which we purchased when we did not have CL should be considered deadweight.

These are the first places we look for information if you can't communicate for whatever reason. This would include:* Your name and birth date* An emergency contact number or two* Any allergies you might have* Any health conditions/medical history* An up to date list of medications with dose and schedule* Any medical equipment you use, such as a cpap or insulin pump* The name and number for your GP/family doctor*  Insurance infoTime is everything in a medical emergency, and by providing this information you'll give your caregivers everything they need to treat you right away.

I'm still blown away that my surgeon led me into this with no preparation and no follow-up whatsoever. I mean, just a sheet of paper with post-surgery care instructions would have been great, dontcha think?I'm still having pain, but it's a lot more bearable. I had my first little walk yesterday and it felt great to get out into the spring air. I no longer live in fear of BMs; in fact, this whole thing has taught me to relax and take my time with the process. Your suggestions of baths and ice packs have been super helpful. Your advice gave me permission to slow down and let my wife take care of me. I'm too stubborn for my own good, and it really stressed her out watching me struggle to tough it out. She's been amazing.I'm still hurting, and the stitches are really bothering me, but the swelling is down. Did you have stitches that dissolved, or did you have to have them taken out? Did any of you have a low-grade fever after surgery? I called my GP about it and he just sent me to get a covid test. It passed after a couple of days. How long did it take for your sutures to fully heal? When is it safe to return to my normal daily activities? I really appreciate any info that you can send my way."

none,"I love corvids, I really do. But when I fill my bird feeders, huge flocks of crows, hooded crows, rooks, jackdaws, and magpies show up and eat every bit of food within minutes. I've had to get stronger feeders because they'll break the cheap ones open. I really like them, but they chase away all the smaller birds. And yes, it looks like there's a demon living in my house as there are corvids *everywhere*. Is there any way that I can feed the smaller birds as well without having every crow within 10 miles gobbling it up first? How would you handle this? Don't get me wrong; I don't mind feeding the corvids, I'd just like to see other birds at my feeder as well."

none,"I'm taking methotrexate for psoriatic arthritis. I had been using vimovo (naproxin/esomeprazole) pretty successfully to treat my pain, but my rheumo has advised against taking it because of its interaction with mtx. When I asked what I can take for pain, he kind of shrugged at me, saying that mtx should reduce my pain a lot.Well, it does a great job at reducing inflammation, but I also have a lot of pain from old injuries. Stretching and exercising daily helps, but I'm still in pain all the damned time. So those of you on mtx, what do you take for pain? How does it work for you?"
none,"Does someone have a voodoo doll? Am I being followed around by an invisible creature that's armed with an ice pick? I'll be minding my own business, not doing anything that would normally cause pain, and suddenly, BAM! Horrible stabbing joint pain. Normally it goes away after a few moments, but sometimes it lasts for a couple of days. Usually it affects my knees, hips, or hands. What the actual heck? I just started methotrexate a couple of weeks ago after an unhelpful six months on plaquenil, and I'm hoping that it helps. I can handle the constant ache, but the sudden pain thing is the worst. Do any of you have it? Do you have any idea how to prevent this?"
none,"Hello, entwives! I hope you're all having a fabulous Saturday. So I'm going to be harvesting my girls soon. I'm a little worried about drying them because it's super humid where I live. I have a food dehydrator that I use to make dog treats ('cause my puppy is the best), and I was wondering whether I could dry the flowers safely with it? I was thinking about putting it on the lowest setting and keeping a close eye on it. What do you all think? Have any of you tried this? My concern is that it might destroy terpenes that way."

I'm thinking about starting over in an active Trammel style freeshard with no pvp. Are there any active servers like that out there?"
none,"I'm on my third day of taking plaquenil, and I'm feeling pretty fatigued and my ears are ringing, which sounds pretty normal. I have a terrible, metallic taste in my mouth as well. Has anyone else experienced this? Does it go away eventually? I can't get rid of it."
none,"I have a lot of joint pain generally, and I get some redness and swelling in the joints of my hands. I've been diagnosed with osteo for several years. Today when I was getting out of my car, the metal part of the seatbelt gently banged against one of my knuckles. Normally, I wouldn't have noticed it. This time, I felt a searing, white hot pain that left me sitting in the car for several minutes after it happened. This happens to me every few months. Does anybody else get this kind of pain? Is it common for osteo? Is ice or heat better when this happens? Thanks for your input!"
none,"About 10 years ago I was diagnosed with osteo; it made sense because I've done a lot of hard physical labor along with years of martial arts.I'm noticing, though, that my pain has changed in the past couple of years. I'm still pretty achey, but I've noticed that I get these joint pains that feel almost like a bee sting feeling that goes on for hours sometimes. The pain is equal bilaterally. It tends to be worse when I'm either stressed or tired. Is this something that I should be concerned about, or is it the normal progression of osteoarthritis? I'm starting to get a little worried that this could be RA, but I don't want to waste my doctor's time if I'm just being paranoid. What do you think?"
none,"A little over 3 years ago I got the narc discard. I'd been with her for a long time because I cared about her kids, but hey, they were almost all launched, so why bother keeping me around? The sad thing is that she totally alienated me from the kids. It took a lot of therapy to help me deal with the 7 years of abuse that I endured with her. It took me about a year to stop saying, ""I'm sorry"" constantly. Since then I met Ms. Right, got married, and moved to another country. I'm very happy; my life is better than I ever imagined it could be. NEx still pokes at me from time to time, and I never answer her. She's tried offering to give me info on how the kids are doing, but only if I meet her for lunch; always the manipulator. Yesterday's message was all excited for me that I got married and moved to the EU. I can't believe that, after the shitty way that she discarded me, she thinks that I'll ever speak to her again.I still feel some pain and anxiety when I hear from her, but it's getting easier. I am so proud of myself for not falling for her attempts to draw me back in. I've avoided blocking her for all this time because of the kids, but I think it's time to let it go. I'm blocking her manipulative ass."
none,"Hello, dog people!Today my 10 pound rescue and I were on our walk, and we noticed a sweet looking knee-high pup at the local park with a couple of doting elderly owners. The dog looked pretty well-socialized and friendly, and both dogs related well through the fence, so I decided to humor my dog and go into the park.They seemed to play really well together; they took turns doing the butt sniff and peeing thing. There were play bows and parallel sniffing. They had a couple of nice runs together. I decided to walk to the other end of the park with my dog, and that's when the other dog struck.In a flash, everything changed and it grabbed my 10 pound dog's head. I thought for a split second that they might be playing rough, until my dog started screeching, and the attacking dog started to try to shake my guy. I called for help, then grabbed the attacking dog's back legs in an attempt to pull him off my guy like I read about here, but my guy is so small that the bigger dog just dragged him along. I dropped to my knees, grabbed my boy, put him under my arm like a football, and started trying to pry my dog's head out of his jaws. I put my thumbs into his mouth, found the TMJ, and pressed. The dog released my boy, bit me a few times for shits and giggles, backed off, then lunged at me almost knocking me to the ground. I was able to protect my boy until the other owner made it to us.I was in shock. I couldn't catch my breath for a while. I checked my dog, and although he was caked in mud and saliva, the only blood was my own. His eyes and ears were ok. Once I realized that we were ok-ish, all I could think about was getting home. I was in shock; I have a bit of a heart condition and it took me a while to be able to breathe normally. The other dog's owners were very sweet and concerned. Their pup was a rescue, and was brought up to date on his shots before they rescued him about 9 months ago according to their story. I was so wrecked I left without getting their contact info.My dog is sore but fine. I'm pretty bruised up, and unfortunately one of the bites broke skin. Should I be worried? Do you have any ideas of how I can find the other dog's owners? I think I might feel better if I had evidence of their dog's rabies shots. I don't want harm to come to either them or their dog, especially after our conversation about how their dog shouldn't ever go to dog parks and their promise to hire a behaviorist, but I'm a little nervous about being bitten like that. Do you have any advice for me? Should I go nuclear trying to find them, and if so, how?"
none,"Today I was walking in a mixed oak/open woodland along a small river near the Monterey Bay. We have a few species of hummingbirds that we see all the time, but I saw something different today. It was hanging out by some Mexican sage. It was a small-medium size, pretty uniformly green, and it had a very noticeable orange/yellow beak. I've been looking at field guides, and the closest thing I can find is a broad-billed hummingbird, but they don't come this far north. Does anybody have any ideas of what it could have been?"
none,"I was walking through a park today; it was mixed oaks next to a small river. I saw an unusual (for the area) hummingbird feeding on some Mexican sage flowers. It was pretty uniformly green; there was no bib that I could see. The thing that set it apart from our usual locals was that it had a bright orange/yellow beak. I've never seen anything like that before.I've been looking for it in all of my bird guides; the closest I can find in appearance is the broad-billed hummingbird, but it doesn't go any farther north than Arizona. Does anybody have any idea of what kind of hummer it was?"

none,"Hello. I have PTSD thanks to my long career in EMS. I rescued a dog about a year ago and he's an incredible help to me; he alerts me when I'm about to have a flashback, he wakes me from nightmares and comforts me, he makes sure I exercise every day, and he's so incredibly cute and friendly, he helps me interact with people constantly.I have some really good friends in Ireland, and since He Who Must Not Be Named was elected in the US, things are getting really uncomfortable for LGBT folks like me. I actually qualify for a visa there, and I'm hoping to move there this Summer.How can I get him there safely? I want to make sure that he can fly with me. I'm working on getting him a Euro Passport, but I'm massively stressed about the flight over. He's only 12 pounds, not the stereotype for a support dog. Flying is stressful to me, and I worry that I will Lose My Shit if he goes cargo. Are there airlines that go to Ireland that will honor his status as an ESA? I have a doctor's letter but no official designation. He's incredible at his job, but I've trained him to be the dog I need him to be, not always obedient; he's always outgoing, personable, and sweet, but he won't sit on command. I need him to be a brat to me when I'm having a flashback or dissociating, and I have injuries that prevent me from bending down, so he's trained to jump up instead of sitting. Will that be held against him? Seriously, he's saved my life. How can I make sure that we won't be separated?"

none,"I've been NC for more than a decade. My Nmomster spent most of my childhood abusing the shit out of me. My dad spent the entire time ignoring the fact that I was being tortured.I went NC more than a decade ago because every time I was in contact with them they turned it into another opportunity for abuse. Today on a whim I decided to google him. I discovered that he died last month. Of course, I had all the feels, because he was on the surface such a great dad and I loved him.But he was a dad that never once protected me from being abused, ever. I'd be getting the shit beaten out of me, and there he was, reading the paper in the next room like nothing was happening. Can you imagine what it's like to be getting the shit beaten out of you, all the while in sight of the person who should be saving you, and realize that they were completely ignoring what was happening? That was my dad in a nutshell.About an hour after I found out about this, I got a letter with my little brother's writing on the envelope. I had a really intense day in therapy yesterday and was pretty wrecked, so my wife offered to read it for me. I guess it was a total flying monkey letter sent to me before my dad died. She read it then threw it away.I'm having all the feels. I practically worshiped him at one time in my life. I wanted to grow up to be just like him, and so many of my good qualities came from his example. But he never once intervened to protect me... Of course, he's been memorialized like he was friggin' Mother Theresa. And he really did help a lot of people. Unfortunately, he never seemed to be there when I needed him.RIP, Ndad, you homophobic bastard. I hope you found the heaven that you preached about all these years. "

none,"I took my dog to a dermatologist for allergy testing because he's been so itchy that he's lost a lot of fur and suffered from ear infections.He's allergic to a number of plants, as well as dust, mites, feathers, and cats. My biggest shocker was that he's allergic to human dander. I had no idea that dogs could be allergic to humans! The sad thing is that he's about elebenty gazillion times more social with humans than me. I'll be giving him allergy shots for 6 months to a year. I can't tell you how relieved I am that this kind of therapy is so successful. And there's an oral med if you're shy about needles.Btw, this test would have cost us $1100 if we didn't have insurance. Our policy covered 80% of it. If you don't have pet insurance and you aren't rich, look into it because it can save you a lot of heartache in the long run."
none,"Last night, my dog shot out the back door. I was wearing a robe and slippers, but I was so worried he was chasing a skunk I took off after him. I tripped on the stairs, and ended up flying down the last 8 steps face-first. It happened so fast I didn't have the chance to tuck and roll.Anybody else would have broken their face upon landing. I, however, have a wonderful personal airbag system! I broke a couple of toes and sprained a finger, but otherwise I'm completely unscathed. Hooray for big boobs!!!"
none,"Hello!I have an adorable rescue, probably a longhair chihuahua mix, who I adopted in March. Mostly he's happy and well-adjusted, but he can be a drama queen. My wife, who would never knowingly  harm him, freaks him the hell out when she is petting him. At first he seems fine, then I notice him acting nervous, then he will cower and screech like she's trying to kill him.Her approach is to not stop giving him attention when he acts that way, but to continue to give him gentle attention. She doesn't want to reward him for freaking out, and she feels that it's encouraging him to respond like that if she stops right away.My attitude is that he's allowed to have boundaries, and that if he's upset by anybody touching him, they should stop immediately. I acknowledge that this is me projecting my beliefs onto my dog. So what's the best approach here? To stop petting him the minute he shows signs of stress, or to try to gently stay there with him while he freaks out in hopes of teaching him that things are ok? Is there something that I'm not getting here?"

none,"I finally saw Beyond. Did anybody else notice that the crew and Krall had this argument about the value of working together? The crew mentioned the power of working together numerous times. Krall went out of his way on a couple of occasions to denigrate the power of working together. But in spite of what he said, Krall's entire strategy was based on a huge swarm of ships...wait for it...working perfectly together. In fact, they worked together far better than the Enterprise crew did, really. Until the loud music came along. I enjoyed the movie, but was anybody else bugged by this?"
none,"Years and years ago, I noticed her. She ran the women's section of the local bookstore. She was silver haired even then, with piercing blue eyes and such a soft, intent, intelligent voice. I couldn't talk to her. Shit, I could barely look at her. If I needed help with a book and she was the only person available, I'd wait it out because I was too shy to talk to her.Years and years passed until our paths crossed again. This time, we were two fat old ladies. This time, I was therapised and older and ready to finally talk. We became friends. What a delightful woman! What a sense of humor! What depth, what goodness. My friend died yesterday, and I can't believe that she isn't on this earth anymore. I regret every moment that I was too shy to speak to her; I'm so sad that we missed out on all those years of friendship. I can't believe I'll never hear her laugh again.Is there a woman in your life who is too hot to talk to? Take a deep breath and introduce yourself. Behind all that gorgeousness there might be the makings of a dear friend. "
none,"I've written before about my crazy Nboss who answers to nobody before. I've been unable to quit, so my approach has been to grey rock the heck out of her. She talks shit behind my back and sabotages me at every turn, but I'm hanging on until I can find another job.Yesterday when I returned from lunch, a very upset volunteer met me at the door. I pulled her outside to calm her down, and she let me know that Nboss, who is a white woman, publicly berated two latino workers in a fake Mexican accent, and threatened to call their mothers, because ""Mexican mamas don't take that shit."" They had failed to do a task that had never been assigned to them in the first place. The boss has been going through some personal issues, and has been escalating her abuse of the two poor guys for the past week.There were four other people in the room, including customers. I calmed the volunteer, walked past the dragon's office, and encountered a huge wall of stress in our main work area. I quietly walked around and got stories from the folks involved, and had them write things down. I handed out a bunch of hugs, then went to my desk to write to the board. One of the guys involved had left in tears, and I told the other guy to go home with pay.And I sat there thinking, ""I can't sit here passively and let a racist act like that go unanswered. I can't let my coworkers suffer without saying something.""I have pretty severe PTSD. My doctor has been encouraging me to go on disability because of stress related illness caused by this asshole boss. She's the type that does lines of coke in her office, then yells and throws things at her employees. I was so anxious about confronting her that I was popping out in hives all over, but I took a few breaths and confronted her.I opened her door and said, ""Mary, I know you get frustrated with the guys. But as a white woman, you CANNOT berate them with a fake Mexican accent. It's racist, it's hurtful, and it casts a pall on this entire organization. DO NOT do that again.She immediately went on the attack. She vehemently denied it, then demanded to know who was in the room, exactly what she said, etc. I told her that she did it on 2 occasions today, that I wasn't there and didn't have the exact verbiage, and that I wasn't going to tell her who was there. I didn't let her drag me into an argument. I firmly told her it wasn't up to discussion, and that it couldn't ever happen again. Then I told her I was finished talking about it and I left the room as she DEMANDED that I send the latino guys to her office. I told her they had gone home for the day, then I walked out of her office as she yelled, and I shut the door. As I turned, I saw the employee who had left in tears walking back into the office. I grabbed him by an arm, marched him back outside, and told him to go home with pay because it wasn't a good time to be there. I didn't want angry boss cornering him for more abuse. About an hour later, boss calls me into her office; I'd done a big paperwork job for her, and turned in everything neatly early that day. When she called me in, the neat stacks of papers were scattered, and she accused me of turning in a mess, saying she couldn't find anything. Spock would have been proud; I calmly told her that when I turned in the paperwork it was in perfect order, and suggested that if she return it to order she could find what she was looking for. Once again I turned and left her office with her yelling to come back. Nothing like a little retaliation to spice up the day! I didn't see her for the rest of the day.I don't know what's going to happen today. Maybe this will shake up the board enough to force them to act. I'm going to take an emergency ativan with me today, and I think we'll all leave if she starts yelling and throwing things. Hopefully, the board will send her home for the day. Or forever. We'd all like that.This morning I'll be making sure that everybody is ok, including me. I'm thinking that I'll be taking my doctor's suggestion and going on leave for a while. I'm pretty shaken, and I'm expecting more retaliation (yes, getting it all in writing), but I'm pretty happy with how I handled everything."

none,"I adopted a little mixed-breed guy a few months ago. He came to me with a horrible case of diarrhea that took about a month of bland diet (boiled chicken and rice) to resolve. I managed to transition him to canned limited ingredient food, but I have to talk him into eating it. I've been trying to transition him to kibble, but he'll just not eat, like, for days, if he's not completely happy with what I'm feeding him. I've been playing a game with kibbles, pretending that they're treats, to try to get something into him.I'm giving him the highest quality canned food I can get my hands on, things like Natural Balance, Wellness, Canidae; if I change it up he stays interested. He won't eat the recommended amount for his weight.I worry about his health, but he seems to be a happy little guy. The vet thinks he's doing ok. When he was at the pound he failed his food guarding test, landing him on death row until a rescue group took him on. I used to leave him alone when he ate as a result, but I've found since then that he eats much more when I hang out and pet him.Do you have any suggestions for getting him away from a canned food diet to mostly kibble? How do you get your little dogs to eat?[Here's a photo of my little guy.](http://imgur.com/UlZYD90) I think he's mostly chihuahua with a bit of dachshund and I don't know what else. He's a little love monster!"
none,"I'm on year three of hot flashes, and haven't had a period in over a year. Mostly I'm doing ok with this natural post-menopause thing. I've been noticing something, and wonder if anybody else here experiences this. In the moment before a hot flash starts, my heart starts beating really fast, then I get a feeling of dread, and it triggers the hell out of my PTSD.My PTSD symptoms had been getting a lot better before the hot flashes started, but I hadn't put the two together until recently. So now, instead of letting myself get triggered when my heart starts to pound, I really try to stop and be mindful of it all. It seems to be helping a bit.Has anybody else here noticed a correlation between hot flashes and anxiety? What helps?"
none,"I adopted an adorable little rescue about 6 weeks ago. He came to me with terrible diarrhea and some vomiting, and we've been regular guests at the local vet hospital while everything gets cleared up. He didn't test positive for any giardia or anything, and after a lot of tests the vet just shrugged and said that my dog had been through a lot of changes and was adjusting.The last time I tried to transition him from chicken and rice to a decent quality kibble (Natural Balance) very gradually, he immediately relapsed. His poops are pretty normal now, and I need to start getting something more nutritious into him. I've started adding a little cooked carrot, but I'm a little lost. What's the best way to transition him? And what, in your opinion, is the best brand/type of dog food for a little guy with a delicate constitution?For some background, he's a 2 year old medium hair mixed breed (maybe chi/pom). His teeth are great, he's been dewormed, treated for fleas and heartworm, and vaccinated. He was neutered right before I adopted him. He'd been running loose on the streets of a farm town in the central valley of California in the US for a while. He weighs 11 pounds, and he's eating and drinking well right now. His only other issue is that he's pretty itchy, but there's no sign of any skin infection or fleas. He's very active and playful, just an all around awesome little gent."

none,"I work in a California dispensary. I've been pretty sure for a while now that the owner has a cocaine issue. Recently, a patient walked into her office without warning and caught her in the act of doing a few lines. So now we know for sure that there is usually cocaine at our business.I won't go into the misery of working for a coke head. My concern is this; if my boss is bringing cocaine into the dispensary, does this put me in any kind of risk legally? As tightly as dispensaries are regulated at the moment, isn't this a big no no? And if I decide to leave the job due to legal risk, could I qualify for unemployment? I don't want to get arrested."

none,"I loved IBM laptops back in the day. When suddenly they were Lenovo I was dubious, but quality continued to be really good. My latest is an E420 that I've had for quite a few years. I never felt that the quality of this laptop lived up to that of its predecessors, but it ended up serving me well for a long time.But the poor thing is acting up these days, and I'm starting to think about a replacement. I need a pretty robust business machine; I travel a lot, and use powerpoint and Photoshop all the time. I do tons of social media. I know that these are minor things, but I love my trackpoint and I could really use something with a lighted keyboard. I do a lot of graphics, so I need something that can handle large files easily. My current laptop has a fingerprint scanner, and it saves me some time when logging onto my laptop; I'd keep it but it isn't a dealbreaker. And when I'm in a strange town I like to watch netflix instead of my hotel tv service. I don't want a huge screen, but a good quality one would be nice. And I type too much to settle for a tablet.

none,"I'm an RBN survivor with a nice case of c-ptsd from an abusive childhood and a long career in EMS.I took a job at a small nonprofit led by a charismatic leader because I needed the job, it was in a field I wanted to move into, and the organization helped a lot of people. Oh, man, was that a mistake. It didn't take long for me to notice that she was a classic narc. The triangulation, gaslighting, scapegoating, love-bombing etc. started pretty much immediately. Her favorite game is to give you a big urgent project with very vague instructions and no measurable outcome, then refuse to clarify anything, then to totally move goal posts and criticize what you produce, then scrap everything. She's unpredictable, verbally abusive, and controlling.My co-workers and I really believe in the organization, and love the people we're serving. We do a lot to shelter each other from the worst of evil bosses abuse, and we have a great little culture in spite of her.Recently my wife and I started a side business that's similar to, but not identical to, the nonprofit that my narc runs, because there's a huge need out there for what we're doing. We've done everything with a whole lot of integrity, and I've been completely upfront with the Nboss about everything. We offer exactly zero threat to the organization I'm working for.The Nboss ignored us for a few months, then she started hearing about my new company through the grapevine. One of the thousands of members of her nonprofit decided to work with us.And then the Nboss started to have personal problems, completely unrelated to what I'm doing, that might make her lose control of the nonprofit. Suddenly she's gone into a defcon 5 attitude about me and my wee little business. I went to a work related conference last week with her written permission, and she spent the whole time loudly and publicly slandering me and claiming that I abandoned my job to go. She publicly undermines me at every opportunity; last night at 11pm she sent the entire board a message about how I didn't announce an event that she didn't tell me about. She's gaslighting at every opportunity. She tried to get us all to sign a nondisclosure/non-competition agreement that was totally illegal, then she threatened to hold our paychecks hostage until we did; I had to threaten her with legal action to derail it. The list of her stupid, vicious bullshit goes on forever, and right now I'm the target of all of it.I need to quit. I want to quit. But the org works with very vulnerable people and I care about them so much that I don't want to leave them. I'm the one who keeps everything calm and orderly there, and I feel like I'd be betraying everyone by leaving. I truly, deeply care about these people. While it's going to be a while before the new biz can support me, the chaos and upset of dealing with Nboss is leaving me so drained I don't have the energy to work on my dream as much as I should be. What I need to do is get out, work on my dream, and hire as many of my wonderful coworkers away from that place as I can.I hate it that I'm back in this trap; first an Nmother, then a few N relationships, then fucking crazy Nboss. I really need to get over my attraction to assholes. I am so, so tired of being fucked with. Thanks for listening. :("
none,I'm just waiting to get on my plane for Denver to go to the conference. Will any other entwives be there? We should have a meetup.
none,"I work for a great nonprofit in CA. Our director has decided she wants us to sign a non disclosure/non-competition agreement that stipulates that we won't work in the same field for a year if we quit, among other things.I've let her know that I won't be signing it. She has now sent out an email stating that we won't get paid until we turn it in. Can she legally hold our paychecks to force us to sign an agreement?Update: Thanks everybody!The first thing I did was to take advantage of my wife's legal insurance, and I hired an employment lawyer.Yes, my boss doesn't know what the hell she's doing. I had a gentle little chat with her about it, and pointed out the parts of the contract that were illegal. She tried to insist that we sign the document as is ""until her lawyer has the chance to look at it."" I asked her to call him for his advice before she did something that would get her in hot water with the feds. And it worked. She's backed down. I would have loved to hear her conversation with her lawyer, that's for sure.I left it with the old, ""give me the finished one and I'll sign it if my lawyer OKs it."" Hopefully something more sane will come out of it, but there isn't a lot of sanity here. Thanks so much for your advice."
none,Hello! I'm looking for a lounge bra; something stretchy without an underwire that I can wear around the house. Sports bras are a little more support than I'm looking for; I can't tolerate a lot of compression. I just want a little support while I hang out in my loungewear. What's the most comfy thing out there for big girls like me?
none,"This came up in another post, and I thought it would be a good idea to start our own thread so we don't hijack their conversation. Do you feel that you were treated differently? I was the middle kid, the only girl with two non-adopted boys. Nmom was very clear that she only adopted me so my brother would have a companion and so she would have a little girl to dress up. The resentment I endured from her, and the way she encouraged my brothers to torture me, was epic. I grew up with the constant threat of being taken back to the children's home; once while we were out running errands, she swerved into the parking lot of the county children's home and told me to get out. I was maybe 6 or 8? Old enough to nonchalantly get out of the car, say ok, then start walking toward the front doors as she screamed for me to get back in the car because her trick was backfiring. When she got me home she beat the living daylights out of me for being a smartass, but that was one of the first times I decided to take a little power for myself. It was worth the beating because she never did that again.If you were adopted, was it held against you as well?"
none,"I'm a big believer in the fact that seatbelts save lives, unless you have big boobs. It doesn't matter how I adjust my seatbelt, it always ends up across my throat. How is that safe? I've always been concerned that if I were in an accident my seatbelt would crush my trachea, so I wear my shoulder strap under my arm, which also isn't terribly safe. Because of course, seatbelts were designed by and for men.[This Onion article](http://www.theonion.com/article/chrysler-halts-production-of-neckbelts-810) sums it up pretty well.Does anybody know of any adaptive seatbelts for women that I could have installed in my car?"
none,"40HH here, full breasts, not terribly narrow root. I'm looking for a good, basic non-padded bra that isn't too... Frufru I guess? I'm a lot more interested in fit and feel than looks.

none,"Hello, Raptors! I have a conundrum. I really need to start exercising more. I love the water, and swimming would be wonderful for me and my bad knees.I'm having a major stumbling block, though; I feel utterly ridiculous and uncomfortable in women's bathing suits. As a fat butch, the entire experience of wearing women's anything leaves me wanting to cry, and bathing suits are the worst of the worst when it comes to humiliation.So what's a gal to do? Are there any butch swimwear options out there? How can I hit the pool without looking and feeling awful?"
none,"About a decade ago, my GC brother showed up at my house unannounced as a flying monkey. How could I desert my family?  I got pissed, yelled at him, told him to get lost. He cried. Triggered, I fled and went into hiding for the week he was in town.He was always a good kid, a lovable brother. But he never seemed to get it; as a blonde, white, straight, christian male, he didn't get how fucking terrible it was in our household for me. He tried and tried to talk me into pretending that everything was ok. Today is his birthday, and I miss him so much and really regret hurting him. But I can't figure out how I can have him in my life. Jason, I miss you and wish I could send you a happy birthday today. "
none,"Hey. I went to the doctor today for a checkup and mentioned something subtle; I get this little tight achey feeling in my jaw sometimes when I'm bicycling to work. She listened, and felt that there was a little gallop in my pulse, so she sent me to the ekg lab. They found that I have a problem with the way the electrical signal in my heart works; it could be a tiny thing or it could be really bad. I have a ton of tests ahead of me, and it's all really scary.So I could use a few good vibes right now. I'm feeling weepy and really stressed out. I just got married this Summer and the thought that I might not be around to enjoy it is really freaking me out."

none,"I work at a small nonprofit that works with sick and dying people; over the years, a few thousand people have come through our doors, and we suspect that a group of them liked us well enough to hang around after they died. We have regular activity that we haven't been able to explain away, things that have been witnessed by several people at a time with no explanation.One evening a couple of weeks ago, our staff of five locked everything up and went to the top story of our two story building for a meeting. We were up there for at least half an hour, and everything was locked up tight downstairs. We aren't in the best neighborhood, so when I say that we were locked up tight, I mean that not even a breath of air could make it into that place. At the end of the meeting, my coworker John was walking down the stairs ahead of me when I saw him stop and look confused. When I asked him what was wrong, he said he smelled something, but couldn't describe it. By the time I reached him it had dissipated, so we shrugged and continued into the back room, a 20x20 windowless space.About midway across the room, I was hit by a super strong smell of body odor. It smelled like a guy who hadn't bathed in several days, and it was intense. I called John over, and he confirmed that he had smelled the exact thing at the bottom of the stairs. It was a sharply defined area of concentrated reek about 2' in diameter and six feet or so high. After a moment it dissipated completely. We searched the place but found no intruder. There are no vents to the outside in that room; it's completely sealed. As an isolated incident, I'd be more likely to say that it was nothing. But a lot of us have been touched and whispered at. We get a lot of talking in empty rooms and the occasional yell; it seems to be a bit of a mimic as well. And stuff gets thrown in the kitchen; we've witnessed things that were secured, such as a butcher knife in the dish drainer, fly across the room. People see shadows from time to time, but I don't know if they're just seeing things. As long as I'm not alone there I find it all to be very interesting but not terribly frightening; something new happens every few weeks, so there's a lot to document. As long as our patients feel safe I'm not terribly worried about it. But the smell! I've never experienced that before. Have you? How you debunk a smell in a sealed room?"
none,"I hope it's ok to post this here. I can't count the number of times, when I was growing up in my Narc home and for years after, when I felt that everything sucked and I didn't want to be alive anymore. I've seen a lot of despair here, and so many of us go through periods of wanting to give up. [Here is a checklist to use](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6A2F5ky9SELU0Zfd05YMEpyNUk/view?pli=1) when you are despairing. I hope that you find it useful; I certainly do."
none,"I have been so hooked on this show for the first four seasons. I'm about a quarter way through season five and... Meh. Lots of rehashing old villains. Amy Pond is likable enough, but Matt Smith just feels a little flat to me. And the writing isn't as engaging; so many of the episodes before were terrifying or gut-wrenching, but so far this season has just been meh for me. Are the writers American at this point? Is the show going to regain its old intensity, or is this just what the show becomes? Or am I going through New Doctor Adjustment Syndrome? "

none,"I've used cannabis daily for years to control my PTSD. Really, it's miraculous how well it works; it completely stops my nightmares and flashbacks. Well, I got the chance to go to Ireland for a couple of weeks,  a lifelong dream of mine,  and I'm on my 3rd tree-free day. Because I work in a politically active cannabis clinic, I worried that I'd get targeted at the airport. Of course, I ended up with the luggage search and a very thorough pat down, so I'm glad that I listened to my instincts and left my trees at home. I'm loving Ireland; this is the trip of a lifetime. But I feel like I have no skin. I really didn't need a tolerance break. Meditation is helping a bit, but ugh! Why can't this be legal everywhere? I'd love to head out to a stone circle and smoke out. How do you all handle travel?"
none,"Almost a year ago, my N dumped me with no warning because I had lunch with a friend and I forgot to mention it to her. A dear old friend took me in and supported me until I could get back on my feet. We've totally fallen for each other since then and life is just wonderful. When I first moved into this gorgeous old house the front yard was overgrown and the paint was peeling. We got a loan to have the front porch rebuilt and the house painted. We cleared out the yard, and with all the work done, the place looks amazing. Our neighbors love it. Nex wanted to drop something by my workplace the other day; we have been mostly NC, but she has been behaving herself so I gave her permission. She came in like the little storm cloud that she is, complaining bitterly about the colors of my house. Yeah, it's a very cheery yellow with dark red and green trim. It suits the architecture and the neighborhood perfectly. She went on her rant about the house colors for some time, eventually asking me to change them. I stood there smiling the entire time, and replied, ""sure, we'll totally repaint our house in colors that you prefer. When will be dropping off some swatches?""  She actually paused in her monologue for a moment because she couldn't decide whether I was being serious. Like we actually care what she thinks about the color of our house! The rest of her visit was fine. It's such a blissful feeling, coming home to my cheery yellow house full of love and happiness every day! Recovering from the relationship with the Nex has been a rocky road, but she no longer has power over me.  I couldn't be happier. "

none,"One tool that's been really helpful in my recovery from N abuse has been mindfulness meditation. A therapist introduced me to it many years ago, and it's so useful for calming and self-awareness. This is from a Buddhist website and some of the terminology might be unfamiliar, but for those of us who tend to be alienated from our own minds and bodies, this might be a good read. http://www.wisdompubs.org/blog/201502/mindful-well-being-checklist"

I'm sane, friendly, super mellow, and I have many trees to share. "
none,"If you are an old-school geek who loves Heinlein, you know that grokking comes from the practice of sharing water. Robert A. Heinlein originally coined the term grok in his 1961 novel Stranger in a Strange Land as a Martian word that could not be defined in Earthling terms, but can be associated with various literal meanings such as water"", ""to drink"", ""life"", or ""to live"", and had a much more profound figurative meaning that is hard for terrestrial culture to understand because of its assumption of a singular reality."" (thanks, wikipedia)It's come to mean ""to understand another person on a profound level."" But it's base meaning is ""to share water.""We've started to use the term, ""brokking"" in my household. You know when you're smoking a bong together, and you draw a bigger hit than you can handle, and you save it for the other person to inhale? It's sharing smoke; we call it brokking. 'Cause you only share smoke with people who are really close to you.Cause you know what?   I brokk you, man. *-)"

none,"It's been a week since I left my Npartner. It happened very suddenly and I was lucky to have landed in a wonderful new home. Even though I'm living with two other sane, middle-aged gals who are very kind, I'm still afraid that if I do anything wrong all hell will break loose. I still find it hard to break the ex's ridiculous rules about how the house should be kept. I'm trying to be cool about it, and to be gentle with myself. One of my new housemates has been a good friend for a couple of decades, and has told me that she knows that it's going to take a while to get used to the lack of stress. There's no constant stream of criticism and complaining here. I'm allowed to do things like wear a bathrobe or read a book. I don't have to constantly tour the house looking for anything that might set off the Nrages. I can finally breathe. And you know what? I'm starting to think that I'll be able to live a life that brings me happiness and peace. "
none,"I've been with my Npartner for nearly seven years now; I've been parenting her 4 kids and generally giving the family my all this entire time. We've had our ups and downs, but things started to get really bad when I was laid off last winter. I continued to pay her rent and buy all of our food, and I took on all the house and yard work while I looked for a job.She started to become downright abusive. I went into therapy and doubled down on my job search. Last night I was in bed, half asleep, when she discovered a receipt that had fallen to the bedroom floor. She asked me in that quiet ""I'm about to lose my shit"" voice when I had been out to lunch at a cafe downtown. Sleepy and freaked out, I couldn't remember. That's when her claws came out... She called me a liar, then just started to tear into me verbally.I remembered eventually that yes, I took a buddy out to lunch a couple of weeks ago. But by then Ngal was deep into her shitstorm and not listening to me at all. She eventually came to bed.This morning as I was packing for a retreat, she told me that I shouldn't bother coming home unless we had a long, serious discussion about why I am such a liar. This would be the third time she's kicked me out of the house in a year.I left without saying a word. I called a friend who had a room available for rent and told her that I'd take it. I'm not giving the N-ex any indication of my moving out until I get home from my retreat on Monday. She'll be at work then, so I should be able to move most of my things before she can get home. I'm really worried that she'll steal and destroy as much as she can.I'm numb, but I'm free. I don't have to walk on eggshells anymore. My therapist is going to be so proud of me!"

none,"I've been in a relationship with an N for six years; there are kids involved so I'm not comfortable leaving.How do your Ns handle housework? I am unemployed right now, so I've somehow been saddled with all of the housework. Today my N is taking a day off from work, and she's decided to do a little cleaning. This is how she rolls:Cleaning the fridge- Take any food that might be expired and leave it on the counter for me to deal with. Complain loudly about how dirty the fridge is, even though I just cleaned it a week ago. Brag about her epic fridge cleaning.Cleaning the deck- With a broom, sweep anything that she doesn't want on the deck into the back yard, breaking things. Expect me to clean everything in the back yard. Brag about her epic deck cleaning.Dusting- Discover a week-old cobweb in an area that I dusted a week ago. Demand to know why I never clean up the cobwebs, insist that I never cleaned it in the first place. Brag about her epic dusting.When finished-- Complain bitterly about how dirty the house is (I clean, mop, and dust very thoroughly on a weekly basis), and insist that I hire and pay for a house cleaner because clearly I don't know what I am doing; if she were unemployed this house would be spotless.Do you go through stuff like this with the Ns in your life?Youngest kid is 16 now; as soon as he's safely off to college I am so out of here."
none,"I've been with my partner for almost 7 years now, and the abuse/hoovering/gaslighting has left me feeling like a confused wreck. I decided to start therapy to help me figure out what to do. I knew that if I didn't tell my N about the therapy and she found out about it, there would be hell to pay. I thought it might also go badly if I told her as well; I just can't win. I told her this evening that I had my first session with the therapist this afternoon. She started out by making appropriate comments, then asked to know what I'd talked about in therapy today. I told her I didn't feel comfortable talking about it. And so it began. I'm unreasonable, I never talk to her, she doesn't want to be in a relationship with somebody who never tells her anything, maybe I should move out. (I would have years ago but there are kids involved)I think I'm going to be putting up with her nonsense after every therapy session until I decide that I'm fed up and move out.Am I being ridiculous?

She doesn't like this friend because he just isn't interesting to her, and she hates the movie we're going to watch. Nonetheless, after telling her I had to listen to a half-hour rant about how inconsiderate I am to only invite people over when she isn't here. I don't invite people over because she always has a major meltdown about it. Ugh; just ugh. Am I being selfish for wanting to have one decent birthday? "

none,"This morning Nathan Phelps, Fred's nephew, announced that Fred is in the hospital and near death. Fred Phelps was the infamous pastor of the Westboro Baptist ""Church.""I think we should organize a big fat lgbt rally at his funeral. There should be lots of rainbows and drag queens and loud music and gratuitous nudity and laughter and dancing and kids with balloons and face paint. There should be a kiss-in, and choirs should sing. We should mark the end of his hateful life with joy, love, and exuberant celebration.In a way I'm grateful for the old man; he put a face on hatred and the extremity of his actions probably made more folks realize that anti-lgbt hatred is an ugly thing.

All that mellow gave me the ability to let a lot of unkindness roll off my back. I'm feeling pretty sad about it, and haven't yet decided what I'm going to do about it. Will I just go back to my lovely green medicine once I find a job and settle for a relationship that is hurtful? My partner has no interest in changing the negativity in our relationship, and seems to feel that I deserve to be treated this way; I'm walking on eggshells all the time. I'm not perfect, but I work hard to provide a happy home life and I'm very kind and gentle. Don't I deserve something better?I know that a lot of people experience this when they stop using substances.

none,"Last year in July I sustained a electric shock to my neck while doing some electrical work. It was only for a couple seconds and it was low voltage 120v household current.I have zero vision loss,vision problems or eye pain.My ongoing complaint is that in my left eye, the lateral corner of my eye & upper eyelid have a constant odd sensation of numbness and foreign body sensation. I have tried my best to just ignore this and that the issue will resolve itself over time. Nearly a full year has passed and issue is still ongoing. After a significant amount of personal research my only conclusion is that the electric shock caused some sensory nerve damage which is causing the discomfort. I still have not seen a specialist about this problem. Does the nature of this problem justify taking the time and money going to see an ophthalmologist to find anything wrong that then could be treated?Regards,Chris"

I am about 2-3 years away from getting my Bachelors and all prerequisites. I'm just trying to plan ahead the best I can so I know I'm on the right path.

none,For over a year I've had this issue where no matter what I cannot connect to my college website (bb.cod.edu) I can connect just fine through a 4G connection off my phone but off my network it simply will not work. I've ran both tracert/ping and both fail to reach the school server. The device does not matter either. Every tablet/laptop/PC in my house will not reach the website if it's connected to wifi. Does this mean comcast physically changed their infrastructure in my neighborhood somehow that I cannot reach the school website through their service? Any insight or advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated.
none,Have a lightly used Titan X Pascal that has been under water since August 2016. Has served me flawlessly ever since I got it. Overclocks 100% stable to 2050-2075mhz. +200 core +450 mem. Card has the EKWB Clear Nickel Plated Acrylic Waterblock & Silver backplate. Note: block is prefilled so if you wish you to integrate into your custom loop then you will have to drain it. I will ship at no cost & will provide original box and stock cooler. Looking to get about 950$ out of it. Price is firm and I will not go any lower than that.

none,"It's been solidly established at this point that the main thematic driver of the whole series is ‘balance' (duh!) and everything mako and korra's relationship has gone through is to that end - achieving balance. Neither of them know how to be in a relationship: Mako especially had huge problems balancing being a supportive boyfriend and being an individual (saying what he thinks, not what he thinks she wants to hear) and Korra recognized that at the end of B2, which is why she ended it. Korra herself needs balance in the same kind of way, between her dedication/attachment to her Avatar role and her own actualization as a person separate from that role.They basically laid it out for you in Peacekeepers - they were unable to successfully balance their jobs and their relationship, because of all those reasons above. The fact that Mako and Korra fought during their relationship is not an indication that their relationship is doomed to fail but a thematically important part of their characterization and indicative of the need for growth: they need to balance themselves before they can be in a relationship together.source - http://vvivaa.tumblr.com/post/97741801926/mako-and-asami-should-get-back-together-they-got-along"

none,"Hello, I am a 20 year old male who has been experiencing urinary problems for the first time in my life. My symptoms are the constant urge to urinate, increased urinary frequency, and pain/burning when not urinating. It ranges anywhere from once every 2 hours to once every 30 minutes, and at night i have to get up 2-3 times to go to the bathroom. I have been experiencing these symptoms for about 4 weeks now. This is also the second time within the past 6 months this has happened. The first time was back in March this year and these symptoms lasted for about three weeks, without treatment or any kind of medication. After visiting my doctor in both instances, my urine samples/cultures ,std tests have come up negative. Additionally I was put on a week of cipro just in case the second time around but it has not helped relieve my symptoms at all. I have decreased my intake of caffeine, spicy foods, and been drinking herbal teas, cranberry juice, lots of water etc. but this has not helped either.  I am at a loss and I am wondering if I should go ahead and see a urologist to undergo further testing. Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
none,"After seeing the new GRID+, I thought it would also make perfect sense for NZXT to make something similiar but specifically designed for LED control. With all new cases like the H440 that no longer have a HDD cage, makes it a pain to set up something like the existing HUE requiring you to open up your case anytime you would like to change colors, modes etc.  Ideally it should be able to interface with the existing RBG Hue strips that could be bundled with it, also it should have support for the NZXT single color strips, with the pci bracket on/off/ brightness functionality integrated into the CAM software.

After seeing NZXT's all new sexxxy H440 case I have been inclined to refresh my build which has been the same for the most part for over a year now with the exception of the GPU & Memory which were both purchased a few weeks ago. My goal with this build is to build a gorgeous Red & Black themed powerhouse pc with a focus on aesthetics, silence and most importantly impeccable cable management both in the front and rear. The fact that one of NZXT's main staple features within the H440 is being extremely cable management friendly is one of the biggest things that caught my eye other than the prefabbed psu shroud, NO OPTICAL CAGE, instant dual 360mm rad support when I decide to watercool in the future and lastly the cases simple sleek look.

none,"With the immense popularity of your all new H440 mid tower case, I was thinking that it would be a smart idea to release a Full Tower version sometime, that will not be as aggressively/competitively priced and be in the price range of your Phantom 630/820 series cases. This would be a ZERO compromises case so this means the highest quality paint, maybe integrated fan control, separate switches for back i/o and PSU lighting, unfortunately the logo really isnt that high quality and after a week mine has become extremely dim. You can tell its not properly backlit just one or two little leds are illuminating it out of the bottom left/right corners of the NZXT logo. So a proper full RGB led panel would definitely be nice. Moving on the colored trims should be full metal or at least painted on the inside. I had to use masking tape in order to prevent the light from the power led light shining through the trim in my Black/Red case. In terms of watercooling support enthusiasts/reviewers didn't like how you can mount a 360mm rad on top or in the front but not both at the same time. With a full tower version there would definitely be more than enough room for this to be possible. For example adding the option to mount 4x120mm rads/3x140mm rads in top and front would be ideal. Also there would be significantly more room to place your Res/Pump as with the H440 your options are pretty limited. Lastly cable management could be improved by increasing the space in between the motherboard tray/ back panel cover due to the sound dampening foam. Essentialy I'm envisionving the [Phanteks Enthoo Primo](http://www.phanteks.com/Enthoo-Primo.html) but with a badass NZXT makeover.

We did very well though.But now we are finally heading towards the tropics and we expect to spend much longer amounts of time in the bush, especially as our bikes are intended for aggressive off-road terrain.Has anyone taken the NOLS Wilderness First Responder (WFR) course and knows of a place where I could gain access to the resources provided by the course?^(\*)See map of route here: [https://imgur.com/a/Ssrrfi2](https://imgur.com/a/Ssrrfi2)"

No spices.**Month 2:** Every morning my body begins to automatically initiate a movement. Right when this happens there is a sharp burning sensation, as if the wound is re-opening up.

Any advice on how to do this?(I read the sticky but wasn't able to figure out if my problem is covered.)"

Does anyone have any other options they'd recommend?"
none,"Last night, I used **Hennessy's Jungle Expedition Zip** hammock for the first time. I am not an expert hammock sleeper, so please correct me if my errors are unfounded. I was super excited for the hammock and spent a few days testing it out before spending my first evening in it.  Despite this, here is what I found:1. Uncomfortable!I am 5'11 and weight 180lbs, yet the hammock didn't seem to fit me properly. While laying asymmetrically as recommended (with a straight ridgeline and thus the recommended 30 degree hang angle), the right side of my body was put under an uncomfortable amount of tension. I tried adjusting things – my forward and backward position in the hammock, the tautness of the ridgeline, the hammock hang angle, and I even watched a video on how to remove the tension lines in your hammock body material using your feet. Nothing I tried removed that tension.My head was forced so close to the bug screen that I was frequently woken by the alarming and high-pitched anthem of mosquito song. My right leg was forced into a locked position against the hammock body which prevented me from falling asleep. I didn't wake up sore, but I only slept for about half the night.2. Hammock body obscures canopy view.\- When lying asymmetrically as recommended, the hammock material on one side of me was caused to distend upward, blocking a nice part of my otherwise wonderful view. Is this just the cost of having an asymmetrical hammock? Seems strange.3. Very little airflow\- The bug screen blocks a great portion of the air flow. This doesn't seem to make sense for a jungle tent where things are often very warm, as they were for me. 4. Irksome rigging systemThe rigging system seems unnecessary to me. Using only a rope and then weaving it four times through the webbing loops takes a while, and is especially annoying if you want to make a small adjustment to your ridgeline tension. I'll be looking for something with carabiners.5. The snakeskinsThese may make things easy to unpack, but don't pack up the system very efficiently, can block your rainfly from expanding along the ridgeline when your trees are relatively close, attract critters, and will accumulate water on their insides when it rains. These may be great for the ""adventure racing"" conditions for which they were designed, but I don't understand why these are so admired.6. The Bubble Pad is awesome.\- All that being said, the **Radiant Double Bubble** works and fits really well. I'll be keeping that."

The problem I have is I kinda like this girl and she likes me too apparently But my mind is telling me I cannot ever be with her because 1 she is still heavily attached to her ex boyfriend and 2 she has had a crush on my best friend for over a year, it should be added that best friend has no romantic interest in her at all and he was the one to introduce me to her after I came out of a long term relationship to help get me back on the horse.My question is what do I do now? Is it possible to go ahead with this i dont think it is and I took her to the zoo and out for ice cream and stuff, I did not do this necessarily as a date idea but more so because I generally like going places and she just happened to be with me and now I think she has taken it the wrong way.I do really like her company and think she is an amazing beautiful woman and I want to know her still and continue with the casual sex with have been having, She is really fragile and easily upset and has been fucked around by alot of blokes From the outside world everyone thinks we are a couple and I have no idea what to do Please reddit give me some answers, thankyou"

none,I really love my girlfriend and we have been dating for 2 and a half years and we both are 17 but lately I can't shake the thought that I'm missing out on my teen years. I'm really conflicted because I love her so much but at the same time I don't know what I'm feeling sometimes.  Sometimes I get a little worried that down the road when I'm older I will regret not going to parties and talking to other girls and not having to worry about every little thing I say or do in order to keep my girlfriend happy. It gets tiring making sure I'm doing everything right to be a good boyfriend. It just seems like sometimes it gets to be to much and I wonder if I'm to young to be in a serious relationship. But at the same time I can't imagine breaking up with her and seeing the sadness on her face when I tell her I think we should split up. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I love her so much but I feel like I'm missing out on what being young is like. I hope it doesn't come off as me sounding like a bad guy. Any advice is appreciated
none,"A few years ago, one of the reasons I don't like taking psychedelics at night, I took 200 ug and everything was going pretty good.  I was watching my show and things started to get weirder of course and because lsd alters how we view time before I knew it, it was already 1:00 in the morning. I decided I wanted things to get weirder so I took out a little joint I had saved for a while and snuck outside to take a few puffs off it because I knew not to overdo it with the weed when tripping. I came back and my mind felt like it was melting and I began spiraling down a path of terrible anxiety, the type that makes you want to curl up in a ball. I noticed both my dogs on the other couch in my living room just staring at me from across the room and shivering like he was scared or something and he definitely wasn't cold because they always does that when I trip or smoke a lot of weed. But this time it was a little weirder because my dogs started pacing back and fourth and actually growling at each other but in an aggressive way they do not usually do ever. Every time I would get near them or pet them, they would act uncomfortable and move to the other side of the room like they didn't want to be near me. Eventually one of them threw up and was shivering so much at that point with his ears laid back while staring at me. My other dog, anna was staring at the wall and seemed to be following something with her eyes and not long after, my other dog was doing the same. I don't know how long after, a paper slowly slid off the table and I was like wtf?! And as I was on my way out of that room because fuck that, another one slid off the table.

none,"So In 9th grade I fell in love with lsd and psychedelics and how little people knew about them. I became extremely interested in psychedelics and was researching them and how they affect your brain. But I feel like I did it to often and to many times. I'm currently 16 years old now and in 11th grade and it just feels like I became to aware of everything around me and what I feel. I have visual snow that hasn't gotten any better which sucks because it feels like I have a static cover over my vision at all times and when I focus on it, it gets worse.  I really don't know how to explain it and whenever I talk about hppd with people and how I think I messed up my brain they look at me like I'm crazy.  A way to describe it is it feels like something that used to be in my brain is now gone and something that didn't used to be there is just there now.  I feel like I've somehow been shown to much.  I noticed I'm way more aware of things that happen in my body and mind and it's like my brain is more connected than it used to be and not always in a good way. I feel like some emotions have been dulled and some are more intense. It also feels like I'm fuzzy headed all the time now.  And sometimes it scares me if I think to hard about it. I don't know who I should talk to this about so I'm just looking for any thoughts on this. I've done acid about 15 times in a 6 month period back in freshman year in high school. Sorry if it feels like my thoughts are scattered I don't really talk about this very much. Any help is appreciated."
none,Every time I take a strong benzo the next day I have bags under my eyes and something about my eyes just looks a lil off. I have even got comments from family members about how my eyes made me look a lil sick.
none,So far I know that nicotine affects GABA but does it produce GABA or act against it? I took a bar not to long ago and when I hit my juul i seemed to not feel the effects as much from the nicotine and I was thinking well yea of course it's because its a stimulant but if I'm not mistaken nicotine also has a depressant effect to so I read a few articles saying that nicotine does affect GABA but I am still unsure in what way. If I had a slight tolerance to a benzo and I hit my juul everyday for a month would my tolerance to benzos be affected?
none,"If so how much cross tolerance is there? If I've been taking say 2 mg alprazolam every day, will my tolerance to the flualprazolam be exactly the same? Given that I'm taking the equivalent dose to however much alprazolam you've been taking.  Just a side question...how much flualprazolam is equal to clonazalam and which is stronger?"
none,"(((https://imgur.com/a/rqojfH5)))I just picked up these b707's and they are obviously a lot smaller than they should be (both pressed whites for size comparison) so I took 1/4 of one to see how they hit and they sorta felt like a benzo and they made me feel slow and stupid so I'm just wondering, the size of the pill doesn't determine the strengthof the pill right? It was rumored the whites were clonazalam and my plug said not to take more then 1 of the blue bc I will black out bars so that's a good sign right? What do u guys think most likely contain? It felt for the most part like a benzo and I didn't get that extreme sleepiness from opiates so I don't think it is laced with that. Most likely an rc benzo bc the 1/4 I took hit pretty hard."
none,"I heard somewhere that said caffeine doesn't have any affect on amphetamine tolerance due to the delivery systems being completely different as caffeine is an adenosine antagonist and amphetamine is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor? Anyways I thought all stimulants had some tolerance and I know some have more than others but even if these two drugs did have tolerance, would it be noticeable at all? Say if I started drinking a cup of coffee every day for 2 weeks while taking my adderall 2 times a week would I gain tolerance to my meds faster? Or would it even be noticeable?(sorry if I'm rambling I just like to have my question thoroughly answered)"
none,I haven't did any opiates at all for a month and 2 weeks and I don't intend to do any for 2 more weeks.  I wasn't able to find a clear answer from reddit and I have only did opiates 3 times in my life within the same year but I'm a lightweight and wondering if I even have any tolerance I have noticed the first time I tried oxy was a week after I tried hydros and I didn't get as high the second time.  How will say 10 mg of oxy hit me?
none,Is there a way you can sell on Craigslist that I'm not aware about? I searched up almost all weed related slang and nothing came up. Are there any other sites where I can meet up with someone? If not is there any possible way of selling weed easily? It's just a few grams and I just want it off me I don't care how I sell it. I am not using snap chat or instagram both are a no go.  Would the possibility of just plainly going up to people and asking if they want to buy weed be to dangerous?
none,I have tried adderall and weed a few times together and a couple minutes after hitting a joint I get super spaced out.  So my first time I tried this combo I took the addy to help me have a productive day in class and the opportunity to get a little stoned came around lunchtime where I did a light puff puff and speed walked back to class so I wouldn't be late and time seemed to slow as I was walking down the hall and every step started to seem like I was walking on a trampoline or if I was a pice or rubber bouncing around every step I took.  So I got to class and noticed I felt my whole face tingly as my body started to feel heavier and I remembered I popped in my earbuds because who doesn't love listening to music on adderall it's amazing plus the stoned trippy sound it gives off made it sound like it was playing from inside my head and I remember putting my head down just straight staring at the floor and the hard stone floor we had in class had various stains which when I was looking at it seemed to be morphing and actually started to morph into faces which I thought uhh wtf this doesn't even happen to me on weed but I do have to say it was pretty fuckin awesome.  I would continue to stare at the floor and these purple webs sort of started turning like a clock and I saw 3 purple outlines of cartoonish like characters that were holding hands and dancing.  But something I noticed from my acid trips is that the longer you can stare at something the more intense the visuals become.  So I looked up at the wall and the music complimented the visuals so nicely that it was almost hypnotic I kid you not.  So what is causing this reaction? Maybe the adderall is able to bring out the psychedelic part of weed?
none,"I sink into a void of darkness every time I miss weed and lsdSorry in advance for the grammar errors.  I am a freshman about to be a sophomore in high school and I had recently felt in love with lsd and loved all the unexplainable weird things that happen on it and I had always wanted to go deeper into the trip but only had 1 tab(200 ug)but was reallyyy feeling like tripping hard that night so I searched up how to potentiate acid and ppl said to smoke a lil weed so I did I popped the tab waited about an hour and a half and I had all the weed I would need so I went outside and was just as happy as could be and smoked about half a blunt just to feel how my body would react to this combination and I was just getting these amazing visuals almost overwhelming but in a wowww I have never ever experienced this in my life type of visuals.  So all was good as soon as I go back and lay in my bed and put my earbuds in my mind starts to kind of loose it and I hear this weird buzzing sound that's almost coming from inside my head and it would go higher and lower in pitch even after I took off my earbuds to see wtf is going on then BOOM I'm full on tripping and I can't control any of my thoughts I was almost blind from the visuals and my whole span of view is covered in pixels and I'm just scared for my life at this point and I have no where to escape I close my eyes and after seconds of doing that I feel myself floating up into space and there were shadows that would rush out from the walls and I could feel my body just almost convulsing every time one them would pass through me and I remember looking down over and seeing my dog on my recliner chair staring at me with his ears back and shivering and had his tail tucked between his legs which keep in mind he was fast asleep a couple minutes ago.  A couple minutes later I see my dog start pacing back and fourth in the room and he throws up all of a sudden and when I come near him to say it's okay he acts like he doesn't want to be touched which is very weird for him.  I was at a point of giving up as I lay in the bed I would just see the room morph as the shadows grew and my body started twitching and shivering uncontrollably with my mouth hanging open just staring off with no expression and it was like I could see myself from a third person view.  I also have a desk in my room I keep for homework and all of a sudden a paper falls off and another just floats down a few seconds after but my fan isn't on and the vent wasn't blowing any air at this time.  I read a post from another guy who tried this combo and said his girlfriend said he looked possessed and couple almost feel the tension in the room which reminded me of my experience.  And yeah I get it I tripped wayyyy to hard because the weed potentiated acid way more than I expected but the way my dog was staring at me like he knew what I was seeing and threw up kind of scared me he even growled at one point but would never take his eyes off of me.  And what the hell was that buzzing sound I heard in my head and every time I would get a burst of fear that I was honestly going to lose my life, the buzzing sound would reach a higher pitch but it was almost like my body was shutting down and I had no control over it, what did I experience?  I think there's more to psychedelics than we realize. My mind has been permanently changed from these experiences."
none,So I have tried adderall a few times and I just get this glowing euphoria from it and music sounds incredible if I'm not wrong mdma is also a type of amphetamine?  Is there a different kind of euphoria you get from mdma? Is that the reason everything feels so great when touching it while on the substance? Again I know very little about it I am thinking about trying it in the future...I heard it could be life changing?
none,So I have lil to no tolerance to opiates at all and my cousin gave me a free 30 script of oxys and a few hydros thrown in. So I took 20 mg hydrocodone(4 pills)a couple days ago and felt a lil nauseated but nothing to bad.  So yesterday I decided to take 4 of the 5mg oxy pills and 1 of the 5 mg hydro. It started to kick in and I could feel myself getting extremely tired to the point of kind of nodding in and out and I get up to get water and my feet and hands are clammy and kind of cold and about a minute after standing up I feel super dizzy and had to run to the toilet because I thought I was gonna throw up but thankfully didn't and I look in the mirror and ofc my pupils are pin pricks but my face was so pale and white and I had pretty dark eye bags to and just felt like complete shit. So my questions are is there any medicine or anything I can do to prevent feeling like this in the future? And why did I feel so sick? Was it possibly the acetaminophen or what?
none,So a couple weeks ago something came up where I needed my bud out of the house ASAP bc I knew my room was gonna be searched so as a temporary hiding spot I went and got a mini shovel and dug a quick hole and dropped my weed in there(It's inside a mason jar and the mason jar is inside a plastic bag just to be safe) then covered it back up so only I would know where it was.  But now it's been underground for a few weeks now and I actually think it's a pretty decent spot for now. And I don't intend to leave it there for much longer but my question to you guys? Is this a pretty decent hiding spot for my bud?
none,"Do you guys have any personal tips, experiences or just cool pieces of trivia for some of the most popular drugs?

none,"I like the house of Dior and their fragrances and after finishing my Sauvage EDP bottle, I went to a Sephora to try out something new. I saw Dior Fahrenheit and the first sniff of it instantly made me think of a martial art expert, a really tough guy who really isn't afraid of anything or anyone. There is something suspenseful with the smell, like in a good horror movie where you know there is something about to happen. The projection and longevity is nuclear. Yes I also get a gasoline accord from it, but only in the first 15 minutes, then it dries down to the most masculine and bossy smell possible. It's ok to wear in summer nights as well, less is better with this fragrance when it's hot outside."
none,"The Walking Dead show goes as usual, but in season 1 episode 2 Rick meets John Wick and he joins his group and stays throughout the show. How long do you think John will survive?"
none,it's really potent stuff and I don't want to snort it anymore because my nose burns and bleeds lol. I've got about a gram left.
none,"After testing the original EDT in a Sephora and seeing that it literally fades away from skin in an an hour, I tried the EDP.Oh man this fragrance is literally art. It smells extremely seductive, makes your knees feel soft.  Very unique and pleasing smell. It always makes me picture a very classy handsome guy that doesn't really have to come first to women and flirt with them, it's the women who flirt with him and are all over him. Projection and longevity are very good on skin.The day I picked it up, night came and did the average routine of 5 sprays. Streets we're full of people enjoying the weekend and I had to meet up with some friends. On that walk I occasionaly looked back at people who we're passing me and they always looked back at me as well (it gave me lots of confidence and state of well being). Huuuuge compliment getter especially from females. Wear this a little dressed up and at night only, don't just throw a T-Shirt on and a pair of short pants and then spray this if you want better results.The brand created a masterpiece."
none,"I chose my signature scent Dior Sauvage EDP for example.I get occasional compliments from girls and guys but that's it. For example I once read a post on this sub about a guy wearing Tobacco Oud by Tom Ford all winter and having guys that would make fun of him before wearing it more respectful towards him when he encountered them. I very much think a fragrance can be a small hint of who you are, or fit a certain outfit, or certain situation you are in (party, for example). But no, wearing Creed Aventus won't make girls be all over you and sit on your knees. Fragrance is only an added boost on your attractiveness.Just know the basics of fragrance, that some or for the daytime and others for night and you'll be good."

none,"Today I had a shitty day. I take long baths very rarely and only showers. My bones felt like glass because of a cold and after my COVID test came up negative I figured out I should just melt in my bathtub.I lighted a fat one, entered the water and over the course of a few minutes I felt like all the negative shit, frustrations, worries we're leaking from my body in the water. Turned off the bluetooth speaker and just enjoyed the silence, the peace. Only positive thinking and euphoria. And actually realised how tripping alone is so much better. The high from weed which makes you feel at peace is bestly enjoyed alone in my opinion. Yes it's nice to laugh with a friend or two when stoned but a sudden desire to masturbate for example can't be satisfied right then and there you know. Also went in such a deep rabbit hole with my thoughts, it was really cool."
none,"I'm a teenager and in my area not many people wear fragrances. I own both and very much enjoy both equally but I'm leaning a little bit towards Sauvage because it has a darker, more masculine scent profile. It's a night party with 30 people. Can you give me some advice please?"
none,"Projection and longevity on this one are reaaally good. It's my signature scent. Lots and lots of compliments, in my area it's not really worn. Smells like a fuck boy and I love it. Also extremely versatile."
none,"I would picture a rich italian guy , dressed up outside of a nightclub entrance smoking a cigarette flirting with a girl for some reason. It just smells so unique, despite the hate I see it gets on the internet it got me many compliments especially from females. Even a friend of mine who owns a small collection of fragrances (and tries to make his collection larger) asked me what fragrance I'm wearing, because it smells so cool. A masterpiece in my opinion that probably would have been sold at a much higher price if Gianni Versace was still alive, just an assumption of mine."
none,"Due to obvious reasons I will skip details regarding how many we we're and names. So I called a friend a while ago asking him to pick me up. I was drunk leaving a party an had an upset stomach and wanted to go home. Couldn't afford a taxi because of the distance.The idiot apparently had a pouch of MDMA pills in the glovebox and the interior reeked of weed. You know, when you have drugs in your car you better always use turn signals and respect traffic laws, but he was driving a bit reckless. On a road a cop car turned it's siren and started chasing us. I instantly sobered up from my drunkness. The police chased us for a minute and two at which we we're going over 150km/h and gained speed. My friend drifted between some buildings that had narrow roads in a zig zag layout. Then there was the fastest and smoothest side parking I ever saw lol. He turned off the lights and 10 seconds later the police pulls in and goes forward about 50 meters and turns right searching for us. They didn't saw shit. My friend tossed out the drugs in some bushes. I climbed out and walked back home on foot and the next day when I met him again he said no one chased him again and got home all safe. As an advice, know the people around you well, I could have gotten in some big trouble if they pulled us over."
none,"It's relatively cheap, depends where you live and how you obtain it.Makes you feel good, powerful euphoria and laughing. Fits in almost any social situation like a party or a small group gathering, hanging out with your gf or boyfriend and the list goes on.And the most important thing of all: it's the safest. You literally can't overdose on it.Just knowing this makes the experience 100 times better, when I would take MDMA , sometimes I'd be a bit nervous, thinking of things like, what if I overdose and die, what if it kicks in too hard and make a fool myself etc. Had some experiences when I would take only half of a Tesla tab and my jaw almost dislocated. Very potent shit. This was just an example.Weed has a bit of everything. The swiss army knife of drugs."
none,"I own the EDP version, it's got nuclear projection and longevity as many of you know. What I want to say is, the smell, it's so erotic and seductive. Would picture an attractive, extroverted guy wearing this, with a slightly mysterious vibe. And here comes the versatility problem. Yes no one stops you to wear it as a signature scent, but you would definitely lose that special vibe you want to have at a party, or night out. It's a compliment monster, and it always gives me looks from girls.Another thing to mention, I advise you people to steer away from the EDT version, it's not what it used to be anymore, longevity and projection are weak now due to reformulations. The EDP smells the same and it's got nuclear performance and projection. Buy the EDP."
none,"*Please, PLEASE stay away from this shit at all costs.If you are that broke and you really want to get wasted, buy some cheap booze and get drunk,you are better off with alcohol than this poison.*We we're in his car, talking and bullshitting around,he started rolling up a joint with syntethic weed (this time without tobacco), I didn't say anything about it, I knew he's a regular and long time user.,,Let's go grab something to eat"" I say.We climb out, and we had to pass through a big park in order to get to the store.Halfway through our walk, he lights up his doobie, inhales a couple times and 20 seconds later he starts losing his balance and stumbles around. Forgot to mention I was sober.I put his arm around my neck and I basically dragged him to some bushes so he can vomit, there we're plenty of people in the park. He was severely slurring his speech and couldn't stand on his own when I leaned him against a fence.He starts to vomit a lot for the next minute  while sitting on the ground on his ass, he was also totally unresponsive when I talked to him. After that he turned unconcious, not only that but he also started violently convulsing with eyes rolled over, pale skin and tongue out.Before I called an ambulance, I checked his pockets and dumped all his drugs and anything drug related in a drain (they are illegal in my country and you can face prison for possesion). I was panicking and a small crowd formed around us right after I talked to the dispatcher. Pretended that I didn't know him to both the dispatcher and the people asking what's wrong with him.Luckily the ambulance came fast and after that I left, shocked. They took him to a hospital. He's not dead luckily but was on the brink of it. No permanent damage and he's quitting spice, I hope."
none,"So one night me and my best friend took a wrong bus after we got half an ounce of some really potent dank weed. We ended up in the fucking outskirts of the city and we had two choices, we take a cab and pay with the last of our money,or hit the road on foot to a different bus station that would take us at least 30 minutes to get to.We chosed the second option because of the munchies. As we walked we came across a very old jewish cemetery, no security guard or cameras, it looked abandoned. My friend was eager to hop the fence and have a look around and I followed him. There we're tombstones as old as 100+ years so it felt like at a museum.We got to some sort of clearing with trees, stone benches and a mausoleum , and we we're like fuck it, let's roll one up here.As we talked,laughed, got high and shared stories sitting there,mind you it was one particular cool late spring night, and from a distance of about 20 meters there was this big, detailed angel statue. The moon was bright on the sky and that freaking statue was creeping me out but I didn't said anything immediately. We we're very high and after a few minutes I just zoned out from my friend who wasn't creeped out at all, he was saying some stoner thoughts. I was thinking only about ghosts and horror, obscure shit and had an overral feeling of dread, with my peripheral vision it looked like the angel statue turned its head in our direction. It was the weed and poor light obviously. So eventually I got up, grabbed his arm, told him we are leaving and walked fast towards the fence.AND GUESS WHAT. My friend didn't ask why are we leaving so fast and why. He went mute,picked on my pace and 10 seconds later we started running. I felt shortness of breath because of fear. Only after we got out he asked ,,It was that statue, am I right?"".  Fuck yeah, it was that. Poor dude felt spooked by it too but tried to maintain a fun vibe, it didn't work.Anyways as a side note,we returned to that place a few weeks later during the day and it's actually kinda peaceful, we we're sober as well, that means a lot obviously."
none,"I'm in fucking love with this fragrance. It smells so classy, unique and dreamy, like it's name. Definitely wear this at night. It gives me a very luxurious,succesful vibe.Solid projection and longevity as well. One more thing to add,I wore it one night at a house party, it was mostly outdoors in the host's backyard and tried being aware of people around me. Catched some girls staring at me and received a good amount of compliments from them. A friend of mine said I smell like space and like I just came from the moon, I don't know if this is a good or bad thing haha."
none,"I've got a few sweet, flirty fragrances and I'm looking for something very masculine with strong projection. I never smelled this before, my nose isn't pretentious with fragrances though."
none,"So I own these 2 fragrances, I love them both equally, both project strongly, both last a really long time.I'm in a dilema here and I'd want to hear out your opinions."
none,"We've all been there. Drinking too much at that house party and either making a fool of yourself in front of people, calling your ex or passing out in the most random locations possible.I remember one winter night I was at a birthday party and it was like -14°C outside and the wind blowing hard. In a drunken challenge me and several other boys jumped in the snow naked at 2 in the morning and spent there a solid 5 minutes before we went back inside. How to warm up faster? LETS HAVE SOME CAPTAIN MORGAN.An hour and a half later I was so drunk I was basically asleep with my eyes open and could barely stand on my own. The whole room was spinning with me very fast and in a last moment of self control I put my coat on and went on the front porch to puke out. After vomiting for God knows how long, I thought out I better sit on a chair and breathe some fresh air, because people we're smoking inside. And there I passed out with my head and hands resting on the table in that extremely cold night for you know how long? FUCKING 4 HOURS. What woke me up was the alarm on my phone that I had set up for work and forgot to turn off. Friday night. Apparently people tried to carry me inside, but being blacked out I don't remember that, but from what I heard I was basically clenched to that table and refused by any means to go back inside, mumbling incoherent shit. So being also shitfaced they gave up and just plugged in a portable heater next to me and put a bunch of thick blankets on me. Honestly not even syntethic weed (spice) didn't had such a powerful effect to me when I tried it. Alcohol can be one of the strangest drugs sometimes and I'm glad I didn't get hypothermia that night."
none,We achieved literally everything we have as a species now using mathematics and I'm actually curious if an individual can predict his/her own future using mathematic ecuations and stuff like that. For example which job I will work when I'm 40.
none,"Back in the day when I smoked weed heavily I could limit myself to be sober when working at a job. I would always be the typical stoner, when high I would laugh, eat, chill and talk. But would never be capable to engage in complex tasks. I worked an entire summer as a waiter in a restaurant, so far so good until I got one of my friends hired there. Waiter as well. When we had no clients and our boss was not at the restaurant , he would insist to smoke a joint with him in the bathroom, I refused the first few times as I wanted to maintain a sharp mind in case the tables got crowded with clients. This guy would be totally functional when high, he could handle by himself 10+  tables with complicated orders. Used eye drops  chewing gum, fragrance, to appear sober. I remember one rainy morning when absolutely no one was showing up I agreed to get high with him as the atmosphere was boring. 15 minutes later the rain stopped and nearly an hour later the place got crowded. And I was HIGH AS FUCK. Got huge anxiety interacting with people and I would mistake orders with others, nearly spilled a drink on a lady's clothes etc. People started getting iritated because of me, but my friend on the other hand had no problems and fixed whatever he could for me. The bartender, a cool girl, saw that something was strange with me and suggested that I call in sick that day, as the boss was not with us that day and so I did. The boss was slightly upset with that but finally said ok, stay home.From then on I remained sober at work. And now I see that it's popular and normalized to be a functional stoner, wtf. Why can't you just smoke in your free time and actually enjoy the high?"
none,"This was a blind buy. And the best one so far.I'm a actually very surprised that for an Eau de Toillete it's got such a strong projection and long longevity.Its very good for a date, club, party situation. Or if you want to make a statement.I don't find it powdery or syntethic at all, in fact I think it's a masterpiece."
none,"I wear it as a signature scent for the daytime, it got me some compliments but not a lot of them.I see it's long lasting but not loud regarding the projection. Great bang for the buck as well, would be ok for all seasons all occasions, but I prefer Eros when I want to make a statement."
none,"Regarding the title I stopped smoking weed and railing lines of speed at parties a while ago. I'm a young guy and I started with weed very early (at 13), then alcohol, then MDMA as I grew up older and the list goes on.I often didn't had to hit on girls, as they would flirt with me first most times, everything went well and I would be very close to be in a relationship with them, but when they directly or indirectly found out I smoke weed on an almost daily basis, or get shitfaced at parties and make a fool of myself sometimes, they would slowly start to ghost me. I wasn't even bragging about it or anything, I didn't stole, in fact I had, and still have a large amount of friends that I get along with very well and I try to make good impressions when meeting someone new. However dumb me thought that doing drugs and drinking industrial amounts of alcohol was OK and that people don't have boundaries. Big mistake.Because of the frustrations and sadness I felt regarding my trouble getting an actual girlfriend and not one-night hook ups I seeked refuge in drugs a lot more and that's when I came across acid for the first time.Now I can say for sure that drugs made me quit drugs... In my first trip it was just me and my best friend in a park. We both took a way larger dose than we should've had and all of our problems started to make sense. In my case it was this problem with girls that started making sense to me, the feelings of revelation, peace and the super complex thoughts hit me like a train.Finally I figured out it was my fault all this time, and why it was my fault. Needless to say the next day I cut off contact with all my plugs, and started hanging out with people that chosed sobriety and would only limit themselves to alcohol at parties. And quited drugs as well. My life took a total opposite direction, towards the better, and I see that the use of drugs is so glamorized these days. Especially weed. I fucking enjoyed it as well but its not a thing for the future. I still haven't found a gf though but it doesn't really matter as now I'm working on enjoying my life as it is now, and that should matter the most always.To end this, I have to say that there is no right thing between being sober and not being sober. These are just choices we make. But dont be surprised if some people will look at you differently."
none,"Eu și prietenii mei ne-am plimbat cu trenul spre mai multe orașe din țară (suntem din București). Până acum am vizitat Ploiești, Iași, Craiova, Brașov, Constanța. Am vrut sa facem poze dar să și călătorim.La Galați am văzut că e acel turn de televiziune cu restaurant în vârf, pare interesant. La fel și faleza e frumoasă. Poimâine avem plecarea spre Galați, e ceva de orașul ăsta?"
none,"So I went to lots of house parties in which I did plenty of drugs, like weed, speed, MDMA and alcohol. I thought I can't have fun without at least getting really drunk but to my surprise I actually did.So yesterday a very long train ride from the other side of my country made me very tired and lethargic. Today a good friend of mine threw a party at his apartment and invited me as well. Being still tired mentally from yesterday I decided fuck it, I will remain sober, see how it goes and if I can't enjoy it then I'm going home.My friends we're drinking, passing joints around, kindly refused all of their offers and sticked to glasses of juice in my hand.I danced a lot, laughed and chatted completely sober and let me tell you it felt good being in control of myself by 100%. No more stumbling around, my face didn't resembled a ghost anymore, and more importantly a very healthy choice for me and my mind.I felt nice and helpful to help people out sort out things because they we're under the influence. Anyways I ended up staying until everyone started leaving, by that I mean about 7-8 hours. When I was heading home from a party on MDMA or speed I felt like shit. This time I had peace of mind and slept properly. So if you are not addicted (I'm not) try to party sober at least once and see how it goes. It can change the way you see some things for the better."
none,"I started smoking cigarettes 4 years ago, and I can't go for a single day without having at least 3 or 4 cigarettes.I don't want to switch to vaping, I just want to quit this shitty habit for good. I'm done stinking constantly, and bothering non smoking people around me.Cravings are a bitch, haven't smoked since yesterday and I'm trying to keep myself busy constantly to avoid triggers."
none,"A few decades ago, yes it actually was a symbol of wealth and it also served the purpose of knowing the time, and still does obviously. I have seen multiple people wearing expensive analog watches, and when you go up to them and ask them what time is it, they pull out their phones from their pocket to look. I'm strictly referring to really expensive watches, not average ones. Why would you buy something like this, when nowadays literally almost everyone has a phone with a clock feature in it. Smartwatches though are actually ok and useful. And would be a way better alternative if you are more old school and preffer to check the time by looking at your wrist."
none,"Look so I'm pretty new in fragrances, and I only own 3 (Versace The Dreamer, Versace Blue Jeans, Giorgio Armani Lui).A friend is throwing a house party for his birthday and there is this girl that I overheard she likes me.Because we're partying at night I find the scent of The Dreamer more appropiate for the vibe, you know.What fragrance out of these 3 should I wear?"
none,"So a few days ago my friend threw a small party at his apartment. He bought a very loud sound system and he wanted to test it out.We we're 11 boys and girls, and one of the 2 guys that I snorted speed with, started selling and had like 10 grams to which he decided fuck it, I'm gonna use all of it at this party.So I ended up having 3 days of no sleep, it was some potent shit so I'm surprised I didn't had a heart attack. It was all for free, I only spent money on relatively inexpensive things like cigarettes, beers and chewing gum.The first night was fucking lit, I didn't drank any alcohol so good on me, I remember I went out in the balcony to smoke a cigarette and there we're 2 girls and a dude passing a fat blunt and laughing hard as fuck.They offered me some, smoked, and in that moment my body just exploded with euphoria and energy. I couldn't stay still for even 3 seconds I think.And they kindly refused my meth offer, they sticked to weed and booze only, good for them. After that I only remember pieces of what happened, I know everything looked trippy and blurry, bass from tech-house was pounding my chest and I danced like a maniac with the kitchen plate in my hand, doing a line every 5 minutes. Someone got concerned that I would overdose and conviced me to take a break, didn't protest anything. The second and the third night we're more laid back, we we're focused more on discussions and playing on the console since we we're just 4 in total. The comedown would've been absolutely the shittiest one a human being can have if I didn't had weed on hand, got well past it, slept, eat and drank water well. So obviously this is not something I'm doing again, like ever. No big cravings though."
none,"I blind buyed this one and oh boy it's so amazing. The smell is so dark and masculine and a crowd pleaser. So yesterday I had a good occasion to wear this fragrance, me and my friends booked a few tables at some coffee house, plenty of girls we're there (mutual friends thing). I started talking to a girl and she was leaning closer pretty often even though we could hear each other well. Got some compliments on how I smell. In my opinion this and Versace The Dreamer are the best tobacco fragrances out there."
none,"My friend told me this. I usually put my coke/meth on a ceramic plate and start snorting off it.He told me that it's better to lay the powder on a mirror because all those particles remain there unlike on ceramic.Also, that I better use a razor blade or metal card to form my lines. Is it true?"
none,Talking about an average line and average quality. I bought a gram to snort by myself on New Year's Eve and I hope it will last me until 5AM. Any thoughts?
none,"For example I was at a party a few days ago, and me and a friend snorted a gram of some really fire speed. Also drank a fair bit of alcohol. Nothing bad except the fact that my jaw was clenching so hard I chewed an entire pack of Orbit gum, constantly bit the inside of my cheeks and my jaw still feels sore now. I have the same problem on MDMA as well."
none,I watched an interview with a killer in my country with like 6 murders and in his last murder he was with an accomplice and they beaten a man for like 2 hours and a half and the victim was still alive until the killer began to stab him like 100 times everywhere on his body.
none,"I recently got the contact of a weed guy, so far so good.I texted him and he told me to wait in front of some sketchy park in my city. It was 1AM, I was all by myself when some another guy showed up and sat beside me on a bench. About half an hour passed and I was getting frustrated since the plug said he'll be there in no more than 10 minutes. He wasn't answering.The other guy was frantically calling and texting as well and both of us kinda understood what was happening. We started some small talk and at some point he asked me if ,,i'm waiting for someone"". I said I called an Uber.Seeing he was starting to roll up a filter tip I bursted out laughing, the dude looked at me then started to laugh as well. We both received the same text at the same time, saying that he's only a couple streets away coming with his car.At this point I asked the guy on the bench if X has fire shit, if he usually comes in time etc.Turned out he was an old client of his and assured me that the plug has potent weed and usually arrives on time on meetings, that this is a rare occurance etc. He was right and I got 5 grams of some fire purple haze, guy on the bench asked me if I wanna smoke a fat one with him but I was in a hurry since I had a bunch of friends waiting for me at my apartment to smoke, so I kindly refused. Next afternoon I called my plug again and this time he even showed up a bit before me haha."
none,"So here I am visiting my grandma at the countryside.Behind her house is a garden with a big ranch next to it and I thought it would be a good spot to spark a joint at night before sleep. I grabbed my stuff and went there, did my business but the weed kicked in hard and felt too lazy to go back in bed, so I hanged there for a little longer.As I was listening to music and scrolling through social media some noise caught my attention. About 30 meters away a pair of glowing eyes was staring right at me without moving an inch. I nearly shat my pants, I freezed in place and a thousand thoughts started flowing in my mind at once. A few minutes passed and me and the creature didn't moved our glances on each other.A video call on my friends group chat woke me up from that fear induced trance, and I tried to leave the other way around but it was a dead end. I have no idea how I worked up the courage to run past the animal, but as I ran the motion activated light from the front porch activated and I could see a glimpse of what was staring at me. A brown horse chewing on grass who probably got attracted by the weed smell I guess. Laughed a bit, grabbed an apple from the fridge, fed it with it and gave it some pets and left. Weed is hella of a drug sometimes lol."
none,"I usually get really high when I smoke weed (it's a weekend thing for me). Except for using eye drops or wearing sunglasses when around people, these are things I already do but I feel like my behaviour screams that I'm high."
none,"Growing up as a teenager I experienced plenty of bad things that haunted me for years and consumed my soul literally. Never went to therapy and I'm grateful I didn't needed too. In the last two years I made a decent amount of friends, worked on my social skills and left behind my previous toxic group of friends. What I didn't accomplished yet is finding a girlfriend (I'm 17) but I'm trying to be optimistic about it. Got a fair amount of compliments from girls about my blue eyes, idk. Focusing on losing some weight right now. This life is so much better when you have a goal that you actively chase on."
none,"Especially psychedelics such as acid,shrooms or weed. That would be an absolutely mind blowing experience for anyone, seeing planet Earth on the window, all the complex and sophisticated thoughts you would have in that 0 gravity environment."
none,"Rarely the government has their own food producing chains. Almost all of the food you eat comes from farmers who sell their products to markets, etc.They grow crops, used to feed cattle and other farm animals, which in turn are eaten by us.Most young people want a degree in physics, medicine and other valuable professions but very few want to work on ranches, and see that as gross, unpopular, uncomfortable etc. Without farmers we would starve to death, or have limited options in buying food than now at least. These are the people who have a high contribution in your breakfast's presence. They should receive credit as well because of their hard labor and skills."
none,"It's an occasional drug for me, only done in social settings btw. When the high kicks in I lose control over how much I snort, especially after my nose goes numb. Luckily my friends will see that and help me stop,sometimes with a bit of arguing but whatever. I would be like high as a kite talking nearly as fast as Eminem and blinking only once every half a minute, but still wanting to get as fucked up as humanly possible, due to how pleasurable the high feels. My heart would be racing dangerously fast but I still won't stop.What can I do about that? Probably coke isn't a drug that suits me."
none,I use a hydra and two Molot T's.
none,"I kinda feel like a highschool teacher lol. He smokes weed on a regular basis but always with other friends, so he never felt the necessity of learning the art of rolling, I guess. Today he came over at my place to smoke, and when I had to take a shit and asked him to roll one for me, and he said he doesn't know how, a switch flicked in my brain. I made my commitment to teach this dude once and for all how to roll and I did.He was so proud of himself and ended up smoking joints rolled by him all day. For a starter he actually rolls nice ones with good burn, even faster when high haha 😂.Sorry for this post being kinda uninteresting, but I'm feeling pretty wholesome about this."
none,"I live in a 4 stories apartament building, with nearly 10 steps on each stair. I run on them from the ground floor to the 4th floor 15 times a day, 15 times of climbing to be specific. Already changed my diet into a healthier one. Is it a good training?"
none,"Ever since I started smoking weed (4 years now) I have seen a gradual, but sure increase in my wisdom for real. It opened some parts in my brain and thinking. It didn't really have a negative impact on me except occasional short therm memory problems, especially one time when I had an almost two weeks of being high everyday, was only sober when I woke up in the morning in my bed lol.Have you guys achieved this too?"
none,"Common place, I know, but it was my first time getting high in a forest.Yesterday I texted my girlfriend if she wanna smoke with me, and she came over at my place.While she was on her way to me, this great idea came to me that we should go to the forest next to my city, rather than be in the lame setting of my apartment. She found my idea awesome, so we hop in my car and go there. Of course stopped by at some random store to buy food for the munchies 😅.It was nearly midnight when we arrived and the vibe was so nice. Cricket sounds, the wind softly blowing through tree branches, very beautiful. We sat on a log and I rolled up 5 big joints, played some music from my car to match the vibe, etc. We both got very high and kissed and cuddled all night, she is very attractive and the moon light spilled over our area made me feel like I'm with an angel. We talked about life and very deep topics about ourselves, our weaknesses, everything. She told me how special she finds me on every plan, it was the deepest and most honest conversation I had with someone in my life.It's so amazing to be high in a deep forest, not only because of the cool and peaceful setting, but I felt like I had so much freedom.We could talk loud and do whatever we wanted without attracting attention to anyone, stumble around and laugh, etc. Smoked the last one when the sun was rising, had some great sex in the back seat and then both fell asleep. Can't wait to go on a camping trip here next time and get high haha 😂."
none,"No, I'm not sad before I get high, feeling uneasy or any other shit related to sadness.I would smoke weed when feeling depressed before, and it made me happy, euphoric and a lot better lol.But now? I have no clue why. I'm not a heavy weed smoker, I get high once every 2 or 3 days, I actually set up a personal schedule for my weed consumption during the quarantine 😅. Now when I smoke I start to really overthink, cry a lot, and think about negative aspects of my life (there are a lot of them actually, not exagerating) I just curl up in a ball in my bed, start binge smoking like a pack of cigarettes in two hours and feel like shit, mentally. I changed multiple strains of weed, all of them have this result on me except indica strains who make me sleepy and I'm not really observing the high when on it for much longer because I melt into my bed and sleep like a dead man. Any explanation for this? Thank you."
none,"I'm not a heavy smoker, I finish a pack in 2, sometimes 3 days when sober.But everytime I get drunk I swear to God I crave cigarettes so much and smoking them feels more enjoyable than sober.I don't know why, could someone explain to me why? It happens to me every single time. I can smoke like 1 pack in maybe 4 or 5 hours max."
none,"Or for a while until I get past this horrible experience of yesterday. I was home alone and ate two firecrackers with 1 gram each in them. Dumb me lost track of time while playing video games and forgot that I ate the first edible like an hour ago and I still wasn't feeling shit, I thought it passed like 2 hours since eating the first one on an empty stomach.So I head to the kitchen to eat the other one, go back to my room and 10 minutes later my heart starts racing a bit.Was feeling good but a short while after I start peaking and the high was getting very overwhelming.I'm very experienced in smoking weed and I don't feel anxious anymore when I smoke large quantities but I'm a newbie to the edibles.I lay on my bed to calm down a bit but to no effect. Was glued to my bed for a good chunk of time thinking I was about to die. I was very very panicked, sweating a lot and my heart felt like it was about to jump out from my chest. Couldn't even sleep it off, when I was laying down on my stomach combined with my heart beating hard and fast, it physically felt uncomfortable.After a few hours I crawled to my kitchen to drink some water and damn I never drank so much water, my throat felt like I swallowed sand. After chugging some water I felt a bit better but this time very tired.Got back to my room, closed the curtains and slept for a long time.This high wasn't enjoyable at all, was trying hard Not to panick and call 911. My mind was going 1000 mph. Had some pretty nasty visuals too, I felt like I was watched and saw things in the corner of my eyes that obviously weren't there. Very laggy vision.Yep, I will switch to just smoking it for a while. At least next time I do edibles would certainly be better if I have a good friend with me."
none,"Don't kill me for that, there was literally no other soul outside in my city at like 1AM except military and police. And I worn a medical mask.So last night I ran out of weed (quarantine is so boring) texted my regular dealer if he could give me some but he wasn't answering, he lives very close to me also.Texted another guy who lives far away from me in my city, he said sure but he wasn't coming outside to risk a huge fine and get busted with weed on him.I said fuck it, I'm going myself at his place. Got dressed in all black and went out. Couldn't afford a taxi since he lives pretty far away and decided to walk,and they often get pulled over too.Had to avoid like all the main streets who we're swarming of police and the army patrolling, took walks only through apartment blocks and parking lots. At some point I had to hide under a car to avoid a close police car slowly cruising in my vicinity 😂.The whole ordeal felt like I was an escaped convict from prison honestly. The city felt so eerie so late at night, only thing I was hearing was my fast walking and occasional police sirens.Finally arrived at the guy's house, got 9 grams from him, payed and quickly left. When I got home it was close to sunrise (after a while I chilled out and took a longer road to my home to enjoy the scenery) and got to enjoy smoking one when the sun was rising and the birds we're chirping. Very beautiful. Next time I will be more cautious and keep track of my stash 😂 I won't forget the paranoia."
none,"Alright, so I don't have an oven to which you can regulate the temperature of baking food, just an old one and a pretty new microwave. Saw a tutorial on the internet, in which you just need hazelnut spread,graham crackers, tinfoil and the weed for the ingredients (talking about the firecrackers). Will it for for real? You need to spread like half a gram on each cracker, they said. I can obviously trace the time of baking but can't regulate the temperature, just the oven flame, bigger or smaller. Does it work using a microwave? Anyone did this recipe?"
none,"I live in a 3 rooms apartment (only me and my parents) and with this lockdown I can't really stay outdoors and get high like before. Luckily my dealer lives close to me though 😅.How can I get rid of the smell? Last night I sparked a small joint after my parents fell asleep, and this morning they complained about some smell in my room (they don't know anything about how weed smells luckily, and don't know that I smoke). Also kept the window fully opened for like 3 hours that night. Besides the smell any tips for staying safe would be very useful."
none,"For me it's the perfect match for the set I'm in when getting crossfaded. Big house party with chest hitting bass and lots of girls to hook up with? I get very friendly, social lubricated and horny. I dance like an animal and feel lit, and making out with someone feels so blissfull and pleasurable. Chill setting we're it's just me and 3 or 4 other friends? Conversations get really deep and funny, I be like dying of laughter and melting on the couch. Alcohol can make your weed high much more intense on the right amount of drinking and how much food you ate before. I always smoke first, eat pizza or something and then drink alcohol, as many people know that sparking a joint when already drunk can give you the spins and make you feel sick. I never drinked then smoked but I knew this since my first time getting crossfaded so sticked to it. I advice you to do it as well."
none,"For real I have friends that get shit-faced drunk at parties and are heavy tobacco smokers but when you offer them to hit your joint a couple of times they chicken out and you barely make them take one hit from it. So you are not afraid to risk dying of alcohol poisoning and wake up with a killer hang over the next day but you afraid of some fucking weed, that has a harmless effect that passes in like 3 hours? Not gonna lie I was nervous too the first time I got stoned, but I changed my mind pretty quickly because I only have 1 life, just 1, if I'm not gonna like it I would never smoke again. Only time I was truly worried as fuck was the first time I took MDMA but in the end it was literally the best experience in my life so far."
none,It was usually related to rap music and in it there was a hand holding a pen writing lyrics and the wrist unfolded like a revolver's barrel and the other hand was loading bullets in it. Thanks!
none,"Never smoked it but I'm curious about how it feels like. I've heard that it's an extremely strong psychedelic drug but can you actually get a good, pleasurable high from it? One where I don't feel uneasy or worse start panicking."
none,"I have 2 grams and I am saving it for a party. I keep it wrapped in tinfoil, in a ziplock baggie and an empty kinder surprise egg at the same time, will it get dry or worse catch mold? I keep it in a dry environment also, so I hope there won't be any problems."
none,"I have about a gram in a ziplock baggie, kept in an empty kinder surprise egg. I have this stash for a week now (in my drawer), will it last another week? I check it from time to time and it seems fine, no weird smells, no signs of mold I guess. It's quality bud, not some random shitty weed. Will it be okay?"
none,Like for real for some reason it instantly makes me horny. I don't know why but I love it.
none,"By this I want to know if this combination is actually dangerous in such environment. Of course I will spending some time outside too (smoker), but I tend to completely, and I mean COMPLETELY lose all my inhibitions when I get high and drunk at the same time. If I had a sober friend in my squad I wouldn't have wrote this, but since I'm stuck in this loop, I am asking: Should I stay hydrated? Is it a good idea to get so shitfaced in the first place? Of course talking from an medical point of view, since alcohol raises body temperature (I don't really care about how shitfaced I'm gonna be though, of course 😂)."
none,"I mean from an average point of view. When I turn 18 I would like to go to America for work and probably settle there permanently. I'm from Europe. Any opinion, good or bad, is welcomed. Thanks."
none,"Just had my cousin peeing all over the bedroom wall exactly in the same spot where I kept my backpack full of clothes. Talking about people who know how they are acting when drunk and still don't make any attempt to contain their alcohol intake. I know what it's like to be shit-face drunk but seriously is walking to the bathroom that hard? It's disgusting. Also I just placed a fucking bucket in the room before this, for him to puke into just in case, but what the fuck man. Please be careful about who you drink with. My phone charger is also soaked because of him. Fucking lightweight."
none,"I know the sacred rule of smoking first and then drinking but I would like to hear some experiences. (I hope this doesn't get buried in the ,,New section"" of commentaries)"
none,"Especially after eating baked eggs it makes it smell even more strongly. I hate other people's farts though (obviously), but whenever I'm laying in my bed with my blanket on and fart, I love getting my head under the blanket and inhale that stink. It doesn't make me gag at all but as I said it's totally different when someone else near me farts."
none,"Not really an everyday user (about once per 2 weeks at the worst) but I've noticed some changes in my mood lately. When I'm out with my friends and someone teases me or jokes about me in a pretty offensive manner I would literally boil. Or if I make plans with a friend and he cancels them to hang out with someone else, again I have a really hard time trying not to ruin my relationship with everyone. I KNOW for sure this didn't happened before, until now when I started smoking more and more frequently. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. Didn't smoked any laced stuff just some really potent shit if that matters. Noticed some odd thing with my mood in general too, even if I'm in my room all alone doing absolutely nothing. My mood is shifting from happy and outgoing to very depressed and anxious and thinking only about how shitty and boring my life is. At really random times. No I won't see a psychiatrist yet however if it's a must, I'll first talk to someone I trust and see how I'm feeling over a term of 1 week or so of not smoking. Anyone else experienced these issues with weed? It doesn't feel like a hangover at all in any way, or something similar to it (just saying in case weed comedowns exist lol)."
none,"I've heard multiple opinions that you should always smoke first and only then drink alcohol, that if you do the opposite it will make you puke and feel really bad etc. I only got drunk and high at the same time 3 times and each time it felt waaay better than a normal weed trip, it made the effects of weed like 10 times stronger than normal. Should people avoid drinking first and then smoking? Why? (btw I smoked first then drank)"
none,"It made me fucking puke and realise how much of a better alternative are e-cigarettes. Btw I vape liquids with 12 mg of nicotine, and I used to smoke Marlboro Reds (pretty strong cigarettes). God bless the person who invented the electronic cigarettes."
none,"This edition Armin Van Buuren mixed for like 8 hours and I got to watch the livestream on YouTube from the festival and it was fucking dope. Talking about the main stage from the Cluj-Napoca stadium,because that's where I want to go. It seemed pretty overcrowded though and I  would like to hear some experiences from there. Honestly I don't want to imagine the trip to the bathroom, especially after getting drunk, having to push people away in that huge ass crowd. Also the hotels in that city can hold up so many people? Or do I need to reserve a room from waaay before next year? Thanks."
none,"despite the whole ,,look at the pill'' thing, I know the basics, i'm not retarded, oh and test kits aren't available in my country unfortunately so don't bring them up. Just looking for any tips on how to spot and stay away from any potential rip off since I'm a newbie regarding MDMA. My weed dealer isn't selling anything besides cannabis and doesn't know anyone who may be selling. For now all I have is my former shitty group of friends who are basically abusing it, still on decent terms with them and may reach out to them to hook me up with someone. I don't 100% trust them or the guy they would hook me up with so any good tips on how to spot a potential dumbfuck trying to rip me off would help me a lot. Thanks."
none,"Last night I invited my friend at my place, I had no cigarettes left/money to buy some and he left his pack on the kitchen table. I asked him if I can take one, he said yeah no problem and I took an extra one to smoke, for after he left. It really makes me feel bad honestly. Don't judge me I didn't wanted any nicotine withdrawal symptoms later, it makes me really cranky."
none,"I am not overweight or obese but my tummy is pretty big. I would've went to bike riding in my city, it worked for me 3 years ago and I lost a lot of weight by it. Now I don't have a bicycle anymore and tried jogging, I don't like it and besides that I get tired quickly due to me being a smoker, the coincidence lol. However I enjoy going on walks and I wouldn't mind at all making 10,000 steps a day, even more probably. Is it an effective weight loss method? (Will also try to reduce the amount of sugar I'm eating)"
none,"I honestly loved that movie, and looks like the producers of the Saw movies participated in making it. I would recommend you guys to watch it especially if you like serial killers type horror movies. I hope this post doesn't get lost down below."
none,"https://m.adevarul.ro/locale/slatina/cine-barbatul-suspectat-rapit-ucis-chinuri-groaznice-doua-adolescente-Isi-luase-duba-ocupa-targurile-1_5d3ac0d6892c0bb0c6dc80eb/index.htmlThe translation goes like this : A 15 years old girl was kidnapped by a 65 years old retired car mechanic while hitchiking, held captive at his home for several days while raped, beaten and tortured. The child managed to find an old phone in the serial killer's house to which she called 112 (the european version of 911) no longer than 3 times. In total she talked to the police on the phone for 20 minutes, struggling to let them know her location, she eventually found a business card but the name and data on it belonged to someone else,totally unrelated to this. Eventually the police arrived at the property's front gate, but COULDN'T ENTER for 3 hours because the judge didn't want to release a search mandate on the killer's property. The officers heard multiple screams and cries for help coming from inside the house, and basically begged for their superiors to let them in. Still they're requests we're declined and we're forced to return 19 hours later after they left,at night when the law gives permission for the police to bust that place. The police discovered the girl's clothes and belongings, and no other than some belongings of other missing girls from that area too. The serial killer confessed to raping,kidnapping and  killing 6 teenage girls,all 6 apparently we're hitchiking too. He cut off their body parts and dissolved them in acids and chemicals found in car batteries, and with the remaining parts he would either burn them in his yard or would bury them.The girl who called the police, was tortured and murdered with officers who could rescue her stationed RIGHT IN FRONT OF THAT PIECE OF FILTH'S GATE, even hearing her screams and her begging him not to kill her. The police now found numerous bone fragments buried in his yard, presumably human, and are now investigating the whole ordeal. Hundreds of people came to that shit's house and protested about how she could have been saved, numerous journalists and televisions are presenting this case and the public opinion is basically filled with extreme rage about how incompetent the police is in this country. I just wanted to point that out, American citizens of Reddit. Be glad that your cops are so well trained and prepared, and that they are allowed to shoot and kill in these situations, and are able to ram in the houses of kidnappers, abusive husbands etc much easily. And that they are allowed to kill these trashes if they make a move. Because there are still countries, in the 21st century, so corrupt and poor like mine. I don't love my country. There are dozens of other similar things that happened here due to this corrupt government. Cop being stabbed to death at night for no reason by a crazy redneck in a train station, had no gun to protect himself only a can of pepper spray that he couldn't even pull out from his utility belt... Officers don't have bulletproof vests at all, again cop shot and killed in the chest in mission... This year there was a public report on 10 million romanians migrating to other european countries in the course of a few years, almost all never to return."
none,"My phone is a Huawei P9 Lite 2017 with 16GB internal memory, and I have an SD Card with another 16 GB of memory as well. However when I switch my phone to use the SD card I can't download anything from google play. The download just remains stuck at 43,25 MB and I did everything to fix it. Reboot the phone, factory reset, formated the SD card, absolutely nothing solves it. When I commute the storage to the phone's internal memory everything works perfectly. How can I fix this? Please answer, do I need to change the SD card or what?"
none,"I'm going to a music festival the next summer with a bunch of friends, and every damn shit about it is expensive. I did my calculations and I can very well save up more than enough money for the tickets, etc until the next year. The problem is I always tend to spend every coin I have either on clothes, video games, weed etc and if I keep doing this be sure I'm not going anywhere. I need some tips on how to distract myself and keep my funds safe if anyone has been in my shoes."
none,"I know vanced is a thing now but, seriously what's the fucking problem with youtube these days. I can't watch any video without AT LEAST 3 or 4 ads spamming me. Oh and let's not forget the recently added YouTube Premium feature. Yes I know you are not bounded to pay for it but seriously why would you...? It was certainly better a few years ago when there we're not ads at all (or not so many if I am right) and the content destined for entertainment was also better, not so much cancer like now. Basically everyone's recommandation is filled with shitty 5 minute crafts videos, clickbaits, shitty vloggers who make really trashy pranks on strangers in public (yeah some of them are funny and are also found funny by the majority of the ,,victims'' so to say, but a big number of these pranks are really fucked up). Anyways, fuck YouTube now."
none,"I don't have AC in my apartment and I'm literally cooking during the day, and at night when you expect to be better it's the same, only difference is the huge mosquito population. Any tips on how to make life easier here?"
none,"I live in a relatively small town we're everyone knows each other in general, and recently I just managed to leave an extremely toxic group of friends. Anyways they live in the same neighbourhood as me and it's almost impossible not to encounter one of them when leaving to buy groceries for example. We still shake hands when we meet but I decline any invitation to hang out with them or talk too much I always fabricate some sort of excuse to leave the situation... However I have other good friends though who are really supportive and much better in general than those assholes. Btw I'm a 16M and no my parents aren't planning to move out in the future yet. I need tips to avoid their ,,hanging out'' radius if you know what I mean. Fortunately managed to convince my friends to hang out on more remote parts of the city. Thanks."
none,"I've only done alcohol and weed my whole life, my friends invited me to a beach music festival and I'm sure there are gonna be a lot of pills circulating there. I also talked to them about it and they offered me to try it when we go there, but I'm unsure of it, you know. I trust my source, they are close-friends so I'm not buying from any sketchy persons or strangers. They are pretty experienced with the effects and stuff like that, and instructed me to only take half of a pill or even a quarter since I'm a first-timer. I also know the basics, drink plenty of water, avoid alcohol, blah blah blah. How does it feel like for the first time? Thanks.EDIT: It all went REALLY REALLY well and I'm surprised I didn't had a comedown the next day. Listening to music felt so good, and got very horny as well. Definitely a drug that I'm going to use quite often. The only thing that made me uncomfortable was the teeth grinding but that quickly got solved by chewing gum."
none,"Turns out we had a fuck ton of things in common and the acid was extreme overkill on my part lol. Now it's 2am, still can't sleep for at least another 3 hours and I accepted to go thrift shopping with her in like 7 hours so I wish I was just sleeping like a baby after our first kiss right now. Moral of the story is we are great people with or without substances, or just don't make commitments for at least 24 hours if you drop acid idk lol."
none,"I saw a picture of a Pelican ™  and I thought wow that motherfucker looks so corageous and strong, look at those fierce eyes, but in reality it was just a dumb pelican thinking about fish or flying somewhere to get more fish maybe, we like to humanize animals so much"
none,"A music video of a couple dancing very sexy around the couch lol, the guy is kinda pretendí to sing to the girl and they dance around the appartment, I think the color palette was kinda blue or blue was part of the title? My mind is very blurry, I remember it was hoy tho, lol."

none,"Today I was driving back home from smoking with a friend and  I noticed my right rear light died so I was pretty anxious  thinking about running on a transit police car and getting a ticket or two cause I lost my driving license a few weeks ago and haven't got a new one, (I live in a shithole corrupt country so transit cars pull you over for any reason they can think to give you a ticket in hopes of you giving them money to let you go easier) then on a red traffic light I noticed the car just behind me had a broken left front light. He waited right besides me and a transit car passed just in front of us without stopping and we just looked at each other with a shit eating grin and part our ways. Made it home without issues and left me thinking about those dumb little moments when we connect with a stranger for a few seconds."
none,"I'm pretty okay with gore in general, I was exposed to dark shit since I was a kid because of internet and being edgy, but that shit broke me, it was a week ago and I still can't watch porn without thinking of it :(. Please, if you haven't seen it, don't do it, save yourself."

none,"I've never played it, just started, but got curious If it was lazy writing or is a plot point latter in the game/franchise?Because it looks like he didn't had a fairy just to make hem seem special in the intro, but Navi was just chilling around the Deku tree doing shit, I mean the kid was depressed, alone and having fucking nightmares since he was born watching the other play around with their fairies wondering why the fuck am I the only one without one? The poor kid was probably suicidal, but Navi chooses to fuck around the deku tree all day doing nothing instead of helping and accompanying the poor orphan depressed kid. Was Navi just being an asshole or she really had other endeavors and was already too busy before guiding link?"
none,"Hi, it's been a while since I had a stable friend to play with, I'm on GMT-5 and not a native English speaker, so it would be nice if we could practice via voice chat. I prefer playing with people around my age or older and preferably female, boys tend to be more competitive and want to max out production and I'm more inclined to having a nice relaxing play-trough."
none,"Is anyone having trouble with their iPhones or iPads? the stranges thing just happened to me, neither my iPhone SE 2016 nor my iPad 2017 are charging, i've tried two different bricks and cables and no difference, the battery indicator does change on the iPad (the iPhone died but the carger is recognized) but it never goes up. I feel is like a strange bug or something? cause the bricks work just fine I tested both, and also I also tested the cables and they work. I find it really strange that it happened to both my devices at the same time :/"
none,"I've always struggled with binge eating specially during the night and specially specially while having the munchies after smoking lol, but I've never thought about it until now, nothing is gonna happen to me if I don't get up and eat shit food tonight, I'll just be hungrier tomorrow and will have a nice delicious breakfast. And it's the same for all other good or bad habits, it's just shit our bodies do on automatic without thinking."

none,"I vaguely remember a PacMan game I used to play on my cousin PC, she had a bunch of DOS  games and other suff, the game was in 3D but the mazes were 2D like normal pacman, I'm not really sure if it was a real pacman game or a clone but I think there was underwater level and in other level you were in like a bedroom?"
none,"He is terribly ill (cirrhosis, non alcoholic, needs a transplant), his exwife just dropped him at our house after abandon him for months, his daughters (16 and 19) never really cared, he was alone and quickly deteriorating so it's better here with us. He can barely speak coherently and walk because his bloodstream is full of toxins that get to the brain caused by the liver failure. Well, I've been trying to cheer him up and today offer if he wants to watch a movie, asked what genres does he likes, and he broke my heart, he said: I want to watch an action movie, not romantic, I don't want to watch a love movie because of my disease, I can't love or be loved anymore. My father died when I was 12 and I was too young to understand and could never said goodbye to him or tell him that I loved him so much, so I'm really trying to make my uncle feel a bit better but it's getting to me, It makes me cry every day, and his fucking daughters, (he divorced like 12 years ago and they saw him from time to time and always sent them money for food and school, but his ex wife is a bitch and succesfully educated the girls her way so they quickly became less and less attached to him), he adores them, they just leave him to die, don't even call him, didn't care for him when it wasn't too late, and he thinks about them every day. Have you ever dealt with terminally ill people? have any advice for me or him?"
none,"I tried playing COD and DOOM on acid the other day, i couldn't bring myself to kill anybody lol, just wanted to explore, violence seemed meaningless and wasn't fun for me. On the other hand, I had New Super Mario Bros 2 on my 3ds and I enjoyed the shit out of it, just a simple, colorful experience with turtles dancing and shit. What are your preferences for gaming on acid?"
none,"I haven't had a console since the first Xbox and even that had a modchip eventually. The other day I was with some friends and one of them had an Xbox One S (he has no games, only uses it for playing Warzone) and other friend had a few Xbox 360 games. The Xbox one is supposedly backwards compatible so we decided to play some COD4 MW. And then the shit show happened:1. Once you insert the game, it doesn't works, it starts to download it from the internet (which took about 4 hours on our friend shitty internet)2. Once it's installed, it doesn't works either, YOU NEED THE ORIGINAL GAME INSERTED ANYWAY to prove it's yours... Needles to say, we only played one game that afternoon because there's no way we would wait another four hours just to choose a different disk.What a fucking load of bullshit of a system, I remember when playing a game involved just putting it in, when it didn't matter if you had internet connection."
none,"I hear people all the time saying it would be great to be a dog or a cat and being petted/kissed/hugged all the time but in reality are we really mature and self confident enough for that? I mean some of us have a hard time accepting others on our personal space even when having strong personal connections like family or friends, I am certainly not ready to be told by a stranger I'm a good boy. In summary, I don't want to be loved like a dog, I want to be able to let myself be loved like them."
none,"About a month ago I got my first 3DS (a new3DSXL) and the 3D effect really is something, I don't know if it was because I was high as a kite yesterday but  I started thinking, the effect is really cool isn't it? Itmakes the colors pop out, you can really see where you are jumping on 3D platformers, and once your eyes adjust for the first weeks (in my experience) it's possible to play for hours without much eye strain or headaches. And then it made me all sad all this years I avoided the 3DS as the plague, thinking it was stupid based on other people saying it's just a gimmick, nothing more, but for me the 3D screen trully is a unique way to enjoy your games and totally adds to the experience. What's your opinion on the 3D effect?[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/gm3qrf)"
none,"I'm just learning this is a common issue with this computer, after I started having problems I swapped my CMOS battery I used the little blue key reset BIOS thingy that comes in the motherboard (as you can see I'm no expert in computers). It worked fine for a few days, then I had to do the reset bios thing every time I boot to get it to work, ok fine, but today it stopped sending video out, yesterday I was gaming perfectly fine and today I was just downloading some google drive files and the screen went black, tried resetting the pc, nothing, resetting the bios again, no luck. What are your thoughts? Have you experienced something similar? If so, I'd like to know if it can be fixed, but I'm starting to think my poor pc might be dead. Not even mad, it lasted like a champ for like five years which is more than okay for the value I got."
none,"I was reading Marc's bio on wikipedia and I find amusing that he studied piano as a child, tried acting for a year and worked in a call center later. Now he makes music while acting and entertaining as he handles callers perfectly on his livestreams. He basically combined all his habilities in one perfect job for him :O"
none,"I don't know if it's normal or not but I have a feeling it might be pretty common for kitchen workers to abuse substances lol, do you tend to smoke much more while working? I'm currently smoking half a pack a day on work days and one or two on my free days, sometimes I don't even smoke but at work I can't help it. What do you recommend for quitting smoking at work?"
none,"Imagine telling somebody who is blind, can't walk or suffers from a mental disorder he is a piece of shit and deserves to die, that they are the worst of humanity. That would be awful, then why is it okay to do it to criminals? They once were kids, once were innocent, they are people just like us, it's just their minds doesn't work the way it should so they are violent or antisocial. What they need is help to recover their mental health not rot in a cell or worse. Obviously, as other health disorders not everything has a cure but they deserve a chance. Am I being too innocent?"
none,"I work at a small kitchen, I am the only cook and usually serve to 20-30 clients every night, I rarely go out the kitchen but when I see the orders sometimes I go like oh is this guy again” lol, does it ever happen to you?"
none,"Long story, I work at a bar, this guy was a waiter there, just quit las week and went for a drink and his last paycheck. He stayed long past closing time and when we finished our work he wanted to leave with us (me and manager) and share an Uber. He didn't ask us, we had our bikes and didn't want to pay. He didn't want to pay a full Uber by himself so fuck it, I offer to take the manager on her bike (she is really petite so it wasn't a problem) and offer mine to him cause I really wanted to be home (the bar closes at 2 am and we finish cleaning and everything at 3am normally so fuck that I wanted to sleep). We leave and a few minutes later police stopped us (I live in Mexico btw so corrupt police is the norm). They check our bags and interrogate us and find nothing (luckily) but found traces of marijuana on him (illegal here). The officers start to threaten him and he starts lying, that he was working that day (after I already told the officers he was no longer our coworker), that the jacket where they found the pot was his brother's, that he didn't consume anything (he was drunk and high), and the officers didn't swallow his bullshit. They came to me and the manager and told us to leave, that we were free to go, and since she had a substancial amount of pot the officer didn't found and I had a month of salary on my pocket that I didn't want to lose (get stolen by fucking police) cause I have bills to pay  we decide to leave. They assure us they will release him in a pinch and we have nothing to worry about, but I just can't trust police. Needles to say, he was pretty pissed that we leaved him behind and I haven't heard anything from him, he doesn't respond my messages but I see him online, so I hope he is just angry at me. I tried to stay but my female coworker didn't want to ride alone home at 3am and didn't want to stay either with illegal substances next to 4 pissed police officers. Am I the Asshole for leaving him?"

none,I wanna have a pretty intense trip would all these low doses work together to be really intense or should I take more. Maybe 150ug then thirty minutes later late 1.5g shrooms and 150 seeds. I have lots of experience with tripping so I can handle a really intense experience
none,Can I do a cwe in just like two ounces of water and then let it evaporate a bunch til there's so little left that I can drop it on some sour patch kids or will the LSA get fucked

none,I have a screen that has some fairly large holes so I get a bunch of kief. It's still basically kief just a bit less potent. I prefer it this way cause then I can top every bowl with a bunch of kief
none,I bought some of those 350ug double dosed” tabs and I know it's probably bs but I wanna still be careful in case they're more potent. I wanna take half and then an hour later if I'm not tripping hard I'll take the other half but I'm worried there will be tolerance by then. I've done two shroom trips back to back without experiencing that much tolerance so I figure my tolerance wouldn't boom after just an hour.
none,"Update: I'm alright I had a great tripI'm still the same depressed piece of shit I just feel different, I wish I took DXM. I'm taking another 1.5 grams I'll see you all in hell when I finally kill myself.

none,I got prescribed adderall so I'm gonna be on amphs and I'm wondering if I should skip my dose on the days I do DXM. Maybe I could take it in the morning and just not redose in the middle of the day cause I like to take DXM at night
none,I feel like that's a appropriate way of dosing it out to make sure I don't over consume
none,Said this on r/DXM too. It's especially true for dph. A little anxiety is fine and normal but if you're really nervous you should lower it or wait a day or two. Dph is awful and dangerous but if it's really what you want to spend your time doing you should be as careful as possible
none,Lower it or wait a day or two. Don't try to hype yourself up or something to take a dose. It's okay to have a little nervousness for your first time but if it's a lot you can always wait

none,I checked the dosage info both are 30mg per 5ml
none,So a few people in my band wanna do DXM and I figured it'd be cool to crush up robotablets and put em in like a slushee or something. We're all under 21 so no alcohol sadly however I figure we could figure out some way to get it in a drink.Edit: I am a bit stupid this is a bad idea
none,"I get very light nausea from DXM just on the come up but it goes away. I've puked on road trips tho cause it's bad. If I'm a passenger is it alright to take 8 robotablets, a Dramamine, and wash it down with ginger beer?"
none,"9:20 PM drank 40 ml delsym10:30 PM took 90mg DXM HBRI was expecting the peaks to line up since I took them like this, I figured the 90mg HBR would add just a little kick to the poliI was wrong12:00 AM: peaking and fucking euphoric as hell. Loving everyone. Way stronger visuals than from 65ml poli. I was having an amazing time. 1:00 AM: this is around when I started coming down, I thought it was over and had a good time. It wasn't as extreme as my last time but I understood cause I was at a lower dose. 2:00 AM: OH FUCK IT ISNT OVER. I got hit with a second peak unexpectedly and laid down on the floor for an hour rolling around. 3:00 AM: I started messaging my friends and bf on discord telling them about how cool my trip is. All of them said it sounds pretty neat and I was very happy. I don't really remember the next few hours but I was basically on discord in bed and in a chair and I kept switching where I was sitting.7:00 AM: Had an amazing talk with my dad about all the stuff we've done as a family and all my childhood memories of our vacations through the closed bathroom door while he was taking a shit.8:30 AM: walked around downstairs for a while just thinking about my life and how simple it seems10/10 experienceAfter I woke up the next day I thought back to how much 90mg HBR and the come up for poli effected me. It was emotionally a little weaker than 390mg poli but the visuals were crazy. The most visuals I have ever gotten from anything (only gotten lower dose visuals off dph and crazy high dose visuals off weed and mid dose visuals off DXM) I'm buying robotablets soon so we'll just have to wait and see after I take 4 to figure out if I'm really enzyme deficient"
none,Turn the heat on your shower just to the point where it feels a lil cold but not like freezing of course. It's refreshing as hell and super nice on DXM. Helps completely sort your brain. Do not wash your legs cause it'll drip on the floor and make it slippery. Since you're a lil impaired coordination wise you don't wanna add a slipping hazard
none,So I have no stimulant tolerance I am short and skinny but basically I decided to do a lil adderall and here I am I've been up all night and it is 3 PM1:54 AM: 50mg caffeine2:44 AM: 10mg adderall8:19 AM: 10mg methylphenidate 10:44 AM: 100mg caffeineWhy my pee smell weird also feel fast when I'm sitting down I'm gonna be awake forever honestly this kinda sucks but I like it I probably burned like 1000 calories

none,So I can't put my home brew in the fridge to cold crash it because my parents would be upset that I'm drinking and I don't want them to know yet.

none,"From their press release today that made it jump 25% at close:3:39p ET 7/6/2021 - Globe Newswire Shining a Light on a New Hope for a Rare Form of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma: Conversation with Dr. Ellen Kim on HyBryte(TM) from Soligenix Mentioned:	SNGX via NewMediaWire -- PCG Digital -- A rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) has no current FDA-approved first-line therapies. There are roughly 3,000 new CTCL cases in the United States each year, with more than 20,000 patients living with CTCL.Small cap biotech Soligenix (Nasdaq: SNGX) is developing and moving toward potential commercialization of HyBryte(TM) (SGX301 or synthetic hypericin) as a novel first in class photodynamic therapy utilizing safe visible light for the treatment of early stage CTCL.Recently Dr. Ellen Kim, Medical Director of the Dermatology Clinic for the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine, Professor of Dermatology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and the Lead Principal Investigator for Soligenix's positive Phase 3 FLASH (Fluorescent Light Activated Synthetic Hypericin) study in CTCL, recently presented key details of HyBryte's(TM) efficacy and safety profile at the United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC) Annual Meeting.We caught up with Dr. Kim shortly after the meeting to discuss the HyBryte(TM) data and the current treatment landscape for CTCL.Question:How does HyBryte(TM) stack up to other treatments that you've been using in your practice? If it gains FDA approval, how will that affect your approach to treating Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)?Answer:HyBryte(TM) is as effective, and has better short term, and possibly long term, safety profile than current skin directed therapies. It is also effective for CTCL plaques which are traditionally more refractory to many skin directed treatments. Given this, it will be used both as first line therapy for my early stage patients and for patients who can't continue other therapies due to side effects or loss of response.Question:HyBryte(TM) uses visible light as opposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Penn Medicine, as well as most centers treating this disease, is currently using UV treatments for CTCL. Is HyBryte(TM), in your opinion, a safer option?Answer:HyBryte(TM) has a definite advantage over phototherapy long term - its mechanism of action is distinct from ultraviolet phototherapy and is non-mutagenic so the risk of developing actinic skin damage and skin cancers is lower. Short term side effects were also less common and milder than what we see in traditional phototherapy.Questionr. Kim, on the Penn Medicine website, it lists Photopheresis and T-Cell Lymphoma Phototherapy as two different treatments. Can you describe the difference between the two? Is one more effective than the other? Where would you classify HyBryte(TM)?Answer:Phototherapy is a skin-directed treatment utilizing either ultraviolet A or B light and is used primarily in early stage CTCL.Expecting this to reach $2 by the end of the week!"

none,"Last night I took 375 μg (my highest dose yet) and had a pretty good trip. But then around hour 13 I still felt like I was tripping and I couldn't sleep at all. I wanted nothing more than to sober up and pass out but couldn't make it happen. This made me worry that I would never fully come down from the trip and had somehow changed my baseline level of consciousness. Also at this point I started picturing horrible things like killing myself or my friend, even though I really didn't want to do them; I just was picturing them. I think this was because at this point I thought I was entering psychosis and associated horrible things with psychosis. Luckily I ended up taking a few melatonin and passing out. Now after having slept a few hours, I feel much better and connected to reality but am still kind scared of how my mental state was today. This was my 10th trip and my highest dose and I've also been taking Accutane which has depression/suicidal ideation as a darker side effect.

none,I'm planning on picking up a handle tonight and I'm looking for the best bang for my buck. I usually choose vodka or rum but would love to hear any suggestions!
none,"Probably about 10 times a day, I get random mini bursts of energy that I call brain tingles. They don't exactly give me any actual energy, but it makes me feel slightly more alert/aware of myself if that makes sense (it's hard to explain.) Is this normal?"

none,"After smoking pretty much every other day this summer, I got sick and went out of town so I ended up going 10 days without getting high. Now that my break is done, I've smoked twice since then and am surprisingly higher than what I expected. And not only do I feel ""higher"", but it also just feels more like how it felt when I first started smoking which is amazingI highly recommend taking a 2 week tolerance break or so and then enjoying getting absolutely chopped when you smoke again after it"

Regular Gov and Health/PEAre there any major red flags on my schedule here? If this looks like way too much, I can drop AP Chem and independently study AP CSP to make life a bit easier while still getting the weighted grade. Also, I took regular chem last year and finished with a 98 overall, so I have a decent chem background."

none,"I haven't smoked alone in a while and I'm intending to get back into it, but I don't know which method to use.I have a Boundless CFC which is a dry herb pen that I could pick up bud for, or I could buy a 510 threaded battery and pick up gram cartridges for $30. Which method do you think would be more enjoyable/ cheaper for me? Also, I live at home so I know that cartridges would be easier to hide, but I've used the herb vape and hidden it without failure as well."
none,I'm a psychedelic weed guy sometimes drink but fuck. Yesterday there was big party and we were on like shot 10 and then some dude pulls up a pipe and puts in 10mg pill and starts smoking that shit smelling like cat piss.

After some solid seconds with no blinking my vision goes blurry and then the object/ ground i was looking for fills in my whole vision basically to corners everywhere and it swirls a little just like some acid visuals. Idk probably suck at describing

I set up a brand new adress that hasent been used before and orders LSD again. And it got seized again? like what the actual fuck. And it was a good high rated vendor aswell. Are sweden customs just fucking insane that spot blotters or a ziplock bag and just opens everything coming with it? Idk im confused and trying to find whats going on
none,how is that possible? Can you guys even flick? Its so uncomfortable to try out and shit. I always used 1200 dpi 0.8 sens on my 1280x1024 achieved global easily and a good ESEA rank. Can imagine even the struggle to check positions on bombite if you have to move mouse 3 times through whole pad just to do an 180
none,"Can someone be born without any cannabinoid receptors or lack serotonin receptors and opioid ones? Like this dude is the weirdest ""human being"" i meet some kind of high-powered mutant never even considered for mass production. We tried weed on him 20 times. Reaching from bong, edibles pipes joints, And the inhale technique is good no wrong in that. Then we said alright fuck it lets get him some other shit. LSD 500 ug we tested with kit and took from same batch just good acid. This dude didnt get no effect from that either. Everything went from his own paycheck so he got frustrated and wanted to give up but i tried to hold his hopes up. Then we tried molly. Now this was different. HE FELT SOMETHING! but not the natural lol. So we started with 300 mg of pure mdma crystals also tested with kit and on ourselves in the good batch from Netherlands. He didnt feel euphoria. He didnt get no love. All he got was body shakes and dilated pupils. Thats it nothing more. Like what the actual fuck\`? So we said fuck it serotogenic drugs doesnt work. Cannabinoids doesnt work lets try something from a different genre, something that targets way different receptors. We tried Tramadol and later some oxys. Now its where we all gave up and just wondered how is he even a human being. He didnt feel shit from that either. Just sharing my story. This dude doesnt have any medical conditions apart from being depressed as fuck, hes neither not on any kind of medication which i know some affects the effects from different drugs. Maybe he just werent born with serotonin recepts lol nor opioid which is fucking weird nor cannabinoid? Were gonna try DMT and salvia on him soon so ill still got a grain of hope. Sorry for my english maybe someone knows what the fuck is onBut for some weird reason he can feel alcohol lol. Gaba receptors alive? Then i suppose benzos would work huh?"
none,it was sent 11-20 and im still waiting. 16 businessdays later and its still not in the mailbox. Am I awaiting a customs letter? Tho it was LSD so i kinda doubt it was busted
none,I've rolled 2 days ago. Followed harm reduction waited 3 months I've only taken 150mg and I drink water and exercise regularly? Fairly good chance to pass?
none,"So I got some really clean molly. Ive tested it and weighted about 150mg. So basically my peak lasted 1.5h and the whole roll lasted about 3 hours. Is this normal? I always follow 3 month rule and drink water during the roll. But I ate a pizza like 2 hours prior dropping, could this affect it?"
none,Dont wanna wake anybody. My idea was to stay on PC listen to some music maybe draw using one of my apps take a shower later on and then just enjoy myself in the bed from this cozy ass feeling. Will I have fun alone like that?
none,"So I remember like 2 years ago I ate a big ass juicy nice kebab pizza and it literally took 3 hours to kick in LOL. At first i thought it was trash ass crystal :( And just went on sofa to watch some family guy cuz i was boring as hell and then it just randomly kicked in. It was so much confusion but the roll turned out to be the best one. Like I ate the pizza now should I wait half an hour or an hour to drop? Like does eating only delays the kick in or it dulls the roll on itself? Dont wanna waste my 3 months, peace!"
none,So like i know frequent smoking prelongs it being there but like when youre totally clean from weed in your body and take a couple puffs does it mean you can get it out in 4-5 days by exercising drinking alot of water etc? Or will it be there for way longer again? Ived smoked like 0.1g hash from pipe.
none,so ive been hustling for a time and now theres this dude that i didnt know him well but he was around in our group since kids. He want to buy everything i have and he will only meet me in some shady ass place while i insisted to do it just where i regularly drop off. Heard its usually a red flag while getting robbed. Also what advice do you have to avoid those situations

none,Jag röker hasch då och då. Drabbas av extrem insomnia och ingenting har hjälp mig bättre än lite brunt på kvällen att kunna somna istället för att försöka 4 timmar. Förekom några misstankar (fucking snitches som har inget vettigt att göra) Så nu sa rektorn att jag måste pissa regulert annars kan dom avstänga mig. Kan dom ens göra så här? Vafan
none,Idk if this is by every country but im located in Sweden. My adress is burnt internationally and I would like to continue ordering. So what if i find a line of mailboxes near my house. Can I buy a mailbox put it there with the correct adress correct postnumber but a fake name? Will the post service give a fuck if noone by this name lives there but the adress and name is correct by the letter and the mailbox? Ive been a greedy bastard Ive always ordered LSD and got pretty tempted to buy some 2cb. But of course it got seized and now every order gets seized. Im trying to find a solution i dont really wanna risk ordering to someone elses because the deliveries are pretty long because of covid. Anyone knows?Sorry for mine english its not my first language.
none,Fuck off birds what the fuck have I ever done to you I fuxking appreciated you before but now I'm fucking exhausted and I want to fucking sleep
none,Kan dom trakassera dig hur dom vill eller måste de ha en anledning? Till exempel jag är inte hög eller något så kommer fram några grisar och säger att jag ser lite påverkad ut. Kan jag neka ett eller inte? Och ifall jag blir positiv brukar dom inleda en husrannsakan? Jag är lite paranoid och bara tänkte om själva grejen
none,Det finns ett par styck brevlådor vid mig där jag bor. Min adress är flaggad och kan inte beställa internationellt. Kan jag skaffa en brevlåda sätta upp den där och komma på ett namn. Adressen kommer stämma ju. Kommer posten fortfarande dela ut brevet till brevlådan även om namnet stämmer inte med folk som bor där? Eller bryr de inte sig så länge adressen och namnet på brevet stämmer?Köpter fortfarande inrikes men finns en vara som jag kommer vilja fortfarande köpa internationellt.

I think if you dont take more than 200mg /planing on taking 150-125 drinking water regulary and when you feel ur overheating a little bit you got outside for some fresh air and go back? Could I get some more tips so stay safe on a rave. Good evening everyone yall are special 
none,I want to know how drugs will affect you when ur old like 60+ something. What kind of drugs did you use? For how long and how do you feel now? No anti drug post just curious of the long term effects of drugs even when u were kind of responsible with them and didnt notice anything before.

none,hello im inda drunk and wanna smoe some bud. So basically i had 15 day pause i was negative smoked 4 days ago and got test in 2 weeks. I always smoke little bit. I wanna smoke like 0.1 g of hash in my pipe right now. I exercise i drink alot of water everyday and wondering if i ahve a good chance of getting clean in 2 weeks right. Love yall wondering
none,So what do you guys do dropping at night? I want to do a little list. Whenever i drop at night its usually putting me through alot of thought loops. I usually spend my first 4-5 hours being in my room watching a movie and other shit. Then I take a shower because hey its magical on Lucy. But then I feel completed and i still got half of a trip left. What do you guys usually do night tripping? Going outside idk i live in the middle of nowhere so its dark and theres no lights.
none,is this combo safe? Were gonna have a little bit fun soon. Of course we wont go crazy with alcohol. Just like 4 or 6 shots
none,I do not understand why every market exist 2-3 months then either exit scams or get seized by law enforcement. It was not the case a year ago. Did the feds start an operation or whats the cause?
none,"So here you go country. If you test someone for drugs over a longer period they will quit weed but they will start with something far more damaging. Fucking idiot society, anyway what drug could you use that has the similiar effects to weed or just as safe as weed? Like i thought about kratom but it kinda spooked me out its an ""opioid"". Then I thought about ketamine but that shit cant you use more than once a week (best once a month lmao) I dont take benzo or opiates under consideration aswell."
none,Im shocked positively now. I can go back to mine school. Ive been smoking everyday for months and i was getting drug tested the same day late at evening. So ive drank alot of water. Like pissed 7 times before the test. Ive had mine friends piss in the pants but it didnt cut it when i got into the building they fucking look at ur piss. So im like ggwp boys pissed in and it came back as negative. Before the test i drank 1 L of water mixed with lemon heard it boost vitamin C so the test wont be blank. Im fucking happy
none,will my new shortfill be 80/20 vg pg or do i need to add 2 of those. Sorry my questionmark doesnt work on this shitty ass looking ass keyboard
none,Are there any scientific studies that confirms the 3month rule being effective to reduce the damage significantly? Got into argument with someone and couldn't link any studies because I've only heard about it in this sub claiming it's safe to do every 3 month
none,"I'm just wondering if it can damage you or make you ""retarded"" like some people said. Most likely the negative stigma around it but just wanted ask in this community "
none,"[NAC Study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24634-3)Hey y'all,I have Lyme, EBV, HHV6 and other infections. I've been increasing my antioxidant intake with supplements like NAC, Glutathione and ALA . This study has me concerned about my antioxidant use, specifically NAC  I plan to discontinue its use but I am curious what the folks in this sub have to say . Thanks friends."
none,"Hey y'all, I've been dealing with some nasty neuralgia lately. I suspect it's post herpetic, and or Lyme induced. When I take DHF the nerve inflammation goes down drastically which is great. What I'm confused by are the muscle twitches that accompany this relief. The twitching occurs along the same path as the nerve pain, along my right arm. Do y'all think this is a sign of healing, or potential damage? I appreciate any theories."
none,"For those of you with neuro Lyme, im wondering if your neurological symptoms present mostly on one side of your body. My nerve problems present mostly on my right side. Is this somewhat common? I'm worried about Parkinson's and other neuro degenerative diseases. Looking for some insight."
none,"Hey y'all, My died dad a few years back and left me a large collection of cards from the 80s and 90s, mainly hoops. He has full sets from every year and plenty of unopened boxes.

Is eBay the best marketplace. Im grateful for all the feedback. Thanks."

Trying to balance folate etc  Now I think I'm in a situation where I'm creating too much Sam-E and it's causing Parkinson's like symptoms. I have had great success using NAD+ supplements but I don't want to further deplete my methyl stores. Gang, I'm at a loss and would really appreciate some insight. Thanks "
none,Concerned about Uridine use with possible b12 deficiency.I haven't had my b12 levels checked but I'm sure they're low. I injected myself with b12 daily for about 4 days 1-3mg  prior to supplementing with uridine. I continued injecting and taking mthfr throughout the 2 week period while I was on uridine. My uridine dose never exceeded 250mg daily. I'm concerned about cancer. Can y'all talk me off the ledge here?

Thanks y'all"
none,"Hey friends,It's my first time posting but I'm a long time worrier. For the last three years I've been dealing with terrible nerve pain throughout my body. I've had a battery of tests run which showed that I have (or had depending on who you ask) the following: EBV, Shingles, Coxackie-A, Lyme Disease and HHV-6. What brings me to this sub are the symptoms that I think are associated with the above. I don't know though and it is honestly ruling my every thought. Mainly I'm talking about the twitching and tremoring that I experience. It's awful. It happens randomly throughout the day all throughout my body. I've had an MRI which came back clear and am awaiting both an EEG and EMG. I'm worried I have ALS or Parkinson's. Honestly just typing those two words sent me into a terrible anxiety hole, it's crazy. For those of you who don't know, chronic Lyme disease isn't really recognized by most western doctors. I took two of what they call the standard western blot” tests and they both came back negative. I shelled out thousands of dollars to take a Lyme test through a company called igenix. That one came back positive, like super positive. When I started treating my Lyme with antibiotics, I ended up with a C. Diff infection. I'm now treating it with herbs but I'm not sure if it's really doing much, or if I even have Lyme. Can you tell I'm losing my shit? The same doctors who refuse to acknowledge and treat Lyme disease are the same ones who poo poo the idea of infections like EBV and shingles can be chronic. They use terms like post herpetic neuralgia” instead of yo you still have shingles and it's causing crazy nerve pain.” I guess what I'm saying is that I don't who to believe or how to calm my mind around any one theory. The fact is that these twitches and tremors have me freaked. My neurologist agreed to order the EEG and EMG only begrudgingly, while assuring me that I wasn't displaying those symptoms. I know that there is such a thing as benign fasiculation syndrome that's to Reddit. I suspect that's the term doctors give to a case like mine with an unknown cause. I don't know yall . I'm scared constantly and I can't stop looking shit up. My whole life revolves around this.For those of you still reading, thank you. Feel free to comment and let me know if you can relate or if you can offer some sage advice. ✌️+❤️"
none,"It seems like I have excess folate/Sam. Every time I take creatine, folate and Sam-e I tremble and tremor terribly. Glycine seems to help. Perhaps it's mopping up excess folate/Sam . Can anyone help me better understand this?"
none,Does anyone have a tight jaw with occasional twitching?
none,Does anyone know if I can safely add polygala to my stack while taking these two drugs? I really appreciate the responses.
none,"I'm wondering if anyone can explain to me how 7,8DHF supplementation might affect nerve health. I have some neurological issues like inflammation, tremors and twitching due to neuro Lyme and subsequent methylation issues.

none,Can someone please explain to me why I should be avoiding folic acid?
none,So when I take TMG alone I get twitching in my jaw and elsewhere.When I take creatine alone i end up with terrible tremors.When I take b12 with these two I don't experience either symptom as much...Can someone please help me understand this?
none,"Hey friends,So I have a pretty severe b12/folate deficiency. I've been self injecting with b12 for the last week or so. I've been taking the necessary co factors like B6, Magnesium, Potassium and TMG. I get twitches and tremoring when I don't have enough of these cofactors, especially when I don't take enough TMG. I guess I'm wondering if this is normal, the twitching/tremoring/tight jaw without the appropriate amount of these cofactors?More importantly, I've read a bit about how you can have too much TMG. I always feel like i need more...So I'm wondering..... How much is too much?I appreciate ya'll. Thanks"
none,"Hi friends,I'm not sure if I'm reading this right but this article seems to suggest that supplementing with folate can decrease the efficacy of Lamictal. This is troublesome for me as I am working through a severe folate/b12 deficiency.

none,"Hey friends,Thanks for taking the time to read this. I've been self injecting for a little over a week now. In that time my internal tremors have noticeably worsened. I'm taking potassium, magnesium, TMG etc  I know it's somewhat common to feel worse before you feel better but I'm getting scared . Has anyone else had a similar experience?"

They have been helpful but I'm really missing my polygala....Can someone smarter than me weigh in on the potential safety profile of this combo?Thank you!"
none,"So I just got back from my neurology appointment where we discussed my MRI results. It came back clear of lesions. My nerve pain, twitching, Fasciculations, restlessness etc... are the worst they've ever been. I have weakness in my arms and legs with lots and lots of tremoring. I'm happy to see that I don't technically have MS but now I'm worried about ALS. My neurologist ordered and EMG but I'll have to wait a couple months at least for that. I don't know y'all.... I just don't know how to calm down around all of this. I'm only 34 and this disease has ruined me. Every time I take antibiotics I end up with C Diff. I just restarted the herbal protocol yesterday. I just don't know how to calm the eff down while I wait for this EMG. I'm pretty sure at this point that my neurological symptoms can be traced back to Lymes and significant B12 deficiency in the form of pernicious anemia but I just don't know. I should mention too that my Lyme test from igenix came back very positive fwiw.....I'm so grateful to those of you who have taken the time to read this and respond. This community has been really helpful. So I guess I'm wondering if anyone can provide some insight into my situation. I need to keep my shit together while I wait for this EMG. I would love to hear from people with similar symptoms..Thanks again y'all, for real. ✌️ + ❤️"

none,"I'm a 34 year old guy. I've been experiencing Parkinson's like symptoms for a couple of years now.I have had bad nerve inflammation through my vagus nerve out into my arms and legs and jaw.I developed an internal and sometimes external tremor that can last up to 40 mins. I twitch anytime I take a supplement that works on my dopamine like tyrosine or with any mthfr supplement like TMG or B12. B vitamins give me energy but also induce mania. I also have uncontrollable anxiety constantly.I have restless leg on my right side and my arm will also go restless on that side too. My gait is messed up too. I'm walking slower than usual and just don't really feel comfortable in my body at all if that makes sense. I have pins and needles feelings in my legs at various points in the day, especially when I wake up. What worries me is that I used to (it's been over 1.5 years) use mucuna powder. It was only 4% L-Dopa but I'm really concerned that I gave myself PD by using this herb indiscriminately. (I was throwing spoonfuls into my smoothies) I also have have Lyme disease and bad EBV which could be contributing or perhaps mimicking PD.I am so in love with my wonderful perfect wife and feel so bad for the amount of care that I need. Maybe we could connect her to other spouses or caregivers?I had my first appointment with a neurologist recently. Honestly, he was an asshole and didn't even want to order an MRI until he conducted a neurological exam and noticed some of my reflexes weren't firing and that my gait was off. I asked about PD and he quickly dismissed the possibility based on my age and lack of symptoms” I have my MRI scheduled for this Thursday. I suppose it could be MS but I'm really concerned about PD. I guess I'm just really overwhelmed. Does this sound like PD? Any words of wisdom or encouragement is deeply appreciated."
none,"Hey y'all,I've come to a difficult realization today, I cannot figure this out on my own while I'm feeling this way. I suspect that I am glutathione/b12 deficient but everyone I take methylated b vitamins I get manic and show many neurological symptoms like twitching. I've worried that I caused this by screwing up my dopamine from using mucuna powder on the past (haven't used it in over 1.5 years). I have a bunch of auto immune issues as well including but not limited to Lyme, Bart, EBV, HHV6....I'm now realizing more and more based on the aforementioned reactions that this is related to my genetics. I completed the 23 and me gene analysis and had it analyzed by promethiase. I'm driving myself crazy trying to make sense of my neurological problems relative to my genetic results. I am in need of a methylation specialist, right? Would that be the right title? I'm on disability and thus have Medicaid which I would  ideally like to utilize for this purpose, if that's even possible. I don't have much money but I am willing to pay out of pocket for some online guidance or something.. I would really appreciate any guidance and support with this.

none,I have had what I thought were a few successful FMTs. My bowel movements were solid for a few days after but now they're back to watery. I've been taking lots of magnesium and vitamin C which may be contributing. My cramps have lessened substantially. I'm worried that I'm having a relapse. Maybe it just PI-IBS. Thoughts?
none,This whole thing is maddening y'all. I took some TMG yesterday without the B cofactors and ended up having bad nerve pain and twitching. I added the B complex and ended up super manic. That combo wakes me up but also makes me super manic. Any ideas?

none,"Hey ya'll,It seems like the FMTs are working for, I've had some good looking, solid bowel movements the last 3 days now. I'm hoping I'm out of the woods with the infection. I am starting to crave coffee again. Is this a terrible idea?"
none,I just had a vitamin IV drip that contained calcium. I didn't have any cramps before starting it but now I'm cramping again. My wife thinks it's okay because the calcium was administered via IV and so it would bypass the gut. Thoughts?
none,"Hey y'all,Thanks for taking the time to read this. I've been struggling with C. Diff this last week. I have had two consecutive FMT treatments the last two days. The crazy acidic cramping pain has subsided but the cramping on my left side has persisted. I maybe over ate a bit yesterday which could be contributing. I guess I'm just wondering if it's common to still have cramping after a couple FMT treatments. I haven't pooped since starting them but I'm hoping to have a healthy bowel movement sometime today. Please let me know what y'all think. Thanks again."

Well anyway, I noticed an increase in energy and a decrease in depression while on the NMN.

I've read some conflicting info online about how NMN affects the nerves and the nervous system more generally.Again, these existing neurological issues may have been exacerbated by the introduction of antibiotics as a part of my lyme treatment but I just don't know. I would love to continue to supplement with NMN if possible, but don't want to worsen an already delicate nervous system. I'd be so grateful for any insight into this topic.

I have used it to help me through some of my worst traumas. Now every time I ingest even the smallest amount of thc I get this awful tightness, this nerve pain on my left side, upper abdomen. I suspect that I have developed MS or that the Lyme has progressed to such a degree that these ""MS Hugs"" are becoming more and more present. This was actually my very first symptom over 2 years ago. I for the longest time thought it was a symptom of CHS, cannabis hypermesis syndrome.     The only :/  infections that have shown up in my testing have been  EBV,HHV6, Pneumonia, Coxsackie.....   I'm trying to get my money up to pay for an Igenix test to confirm my Lyme status. I'm also waiting for a referral to a neurologist So i can get an MRI....   I'm overwhelmed by what the future holds for me. I know of people who's Lyme symptoms have mimicked MS and have found relief of those  symptoms through Lyme treatment         I don't know how to cope anymore. Without cannabis, I have this manic need to constantly research what might be happening to me. I've been prescribed pharmaceuticals like gabapentin and trazodone for nerve pain and insomnia respectively but I'm afraid of becoming physically and psychologically dependent on them........                                                             My theory is that the Lyme has wrecked my CNS and therefore my endocannabanoid system as well. I'm thinking that every time I activate these receptors via ingestion, I'm reminded of that damage via this nerve pain. I just can't seem to calm down and I'm mourning my the loss of my favorite plant friend."
none,"Hi, I'm new here and just wanted to do an intro and ask for people's reflections of what it was like for you when you were first trying to get a diagnosis? It's been years of going doc to doc trying to figure out what is happening to me, and finally of course during covid and all this research I've been doing I kept landing on MS being a possibility. Right now I'm waiting on an appointment with my PC to get a referral, everything is so backed up because of the pandemic, but I have a neuro office picked out and will hopefully be able to get in for a consult and MRI by the end of Feb or early March. It would comfort me to hear about everyone's experiences when they were first figuring this out and how it was finding the right neurologist, picking the right treatment, symptom management, etc. I'm dealing with severe nerve pain, twitching and weakness all through my face, jaw, neck, arms and legs. My vagus nerve is definitely affected, painful and inflamed and feels super frayed and I have chest tightness and some digestive issues because of that. I have overwhelming and debilitating anxiety, fear, and depression. I cannot calm down my nervous system at all throughout the day let alone enough to sleep at night. My PC prescribed Gabapentin but I've been so worried about dependency that I've only taken it one time a couple of days ago before bed, 100 mg, it made my nerve pain a little worse but made me drowsy for the first time in months. I've heard it is pretty much useless until you get to at least 300 mg/day but I'm trying to keep my dose low. I'm a long time cannabis user but my CNS has been so fucked up from all of this that THC actually makes my physical symptoms worse now, so I've been trying CBD tinctures and they help a little but not even close to enough to really be worth it. I just need to get to the diagnosis but I don't really know how to orient my mind or calm down enough to get to that point. Anything that helped anyone get through day to day, night to night, before they reached proper care and treatment would be so appreciated. Thanks in advance."
none,"Does anyone do low doses every other day? I'm just terrified of dependence, having a history of addiction and am trying to do one day on gabapentin, one day off.

none,"I've been taking polygala which has helped greatly with my depression. I'm almost certain that iPolygala's MAOI properties have helped me get out of bed/my head and be functional again. I have no doubt that it's effects on dopamine as well as the HPA axis are at the root of this change. Unfortunately after dosing for about a week, I seem to have developed a strange intolerance to the plant. I'm cutting other things (Lions mane, reishi, cordyceps, chaga) out currently to confirm which supplement has caused what feels like an awful immuno-suppresent/immuno-modulating response.

none,"My story of chronic illness is a long one but is finally filtering into a particular direction which made me want to reach out to this community and see if I am alone or if there are more of you out there who might have some additional insights, or who might benefit from my story. I was diagnosed with a reactivated EBV infection in late January, after ruling out almost every other possible thing via xrays, CT scans, blood tests, and endoscopy/colonoscopy. My main symptom is a severe inflammation pain in my left jaw/neck that periodically moves down my neck along the nerve, into my abdomen, skips around to various organs and then ends up back at my jaw/neck. I have severe anxiety and depression, fatigue, headaches, was diagnosed with OCD, all of which I know is connected to the vagus nerve inflammation/infection. My life has been totally debilitated by this. I also have several herpes sores in my mouth and tongue on the left side. I am on a slew of supplements but the only one that has given me any measurable relief from the pain is called Cytokine Suppress with EGCG by Life Extension. My Naturopath prescribed an antiviral called Valacyclovir for a month, I've been on it for a week but no results yet. I will also be tested for Lyme soon.I have been following the work of Dr VanElzakker recently. He has done extensive research on the connections between Epstein Barr, CFS and the vagus nerve. Anyone dealing with these issues should check out his work, especially this interview he did with Healing Histamine in 2014. I pretty much cried when I read it, it resonated so much! I am sick of having to convince doctors that this is what is happening; Dr VanElzakker's research seems so far ahead of what anyone we have interacted with in the medical field knows. I have reached out to him and we will see if he responds, I will definitely update this if so."

none,"On the Pascal Montero Topic Test:Question:Bazlamit suggests using an interest rate swap instead of interest rate call options. She states, By entering into an interest rate swap in which we receive a floating rate in return for paying a fixed rate of interest, we can hedge against rising interest rates and thus stabilize Viewmont's cash outflows. The swap will also reduce the sensitivity of Viewmont's overall position to changes in interest rates.”Answers:With regard to the use of an interest rate swap, is Bazlamit correct with regard to the type of interest rate swap and the effect on interest sensitivity of the overall position?* A) Type of interest rate swap: YES and Interest Rate Sensitivity: NO* B) Type of interest rate swap: NO and Interest Rate Sensitivity: NO* C) Type of interest rate swap: YES and Interest Rate Sensitivity: YESI put C, Yes and Yes, but the correct answer is A.I thought that a pay fixed swap would reduce overall portfolio duration/sensitivity because, Duration pay fixed swap = duration floating leg - duration fixed leg, and the fixed leg duration will be greater than the duration of the floating leg.CFAI Explanation:Bazlamit is correct with regard to the type of interest rate swap but incorrect with regard to the impact of the swap on the interest rate sensitivity of the overall position. Because Viewmont Corporation has a variable rate loan, entering into an interest rate swap to pay a fixed and receive a variable interest rate would stabilize cash outflows and thus hedge the firm's interest rate risk; however, the swap converts the variable-rate loan to a fixed-rate loan. Because the duration of the fixed-rate loan will exceed the duration of the variable-rate loan, the interest rate sensitivity of the overall position increases."

none,"My understanding of Regulation T is that you can borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of the securities with the remaining balance as cash. If that's the case, why does Interactive Brokers set the initial margin for most securities at 25%? I could then control $4 of equity for every $1 in cash. If i'm not mistaken, that 25% rate applies to positions held overnight too. In my head I would have thought that the maintenance margin would be 25% intraday but you would have to put up 50% by market close. What am I missing here?"

none,"I'm working with a model where I have individuals whose payouts need to be deducted from each other without deducting themselves. This is easy enough to do just by linking the individual rows, but since there's no way to visually tell which people are being included in the ""3rd Party Payout"" row it's easy to make a mistake when the number of individuals gets larger. Because the calculation is circular, I can't just reference a total payout row and deduct the specific participant's payout.I'm looking for a way to manage these deductions without having to trace back through all the rows with every new addition. Perhaps through a set of drop downs or by defining rows. Thanks!!1. Rob     Receipts     less 3rd Party Payouts: $Jill, $Mark         =Payout1.

none,"Hi  Just wondering what's the better way to say ""I love you so much"" with an emphasis on SO – 'mahal na mahal kita' o 'mahal kita sobra'?"
none,"Just been reading a bit on wheat germ oil as a vitamin E supplement, anyone use it? Apparently it might lower triglyceride levels in the blood and may contribute to inflammation(??) so I'm unsure whether the vitamin E benefits are worth the negatives."
none,Gets some clear airtime with no speaking at around 4:07 in [this](https://www.facebook.com/Extreme/videos/975829962769950/?t=247). Shazam was no help so I'm guessing it's a Soundcloud artist that hasn't been picked up yet?
none,"Anyone having trouble selecting text around hyperlinks in the Notes app? When editing notes previously the links used to deactivate, now there's a bubble around each one that activates the link in Safari if you tap anywhere even vaguely close to it. Doing my head in, is there a way to have links be inactive again when editing a note?? Double tapping also no longer selects the word if it's not in the dictionary and the overall text selection mechanics are so clunky and stiff  (>_<)"
none,"A friend just started doing landscape designing and is using Architect 3D, and isn't really loving it. He's looked at VizTerra but it's a bit pricey. Any other decent software out there that's open source (or at least cheapish, or just a once off fee)?"
none,"Hi! Just wondering if anyone grows it, and if you can use the leaves or if it's just the root that's used for the neurochem benefits?

none,Any tips on where to get some decently priced collagen peptides?

I'm halfway through a social science bachelor (behavioural studies major) and want to get a part time job related to my studies but I'm not sure what's available based on my lack of qualification.

none,"I posted the other day asking for help to brush up on statistics (snapped my ankle skateboarding so I've got a few weeks in hospital, and needed some resources to catch up and submit STA10003 Stats assignments).The other unit I'm doing is PSY20001 Theories of Counselling. Does anyone know any good places for crash course lessons or abbv. broad overviews on the different counselling theories? I've got a 2500 word essay due this Mon (20th) and still haven't started cos still in hospital waiting for surgery.Basically I just want to cut down on the time it takes to get through and understand a decent portion of the info out there, to develop a semi-passable essay. Essay details [here](https://imgur.com/a/Uttz0vi)."
none,"What's a verb to describe the action of a sleazy despicable person being a disgusting creep towards someone? I've always used ""lech"" or ""letching"" but apparently that's not quite right?Example: ""Are Americans seriously ignoring the fact that Joe Biden is an actual pedophile, with so much footage and audio of him openly letching onto little girls??""Edit: looking for active rather than passive, so not just leering but also looming, touching, making uncomfortable, invading space etc."
none,"I'm a third year bachelor of psych student, studying online. One of my units this semester is Intro to Statistics, and after 8 weeks into the 12 week course I just opened book and started reading last Friday. Then snapped my ankle skateboarding Saturday night. So now I'm facing a week in hospital (including surgery) + a few weeks recovery time, which is gonna make catching up WAY harder due to pain medication, mobility issues etc etc. I can study from the hospital bed and at home, but does anyone know of a good resource for crash course statistics lessons, and specifically a basic guide to using SPSS? I want to cut down on the time it takes me to get through and understand all the info, basically. (Btw I know I'm an idiot, I shouldn't have been procrastinating, this is 100% my fault.)"
none,"I want to get into downhill mtb but don't wanna spend thousands straight away before I get a taste for it. Would something like this be alright for a starter bike, or are hardtails 100% unsuitable for this sport? https://www.avantiplus.com.au/products/avhmsa711/title/avanti-black-thunder-7-2"
none,"On my desktop Mac if I select a bunch of text and right click, it lets me open a Statistics dialogue box to check word count. Just got a MacBook Air, running the same version OS and same app versions, but the Statistics option‘s missing. How do I fix this?"
none,"What's the song that kicks in at 9:06 in this vid? The heavy bass line, sort of sounds like the bass at the start of Angel by Massive Attack but it's steady instead of wavering. https://www.facebook.com/359313340856160/posts/2005886879532123/"
none,"Ok so I know this isn't a movie or book etc but can anyone help with a language question? What's the word for the plural version of ‘per capita'... like per capita means the amount of something per person, but if I was to say Ireland has the highest number of redheads per ...(group of people)”, what's the word for that?I don't mean a context specific word, like Ireland has the most redheads per ‘country'”, but a more generic term that could be applied to anything (country, company, people group etc). "
none,"I've got limited garden space and I want to plant out some tomato (gross lisse), capsicum, eggplant, and cayenne chilli seedlings. I'm keen to save the seeds when the plants fruit and wanted to know if any of those will cross pollinate and how far spaced I should plant to prevent this. I know capsicum is a definite cross pollinator with chilli so I'm thinking I'll keep them as far apart as possible."
none,What's that web filter where you type in text and it gives you a distressed version? Like it's all grungy and dirty and wrecked. 
none,"Had a really bad experience with a seller (wrong thing delivered, looks nothing like the picture anyway, and then really bad, lazy customer service), so I left a bad review. They've now agreed to give me a refund but asked politely if I could remove the review. Fair enough.

none,"Edit: u/vleesmachine nailed it, and it wasn't even DnB let alone liquid.. https://youtu.be/LLwRLC2AB3MI'm pretty sure it's just called Blue, heard it on a mega mix ages ago and just remembered it, want to download but can't find on Google without knowing artist name. Pretty sure it's liquid but could be wrong. From memory it's got a vaguely eerie, epic build compared to a lot of other lighter brighter liquid DnB. Wouldn't be more than like, 6 years old?"
none,"I bought this strawb plant from a garden shop, about to put it in a planter box but just wondering if it's a good idea to pull off the flowers that've come up, to give it a better chance to fruit later? Or do you just let it fruit whenever it wants? It's mid winter here in Melbourne (Australia) if that helps, temperate climate. Also I read somewhere they need airflow, but I wanted to keep the planter box against a sunny window indoors (because, strawberries right there in my bedroom). Is that a bad idea? Like why do they need airflow?https://preview.redd.it/d9s2cgogx1g11.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0d9e42d3944ccd261be51438d3cc1dd2e3ef4c3"

Slow, punchy synth melody that sort of sounds like it's on a pan flute setting. Song wouldn't be more than 2 or 3 years old. Lyrics are minimal, there's not many more than the ones I've listed, and the chick is singing in a strained, anguished kinda way.Edit: it's less of a pop song, more maybe electro/alternative? The lyrics aren't a full narrative, they kinda come across more as samples."

none,"I'm flying from Melbourne (Tullamarine) to Perth airport, with only carry on luggage. Jetstar carry on allowance is 56 x 36 x 23cm and I just bought a suitcase 65 x 45 x 23cm ... so 9cm wider and taller than allowed. Question is, will I get it past security and onto the plane, being only” that much bigger? I can keep it to 7kg which is the weight allowance. Obviously I'm not talking to Americans here, I'm positive I wouldn't get it past *anyone* at a Murican errrport, but if there's any Aussies who've had experience with this, in Aus airports, let me know! Churr"
none,"My housemate's boyf wants to come to Melbourne on a holiday visa and she's worried he won't get it. He's 26, works full time, and studying a bachelor degree in civil engineering. Any reason for the stress or is it pretty easy to get holiday visa?"
none,"I'm thinking about using sulbutiamine as a replacement for caffeine. I want to find similar substances to caffeine so that I can rotate them around.I have some questions about sulbutiamine, particularly: how much of it is too much?   can you build a tolerance to it? how does it work?lastly, are there any studies of it for its cognitive effects? I'm mainly looking for something to give me energy or improve my reaction speeds/focus"
none,"I'm considering using L theanine and caffeine together. I'm 15 and was wondering if l theanine is addictive or has any other negative effects. My family has a history of addiction so I want to avoid addictive substances if possible. I know caffeine is addictive, but I keep that one in check.Are there any other substances I can take on top of these two that'll help my cognitive abilities that aren't very addictive/expensive? I mean reaction speed, decision making, and mainly focus. Also, are there any special things I should know about taking L theanine? (if I need to take it on an empty stomach or not)"
none,I have an Acer predator helios 2019 model and it has an i7-9750h. Whenever it enters boost it goes to 4gh but when I'm actually gaming it hovers around 3-3.8 (usually around the lower end)Is this normal? My temps are pretty good and around the high 70s for the CPU. The GPU is also at a good temperature (<60) Is there any way I can get the CPU to be at 4gh if not higher at all times?  In jarod's tech's reviews of the laptop his CPU reached 3.9 GHz in gaming and he has the exact same specs as me minus the storage.Is there any way I can get more out of my CPU since it's still at good temperatures? I tried throttle stop and intel XTU but they didn't seem to make a change. It's also possible I didn't use them correctly though.
none,"I recently got an Acer predator helios 300 with an i7 9750h. Whenever I plug it in, the CPU temps jump to 80 degrees. I checked and the processor is going all the way to 4ghz even when I'm not doing a thing. How can I stop it from doing this? I don't want 80 degrees while I'm just browsing chrome lol  I looked at the power plan and the minimum processor usage is at 0%  I read something about a windows updating causing the processor to boost when plugged in which makes sense. if that is the case, how do I prevent it from doing that?"
none,"With new gen laptops and the price cuts in old gen laptops, I was wondering if waiting till a holiday like Memorial Day would be worth it for a big sale. My budget is ~800 and I've already seen some good deals on micro center for 800, so would it be even better on Memorial Day?"

none,"I'm trying to use /bossbar to make a cooldown bar for a specific action in my datapack.I  want this to be compatible with multiplayer, so, if I were to add multiple players to one bossbar (ex./bossbar set minecraft:encumbered players @ s and have multiple players run that command) would they all share the same boss bar or would each player have their own boss bar that changes at a different rate?Also, how would change the values of the bossbar depending on something like a scoreboard score?"
none,"I  was making this mob, where a stray rides a polar bear and attacks the player. I need the polar bear to also be hostile. I tried looking at the data tags, and found that  I could modify the anger time of the mob, but I also need the AngryAt tag to be filled with a player's UUID. I thought about getting the nearest player's UUID, but I'm not sure of a way to insert the player's UUID into the AngryAt tag of the polar bear. Is there anyway I can get the polar bear to always be angry?"
none,"I have an odd question: I want to change some mobs so that only some players are able to damage them. For example, lets say a cow is Lvl 5. I want it so that only other Lvl 5 players or above are able to damage that cow while Lvl 4 and lower are not. Is there anyway to do this? I tried using teams and turning off friendly fire, but that seems to be a player specific thing since I can still kill any mob that is in my team."
none,"I know that you can get custom textures with optifine, but I'm not sure how. I've seen a single youtube video on the subject, but it doesn't have all the information I want and is from 1.14. Does anyone know a wiki page or somewhere where I can get all the information about this?"
none,"I know the attribute follow\_range exists, but that only works for following. Even if you increase it, a mob wont target the player from further, but it will follow the player from a further distance. Anyone have any ideas as to how I can get a mob to get aggro-ed to the player from further?"
none,"Is there anyway I can prevent him from spawning mobs? I want him to only do the gesture with his hands and not summon anything. I was looking at killing vexs and evoker fangs near him, but that would be messy if a regular evoker came nearby, and I'm looking to keep regular evokers alongside custom evoker that don't spawn anything."
none,"Since it won, i don't understand why there are so many people against it. I genuinely want to know why some people voted it and if influencers were involved. I wanted the iceologer to win and think that it's the best mob, but I would like to know why people wanted anything else."
none,"I'm trying ot make a demon model, and I have the body and wings model. When i import the wings into the body model, I end up having to rotate the wings to connect properly to the body. However, when I rotate it, the different parts of the model just break apart. How can I rotate it so that it still stays together?   sorry if this is  a dumb question, I'm pretty new to blockbench."
none,"I'm trying to make an RPG datapack and want to display the stats of the player.I've decided on trying to display them on the sidebar.

none,"I want to detect all skeletons that have a bow equipped. I know about the SelectedItem tag but it seems to not work on creatures other than the player. My goal is to detect all skeletons with a bow and within a certain radius of the player, then replace that bow with a sword. However, if I just use /execute and /replaceitem it replaces the item of the skeleton infinitely whenever it is in range of the player and prevents it from becoming aggressive to the player and attacking the player for some reason. Therefore, I only want it to run the /replace command if the skeleton has a bow."
none,"In the early versions of minecraft there was a food-health hunger system where you gained health instantly if you ate. In the current system, you have saturation and you regenerate hunger. You also lose hunger normally even if you aren't taking damage. I'm trying to make a system where you don't lose hunger when running and only do so when taking damage. So far, this is  what I have:naturalregeneration to falseplayer has the effect saturation until they take damagethis way, a player does not lose hunger when simply running. However, because i'm applying a saturation effect, the player has full saturation. The only way to lose saturation is to heal, but natural regeneration is set to false. So I have a few questions:Is there anyway for me to prevent the player from losing hunger without them gaining the hidden saturation?Is there a way to give a player a specific amount of health instantly?"
none,"I'm trying to stack items beyond the 64 limit. I want it to be 99/100 for a map. I also want to make this a custom recipe. So, if a player puts a stack of 64 steak with a stack of 36 steak in a crafting table, they should get a stack of 100 steak. Is this possible?"
none,"I'm looking to make it so that silent creepers spawn naturally. To do so, I think I need to first locate regular creepers then summon a silent creeper and kill the regular creeper. So, how do I detect a creeper that doesn't have the nbt tag Silent:1? Trying to select an entity with Silent:0 doesn't work.Is there any other way to do this with datapacks? I'm pretty unfamiliar with them."
none,"I'm trying to make an enchantment that summon a lightning bolt on all entities nearby the player. However, I don't want to hit the player who has the enchantment with a lightning bolt. I can't do @ e\[type=!player\] since I wan't this to hurt other players as well. Is there a way?"
none,"I want to detect whether an entity is in a specific location, rather than radius, relative to the player. What I mean is that I want to find an entity at the same y level as the player then run a command based on that."
none,"My goal is to create a headshot system. To do so, I first want to find if the arrow is near the player's head/at the same y level. I'm pretty sure I have to use /execute to do so, but I don't understand the distance selectors so I would like some help in that. How can I execute for an arrow at the same y level (\~ \~2 \~ ) as the player's head?"
none,"I'm looking to make a pair of diamond boots that triple your health, but make you take way more knockback.

When I hover over the item, I do see the stats saying ""+40 health"" and ""-10000 knockback resistance""What am I doing wrong? is there a way I can take more knockback from not only players, but other things like tnt?"
none,"I want to create a chest with a custom loot table, similar to a chest you would  see in minigames like skywars.

none,"I've been stuck at around bronze 3 for some time now, especially since the new act.Now, I've been having a lot of games where I get my rating decreased or increased in a way (that i feel is inaccurate) For example:12-14 where I top score and do everything that is expected of my agent -> rating decreasedThat should be a rating decreased slightly right?13-5 -> rating increasedshouldn't that be a rating increased greatly?13-4 -> rating increasedalso should be a rating increased greatlyam I wrong to assume these changes in rating or does anyone else agree?I feel that my assumptions are correct because that's how my rating has *decreased.* If I ever get a 5-13 match then my rating decreases greatly but it only increases moderately And it's not as if I'm doing poorly in these wins either, I'm usually top scoring in my team or doing the second to best and only behind by a few kills. It seems like I have to get match mvp for my rating to increase greatly or decrease slightly. Am I wrong here, or is the ranking system a bit broken or unfair? Has anyone else been climbing the ladder normally? PS. these are all solo queues if that matters."

none,"Ive been doing duolingo for around 150 days with little effort in each day and I haven't made much progress. I find that the duolingo lessons are just weirdly ordered and teach you unnecessary nouns before important grammar rules and crucial words. I can barely do basic introductions and understand simple speech but I am stuck. I realized duolingo lessons are useless for me so I started going to the stories it had and I can't understand anything Beyond set 2. So, what other learning tools should I start using? do they actually work? And what can I do to get out of this hole I am in?"
none,"I've spent exactly 1066 hours on tf2 and it's probably my second most played game. I started playing since 2017 and I've loved the game since. For the last 6 months to year however, I've spent maybe 66/1066 hours playing the game. Sometimes while scrolling Reddit or YouTube I see tf2 content and get excited to try it. However, when I actually start playing the game I get bored and quickly leave. I still think the game is pretty funny but not that interesting when I actually play it. Could it be because I play mainly Hightower, the map where I've probably spent half of my thousand hours on? What do you guys do to enjoy the game? I understand using meme strays but there's a point where they're completely unviable and impossible to get kills with. So my final thought: am I done with the game?"
none,"I've been trying to make a heavy and  large hovercraft but I'm having a lot of trouble with it drifting. Balancing is a pain because I always end up being too heavy or too light on one side. Has there been some new way to make hovercraft in this game? I haven't played in a while.I've been using the GeoCorp powerlifter hoverpads, should I be using something different?Btw, I know I should probably use wheels since i'm making a heavy tech, but I want to try to make it a hovercraft because I've never made one and I think it'll be pretty cool."

none,"I want to use the /attribute command to reduce the max health of all players and set it to 10. However, this command can only be used to 1 entity at a time and I want to put it in a datapack. I was thinking of using the selector @ r  and doing that many times so that the chances of a player being missed out is practically none. I'm pretty new to datapacks and functions so if there is anything I should know about them that would help me in this please let me know.btw, @ a dosen't work with /attribute since it only works at one entity at a time. @ a means all players and that suggests multiple entities. even if only one player is logged in a world, @ a still wont work with attribute as i've tried."

none,"Alright, I understand everyone likes the new ryzen CPUs. And I also understand that they obliterate intel in terms of multi core performance. But it's better in multi core tasks,no? Isn't gaming performance based on single core performance? https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/compare_cpu-intel_core_i7_9750h-959-vs-amd_ryzen_7_4800h-1146Based on their benchmarks (if cpu monkey is reliable) the 4800h is only better by 7% for single core performance and the i7 9750h can also be undervolted. The intel processor, i7 10875h is also better than the 4800h for single core performance.So here's the question that I have: how special is the 4800h for gaming? So far it dosent seem that great. It is cheaper and slightly better, but seems a bit over-hyped. Anyone know something I don't?"

As am torn between the Canon 16-35 L series f2.8 without IS or f4 version with IS.I would get the Sigma 18-35 but has no IS and autofocus is noisy, which I may use occasionally.However if IS may not really be necessary with my camera and Steadify, I could forgo the quiet autofocus and go with the sigma which some say is slightly sharper, faster, and is cheaper.Any help with this would be hugely appreciated."

I just have a feeling those countries are also kind of a mess if I'm thinking of living somewhere for 40 years+, they're less stable, not as well run, more bureaucracy, worse education (once I have kids.), but maybe my impression is wrong here.Btw, I listed these options because I have good friends in each of these places.I know this is a very personal choice, but if you could provide any insight I would really appreciate it.Thanks!"
none,"I have spent 30 years of my life beating myself up for not being good enough.For watching porn  For not being charismatic enough  For not being smart enough  For not being brave enough  For giving in to temptation  For watching porn  Blaming myself for relationships ending  For procrastinating  For not making progress in meditation  For not meditating often enough  For not eating clean enough  For not being focused enough  For not working hard enough  For not being reliable enough  On and on and onHating myself, feeling like I'm going through life with gritted teeth and constantly tensed muscles trying to make myself be the way I want myself to be......and it hasn't worked.All of these things I beat myself up for are true, I do them all, and beating myself up has gotten me nowhere.Recently I went through a very hard time, break up, business troubles, general existential crisis, I felt like I was going insane, I thought like life wasn't worth the suffering.I fell into a deep depression for months and all of these bad habits got worse, and as they got worse my self-hatred grew.It got to the point where I was going to snap, I couldn't take it anymore, thoughts of ending it all were becoming more and more frequent in my mind.And at some point, I did snap.I don't know how to describe it, but the phrase***""It's not your fault""***Started filling my mind.Over and over and over again.**It's not your fault****It's not your fault****It's not your fault****I am what I am, I was born who I am, my genetics, the circumstances of my life, and my environment molded me.**It's not my fault.And as I started to feel this and believe this the constant tension in my mind and body eased, even went away completely and I felt OK for the first time in a long, long time.Now I am telling it to myself constantlyWhen I feel an urge ***""It's not your fault""***  When I waste time, I tell myself ***""it's not your fault""***  When I indulge in fantasy ***""It's not your fault""***  When I drink too much coffee ***""It's not your fault""***  When I smoke a joint ***""It's not your fault""***  When I procrastinate ***""It's not your fault""***  When I ruminate on past relationships ***""It's not your fault""***  When I don't get my work done ***""It's not your fault""***  When I skip a workout ***""It's not your fault""***  When my mind gets lost during meditation ***""It's not your fault""***  If I were to release (It hasn't happened since I started telling myself this) ***""It's not your fault""***And when I do this I **completely** forgive myself and **completely** accept myself.For the first time in my life, I am accepting myself, for the first time in my life I am starting to love myself, and it feels so nice I could cry.And the funny thing is now that I have stopped trying so hard to be perfect, now that I've stopped beating myself up for not meeting my own standards **my habits have actually all improved**.**But even if they didn't that would be ok**, I would still forgive myself, I would still accept myself completely. I've tried being a harsh master to myself, it didn't work, and even if I could get the results I wanted that way (I couldn't), it wouldn't be worth it.Whatever struggles **you** are facing now, know that **it is not your fault either**, even if it is the result of your own actions.**It's not your fault.**I hope this helps some of you, it feels like it's changed everything for me.P.S. I don't think I made it clear but retention has never been easier and more enjoyable since I started doing this."
none,Nootropics Depot doesn't do it.Can I buy it from anywhere? Or do I need to be extra careful about quality?
none,"This guy Andrew Huberman is a Neuroscience professor at Stanford. He just did podcasts with both Rogan and Tim Ferris, and they were great.One of the interesting things in the Rogan episode was his discussion of Testosterone.He said lots of interesting things about it.But what stood out to me was he was saying the males of most species have to compete for mates, this means we have to engage in risky behaviour and often even fight, sometimes to the death.You have to be crazy to do that, which is where testosterone comes in, he was basically saying that testosterone is what makes us want to engage in those risky behaviours.But **in humans, it also makes engaging in hard and difficult tasks, whether physical or mental, actually enjoyable.**This aligns nicely with a lot of people's experience in this sub.Once you get on a streak, all of those things that felt like an overwhelming, painful effort before......exercise, work, meditation, talking to women, eating healthy......not only start to feel much easier, doing them actually starts to feel enjoyable.He discussed multiple ways to raise your testosterone even higher naturally. One was a supplement called Tongkat Ali, which he said was very very effective.He gave lots of other advice too.Enjoy "

none,"Today is the day. I plan to post regularly to share my experiences and stay accountable.BackgroundThe last few months have been pretty tough, my business is struggling and hanging by a string, I just lost the woman I thought I was going to marry and have kids with and I have become separated from most of my social group and family. I am in my early 30s.  These things sunk me into a deep depression and I found myself indulging more and more in weed and masturbation. I have honestly felt like nothing will ever be good again, that I will never make money again, that I will never find another partner like my ex, that I will never feel happy again.I was fapping and smoking as an escape from the miserable situation I find myself in, and because the feeling was so strong that nothing would ever get better, that it was like Fuck it, why not.  I have worked really really hard on myself for years, making tons of sacrifices in order to achieve my goals and to find myself in the situation I am in now, felt so defeating, like my best is simply not good enough, and I am not capable of changing my situation.I've been in this slump for months. And today is the day I am going to do something about it. I'm a 30-year-old man, no one is coming to save me, if I have any chance of getting anywhere in life I need to make it happen. Smoking weed and jacking off will only make things worse.  No fap is the first step. I have been on streaks before, and once you get a good run going everything else starts to fall into place almost effortlessly. I have to do it, no excuses.Wish me luck "
none,"After initially reading TMI I was very excited.I committed to 40 minutes of meditation each day and stuck to it.However, after 6 months of this, I felt I had made zero progress:* I had not progressed at all in my sits, if anything, my mind felt more distracted during my sits, after 6 months than they did in the beginning, my mind was wondering and away from the breath for longer periods of time, and the frequency with which I noticed had declined.* I felt no noticeable difference outside of my sits, my mood was the same, my mind wandering was the same, my attention span was the same, everything was the same.So I thought to myself what is the point of continuing this? I give up 40 minutes a day, for what feels like nothing.I did ayahuasca recently and was confronted by how much of my life I live on autopilot, basically at the whim of my emotions in the moment, ruled by habits I don't even want, mindlessly flicking through my phone, constantly doing/taking something to stop myself from feeling any mild feeling of anxiety that I experience.I thought I need to meditate again, to gain some space between these feelings that cause these autopilot behaviours and the doing of the behaviour itself. So I can consciously decide if that is something I want to do or not.So I've been doing 30 minutes a day again for a few weeks now, but would like to avoid the same problems I experienced before if that is possible.Could anyone recommend me some resources that might help with the problems I experienced before? BooksBlog postsWhatever.Thanks in advance"

And just before I went back to the breath I thought to myself:I can't wait to catch my mind wandering again, so I can let myself feel that As a result, I spent much, much more time with my attention on my breath and my periods of mind wondering were much, much shorter."
none,"After a long break from meditation, I've gotten back into it, thanks to TMI.Now that i've been doing it for a few weeks again, I am becoming more aware of my ongoing thoughts and habits throughout the day.Unfortunately a lot of this is negative.I have always had a lot of anxiety, but I'm not aware of it most of the time, now that I am meditating again I'm conscious of the anxiety much more often throughout the day.Another thing is bad habits, maybe it's eating bad food, maybe it's watching some nonsense political video on youtube that will just bring noise to my mind, or maybe it's procrastinating on work. Before I would have just have done these things unconsciously without thinking about them.Now, the thought comes up, I think ""oh I probably shouldn't do this"" then I have a little conflict in my head; yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.

none,"I've just found The Mind Illuminated through a post in the Futurology subreddit.I'm about 10% way through the book and thoroughly enjoying it, it has already answered many questions I have had about meditation.I have meditated on and off for years, I have generally stopped in the past because I just didn't feel like I was getting that much out of it.I have followed many of the apps and even gone through periods of meditating 2 hours a day for months (although not in one sitting).The Mind Illuminated has shown me mistakes I was making and made it clear to me that I should focus on one thing and gradually progress through the steps. Whereas before I was doing whatever, some days open awareness, some days focusing on the breath, some days doing a body scan.With all the meditating I have done, I never felt like my attention grew, even when I meditated for months hours a day, my attention would only stay on the object of meditation for very brief moments before wondering.I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this? If so how did you get past it? And I'm hoping the approach of The Mind Illuminated will guide me to the later stages.Edit: Thanks all for your advice, it's all been very helpful. I read further into the book, and today had my best session ever, jumped straight into level 3 which has never happened to me before. Bananas."

none,"HiI also posted this in a quitting drinking sub, I'm not sure if that's a problem?In large part thanks to Jordan Peterson I quit drinking 11 months ago, after 10 years of being the drunkest person at every party I ever went to (not an exaggeration.) It's something I never thought I was going to be able to do and I'm very happy I did it.However..When I was drinking, I was the life of every party, I have a lot of great friends and I made them all through drinking, not a bunch of drunks, but really cool people, my university friends, my business partners etc. Pretty much everyone I'm good friends with now our initial bonding experience together was drinking.My problem is that, now I've quit drinking, a strong level of social anxiety has come back, that I had forgotten I even had. I no longer enjoy almost any social event, whether it's new friends, old friends or even family. I just sit there feeling uncomfortable the entire time, and it's like I don't have access to the part of my brain where the fun and jokes used to come from when I was drinking.

none,"HiI quit drinking 11 months ago, after 10 years of being the drunkest person at ever party I ever went to (not an exaggeration.) It's something I never thought I was going to be able to do and I'm very happy I did it.However..When I was drinking, I was the life of every party, I have a lot of great friends and I made them all through drinking, not a bunch of drunks, but really cool people, my university friends, my business partners etc. Pretty much everyone I'm good friends with now our initial bonding experience together was drinking.My problem is that, now I've quit drinking, a strong level of social anxiety has come back, that I had forgotten I even had. I no longer enjoy almost any social event, whether it's new friends, old friends or even family.

none,"I remember Jordan Peterson talking a few times of people trying to help, but that ""help"" had the opposite effect.The couple of things I can remember are:A small town in Canada where they wanted to reduce suicide, so they put posters up around the city for a suicide help hotline, I think it was, to talk people out of suicide, but the signs constantly reminded people of suicide and the rates went up in the town instead of down.Taking kids who had hard lives and sponsoring them to go on summer camps with rich kids, thinking the act of kindness and being around well-behaved kids would improve their behaviour (I might be getting this a bit wrong, but that was the gist of it). From what I remember there was no positive improvement for the kids that had been sponsored, but there was negative effects on the behaviour of the kids that had pay to go themselves.I guess another example could be communism.Does anyone remember more about the first two I mentioned?

It was consuming all of my thoughts and i was getting nothing done.i relapsed and all those worries went away and i felt chilled again.Have any of you ever experienced this?One thing is i live abroad and i came home for christmas to a boring little village in England, so maybe thats the culprit.but should i have just pushed through anyway?

none,"Hello all. I recently received my Redeemed Neopixel Hero Tier Neopixel lightsaber. The machine work on the hilt is incredible and it feels great in your hands. The Neopixel blade is equally impressive and the sound fonts are on point.However, with all of that being said, the speaker that was put in the bottom of the hilt was not installed properly. When spinning the lightsaber hilt around, you can feel the speaker moving around at the base. The worst part is, when doing simple lightsaber spins, the speaker gets knocked out of place and the sound quality goes from loud crystal clear to staticky utter garbage. When I do the stab motion with the saber, it does knock the speaker back in place and all is well. The sad part is if I want to go out and do some spins with it and cool moves, the speaker gets knocked out of place multiple times and is really not enjoyable to have to stop what you're doing and focus on getting the speaker back to normal.Does anybody have any suggestions here beyond sending in the saber to the company themselves and waiting potentially 10 weeks to receive it again? I have to say I'm extremely disappointed that after spending $616 and waiting 17 weeks, it would have such a big issue like thisThanks for any help"

none,"I am a 4 year+ Phenibut user at doses ranging from 1-6 gpd. It totally changed my life in the beginning and was magical. At my place of employment, I went from being a cashier to a store manager in a short amount of time after starting due to the magic of it all. Then came the withdrawals in the beginning, thinking that lowering my dose by even a single capsule would make a difference...a mistake that too many will make unfortunately. Fast forward I am now at a point in my life where I am in a good place, have a girlfriend of nearly 3 years, and am finally ready to give up the crutch of it all. Phenibut. I have a love/hate relationship with this chemical. It's totally changed my life but has also made me feel extremely ill at other times. It's something that I don't simply want to be a part of anymore. I have utilized the tools” that lie in Phenibut but I'm ready to move on and think again.I have been on Phenibut HCL specifically for so long that the HCL component is a big component in a lot of the withdrawals as well. HCL is hydrochloric acid, it's why that form tastes so repulsive and makes your stomach a different acidity. HCL is sold as a dietary supplement to produce more stomach acid. Phenibut FAA can be a better alternative(slightly more potent/way less acidic/however more expensive)I started my taper in late October from 5.1 gpd for ~2.5 years to 4.1 gpd with 10 mg Baclofen and did so for several weeks. I had ALOT Of Phenibut and LITTLE Baclofen at the time, so decided best to utilize the Phenibut surplus before making the total switch. Lately I am happy to report that I am currently at 3.6 gpd Phenibut with 5 mg Baclofen assistance. Which should equal to 4100 mg Phenibut. I know many will be surprised that I haven't dropped the dose further but the most important thing for me currently is a gradual change. I have been dependent for so long and currently my job, a store manager of a grocery store during a pandemic while managing 27 employees, can be quite stressful to say the least.There are days when I don't feel great, but I know the lessons I've learned from life and Phenibut will guide me out of the dark days. Just a reminder to everyone that you must come to terms with your addiction and decide to make the change, but do it in a way that will be most suitable for you personally. There's no need to cause unnecessary suffering if you don't have to. This chemical requires discipline to be finally stomped out once and for all. You must make the choice to get off, or continue your old ways I am hoping to be 100% Phenibut/Baclofen free by the end of 2021 and will continue my slow, controlled taper and will update my progress for everyone here. We are in this battle together.Thank you all for reading my paragraphs of texts and hope you all have a splendid day "
none,"This is a PSA to everyone tapering currently. Try to space out your doses as much as possible. I have had a 5 gpd habit for a few years now and started tapering and using Baclofen at the end of October. I noticed with my dose logs that I wasn't tapering as fast as I would like and was more using Baclofen in place of the Phenibut.However the last week, I have tried to space out my Phenibut doses as much as possible, ex. One 800 mg capsule every 4 hours or so as opposed to what I used to do, 2 capsules upon waking and a 3rd about 4 hours later. I have been able to drop my daily Phenibut dose by 800 mg this past week just by doing that alone. I am timing it where I take my last Phenibut dose around ~7hours before desired sleep, to not have negative sleep effects. Alcohol is consumed leading up to when the Phenibut kicks in but only about 2-3 drinks per night. It helps. I will update my progress over the next few months. I've been a daily user for about ~5 years with the exception a cold Turkey withdrawal break around 3 years ago at a 4 gpd habit. I managed to be off the Phenibut for 3 months, but was suffering withdrawal even still and went back on. Probably due to my cold Turkey method"
none,Gooday folks!I am planning on doing some research on my upcoming Birthday. My highest dose with this substance has been 100 ugs and it was a quite comfortable experience every time. I also would combine with either cannabis flower or dabs. Looking to push the boundaries a little bit more here with this chemical and planning on experimenting 200 ugs this time around.What are some of your experiences within this dose range of 100-200 ugs ALD-52??Thanks all
none,"So let me start this post off by saying that LSD will most definitely raise your heart rate while you are experiencing effects, however I seem to be noticing a pattern when it comes to hours later when I'm sleeping. I wear a Fitbit charge 2 pretty much all of the time (I know, maybe a little too much EMF sometimes, but I do my best to mitigate), and while I'm asleep my resting heart rate is always in the low 50s, pretty much 7 days a week, EXCEPT for when I dose LSD...I have discovered that the night following a dose of LSD, whether a full trip dose of 100 ugs or various microdose ranges, not only do I get very good deep sleep once I'm able to knock out, my resting heart rate consistently falls below 50 bpm. I MD'd 15 ugs yesterday as an experiment and sure enough, awoke this morning to find my lowest RHR was 48BPM last night. Obviously this is an n=1 scenario but I find it very fascinating considering having a low RHR is a sign of being in good health. Could LSD attenuate stressors that are causing your RHR to be a little higher than it should be? Almost like a mini reset button for stress on biology? Or due to it increasing heart rate during peak states, it has some kind of countering effect? I have also witnessed similar things with my RHR when I have gone on a good outdoor hike and got great exercise.At any rate, it's interesting, and needs to be further researched"

none,"Yesterday I did some research. I had an old vial that was originally prepared with 2 tabs of 1P and 20 grams (mls) of vodka. I didn't have my scale handy but knew what to expect, roughly 8-10 ugs per dropper. Down the hatch with about 5 dropperfuls and continue on with my relaxing day off. Fast forward an hour later, I am listening to the newest JRE with Moxie Marlinspike, and things are getting a little more interesting. I start having these futuristic, black mirror-esque thoughts about the future and how one day education will be 100% tailored to the individual and what that individual wants to learn. I pictured a holographic AI nanny teacher of some sorts for children of the future. After having my futuristic thoughts, I go out in the living room and start to play some mini-putt on VR to test my motor skills and WOW, I'm pretty damn good at mini putt on acid! Somewhere around then my girlfriend and I start talking about WW2 history and the horrific things that generation had to witness and be a part of and how tough they were. We continued to talk about alternate ways the war could have gone, crazy war stories, and just how close the tide could have shifted during it all. Then began discussing current culture and topic issues. I am normally a pretty quiet and chill dude, but at this dosage, I had suddenly become a free flowing sociable professor of sorts and was ALL-IN on this discussion we were having and felt very good talking about it. Long story short, at this dosage of 1P-LSD, I wasn't tripping, but I definitely was having the strange thoughts and intellectual curiosity that were quite enjoyable. It was at a dosage where you could use language quite well to explain a topic and not confusing, like with higher doses"
none,"Yesterday went well with subbing 5 mg Baclofen for the 500 mg Phenibut. I noticed no differences and had no issues sleeping. I may have actually slept better because of the stronger sedative effect. Will repeat this process for a week and then next week will drop the Phenibut dose to 4.1 gpd and sub 10 mg Baclofen.I plan on dropping 500 mg per week and subbing an additional 5 mg Baclofen for every 500 mg drop as the weeks go by. I will keep updating my progress on here.Those who have experience with using Baclofen and this 500 mg per week taper method, is it sustainable and slow enough to mitigate withdrawal effects?Thanks all"
none,"Hello everyone!I have been taking 5.1 grams of Phenibut daily for quite some time now, coming at about a year of daily dosage of that level and before that, roughly 2 years of 2-3 gpd.I have Baclofen and today cut my dose of Phenibut down to 4.6 grams and took a 5 mg Baclofen to compensate for the -500 mg of Phenibut based on my research.I have been too dependent on Phenibut these past years and I've learned a lot from my experiences and it's time to make the move to get off the stuff. I still have roughly 700 grams of Phenibut to gradually taper off and have a good supply of Baclofen to assist me in getting off.This will be a gradual long taper to minimize withdrawals and assume I'll be tapering/subbing Baclofen for roughly the next 20 weeks.I will continue to update my results in this subreddit.Thanks for any support, tips, in advance.Have a good day folks"

none,"So we know that agonists down-regulate, does this mean that antagonists would upregulate? I was thinking of this the other day while under the influence of a particular lysergamide.Kratom is a 5ht2a antagonist and psychedelics are 5ht2a agonists. Theoretically wouldn't long term Kratom use, in the absence of psychedelics, upregulate 5ht2a receptors, thus making psychedelics more potent whenever ingested? And in turn, wouldn't Kratom use reset tolerance to psychedelics sooner, due to upregulating 5ht2a receptors?Just trying to understand the chemistry moreEDIT: To be clear, my goal is not to potentiate psychedelics or intentionally upregulate 5ht2a. I am merely just trying to theorize what 5ht2a effects that Kratom and psychedelics would have together, given that one is an agonist and the other is an antagonist. It seems a strange receptor in and of itself and maybe not enough science to really show what might be happening"
none,"Greetings folks!Just another report of 100 ugs of this compound.My second experience at 100 ug was just like the first time, with effects starting at about 2 hours after ingestion and peak effects hitting 3.5 hours in with comedown starting about 6.5 hours in. This compound is very clean and feels identical to good ol LSD-25, with the exception of the longer come up, peak, overall effects. I spent the majority of the day working out on a vibrating platform and lifting weights, and playing VR. It was a good time. I once again became the music and felt myself grooving along to some badass old school funk. I had minor visual distortions for about an hour during the peak, but more body and head than anything You can really get on the same vibe level of bands in the 70s groovin it and dancing. Such an amazing experience. Who would have thought that such a tiny amount of a compound could have such a profound effect!Thanks for reading my short report and will write up another 2 weeks from now.

Also the carpet in class would look extra staticky and if we would stare at it it would almost appear as the carpet would rise”. It was quite terrifying actually and we were convinced it may remain with us throughout our lives.Me being the nerdy researcher I am, I read about ways to help HPPD. The first one I stumbled upon was taking 5-HTP DAILY at a dose of 100-200 mg ED for a few months. I figured 5-HTP is cheap as hell and good for serotonin pathways anyways so it was worth a shot. Sure enough my friends and I after taking 5-HTP daily for a few months were 100% cured of our HPPD and it has been years since any of us has had any symptoms whatsoever.So to those suffering with HPPD, I would highly recommend taking 5-HTP daily and seeing if it gives you relief. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps anybody struggling with it "
none,"I have never tried Viagra, Cialis, or any of the dick pills that are advertised so heavily and so embedded in the culture but sweet baby Jesus...how many of you fellow microdosers have noticed an aphrodisiac effect? This post is out of sheer scientific curiosity because there is no supplement, no pill, as far as I'm concerned that can rival the sexual power of a microdose of LSD. Not only do I stay hard seemingly forever, my energy and sex drive is through the roof. On top of this I find it very challenging to cum which is great for my partner and I. We can basically just please the absolute fuck out of ourselves until we achieve an ungodly orgasm.I'm honestly surprised that microdosing for sex is not promoted more on the internet. It IS the ultimate sex life enhancer"
none,"A few months ago I embarked on a full trip dose of 4-AcO-DMT in the range of about 19-21 mg of fumarate in the form of powder in a gel capsule. My previous experiences with this compound were microdoses from 2-5 mg and a few light trips at 10-15 mg. I really wanted to see what this compound had to offer.I ingested the ~21 mg of 4-AcO DMT by myself home alone with my dog and 3 cats, and approximately 20 mins later started to feel the beginnings of a perspective shift. I decided to take a shower to cleanse my old self” and get into comfortable clothing. About 10 minutes into my shower the effects began to intensify and showering and washing myself felt quite strange and very ape” like. I kept imagining the orangutan in the planet of the apes hanging upside down and rubbing rose pedals on his armpits. I felt not so distant from our monkey ancestors. It was around this time that a great deal of bodyload began to set in and I finished up my shower, got on clean clothes, headed upstairs and proceeded to lie down on my rug and play some 60-70s music. Santana, Beatles, The Doors, etc. The music began to slowly creep me up and up until my everyday thoughts started to become very altered.I decided to watch Jurassic World 3D around this time, about 50 minutes after ingesting the compound. It was an epic introduction and I knew I would be sucked into the world of dinosaurs. I noticed the behavior of the actors more so than ever before in this state of mind. The actors were doing such a great job in their roles that all of their portrayed feelings seemed 100% real and truthful. Every scene that had a deeper emotional root to it seemed to strike right at my heart and the emotional part of my brain. I would get teary-eyed at the slightest of emotional scenes because I could feel for what the characters in the movie were really feeling.During this time I did begin to experience some pretty severe possible vasoconstriction” in my right leg which I think I might have varicose veins in already. It was bad enough to the point that I decided to take 150 mg of high quality expensive CBD in an effort to help with pain, inflammation, etc. It took around 20-30 mins or so for it to work but eventually the significant pressure started to decrease. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This part of the trip cannot be overlooked as I have experienced this type of leg pain with other psychedelics as well but more so with 1P-LSD than with ALD-52 and more so with 4-AcO-DMT than with psilocybe mushrooms. I now believe that these chemicals do have STRONG vasoconstrictive effects because they really do make my varicose veins feel 5X worse than they normally do. Just a precaution for people with impaired vein health.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Moving on with the trip, I realized that the emotional component of my brain and soul was fully activated like never before. Visually there really weren't a whole lot of changes surprisingly but emotionally, these effects were on level with a 5+gram trip of mushrooms but different at the same time. I've never done DMT but I imagine that this compound is more similar to an oral DMT than it is to psilocin. I have done mushrooms more times than I can count on fingers and toes and this compound, on the contrary to what a lot of people say, is NOT the same thing as mushrooms and in fact, far from. The only thing that felt similar to mushrooms was the body high that I was having.At around 3-4 hours after ingestion I had to seek out and find my animals and bond with them and speak with them. I felt the strongest feeling of love I have ever felt in my life when I was connecting with each animal. I was seeing the memories we have shared of each animals life and was radiating pure love and appreciation of these animals in my life. I brought myself to a waterfall of tears with every encounter with my animals. It was unbelievably beautiful. For me this was a night and day difference, as I am normally one not to share and express my emotions too well. It felt as if the tall dam in my body holding back 95% of my emotions, came crashing down and tsunamis of emotions were free to flow throughout every cell in my body. The powerful emotions were on par with a 100 mg dose of quality MDMA but different in its own special way. All in all, this chemical to me is what I would call powdered emotions” as I find it is the best tool I have ever came across for accessing the deep emotions that I hold near and dear in my body that I don't always express. This experience was one hell of an emotional waterfall and to date remains to be one of my most positive life changing psychedelic experiences, out of the 100 or so that I have ever had. I still look back on this trip almost on a daily basis to remind me of how short life is and how we must truly express love to the ones that we care about most in our lives. Of course everyone reacts differently to everything but for me this compound, as I told myself repeatedly during the trip, is pure emotions, love, and gratitude. This was very different and more powerful than the chemical shrooms” comparison that is talked about so often, but nonetheless a fantastic experience. Thank you for reading my powerful experience and safe journeys to all of my psychonaut friends out there  TLDR: I was hoping for a visually entertaining, mildly emotion intensifying trip, but instead experienced a powerful emotional waterfall with long lasting positive effects. 4-AcO-DMT is nothing close to shrooms but a whole other ballpark of effects."
none,Does anybody else get extremely horny when microdosing LSD? I've found all aspects of sex to be significantly enhanced while under the influence of a microdose. It straight up turns me into an animal. I'm thinking further research into the aphrodisiac effects of LSD could make it the future of sexual enhancement if it ever gets legalized.Wondering if anyone else feels this effect...
none,"Hello reddit microdosing community I just wanted to give a shoutout and update to my ALD-52 microdose regimen that I've been utilizing.This stuff is GREAT. I've found my sweet spot to be around 15 ug, with the low range for me being 10-14 ug and the high range sitting at 16-18 ug. I work 5 days a week and tend to microdose only on my days off of work. Sometimes I only microdose on one of the off days but usually it's 2 consecutive days in a row. I notice only the slightest tolerance from consecutive dosing. I find that if I take 15 ug one day, then I need about 16-17 ug the next day to get those same effects.My volumetric dosing protocol involves weighing out 10 grams of 80 proof vodka in a tincture bottle before dropping in a 100 ug tab of ALD-52. I then shake for a full minute to speed the release of the ALD-52 into the vodka. For best results I allow the tab to soak for a full 24 hours before using from that bottle. This probably isn't totally necessary but I do it to make sure the dosage is as accurate as possible. As a side note, one thing I have heard about in the community is that ALD-52 degrades into LSD-25 the longer it sits suspended in vodka. The vodka is 80 proof, thus 40% alcohol with the rest being water. I have found the effects of the ALD to be noticeably smoother the longer I have that tab soaking in the bottle. This could be placebo, but I highly doubt it, because at this point, I have around 50 experiences with microdosing this compound and I can say for a fact that something is chemically different about the overall experience. Cleaner effects would be the best way to describe the experience. Very much more of an LSD-25 vibe to it and less of an extended release” acid vibe.The effects are reliable at my sweet spot of 15 ug and result in me becoming a much more cognitively aware, kind, compassionate, and energetic human being. If I were asked the question of What does microdosing feel like?”, I would respond with a simple yet beautiful answer... It just feels like a really good day.Thanks for reading my experience friends and stay safe out there <3"
none,"Good day everyone  I have around 500 mg of this compound and have used several times but never going above 15 mg. At that dose it was contained and fun but looking to experiment with 20 mg+. Please chime in, thanks in advance for posting your experiences"

none,"Hello friends, I would love to share my experience with microdosing ALD-52, seeing as 1P is the more microdosed one.Well I have to say that I really prefer this chemical over 1P perhaps because of its slower onset and longer duration. I have only microdosed in the range of 6-14 ug, so I can not compare it with macrodoses of 1P.I know there is constant debate about the differences of 1P-LSD and ALD-52 on how they are pretty indistinguishable, and I can agree with that statement except for the fact that it does seem to come on a little slower and last a little longer. Maybe the Acetyl bond is more slowly metabolized vs the propionyl chain, thus having that effect.I am a daily Kratom user so all of my microdoses are consumed with about 7 gs of Kratom in my body from 2 morning doses a few hours before microdosing. I also microdose only on my days off of work and consecutively 2 days in a row. I usually notice minor if any tolerance from this routine. I.e. 14 ug one day and 14 ug the next day it generally feels ~ or -1 ug.I notice very positive effects from microdosing in the range of 10-14 ug, which include energy enhancement, increasing motivation, mood, focus, memory, sensory enhancement, and appreciation of life. I almost always take it before going on a hike in nature and find that I feel much more aware of my self and surroundings.This is a truly beautiful chemical and must be treated with respect and proper research. I would highly recommend it for fellow microdosers.Thank you for reading, much love to you all <3"
none,"Hello friends, I wanted to share my experience with microdosing a fresh Psilocybin mushroom, since I couldn't find any reports really.I had read that fresh vs dry dose is about 10:1 so I opted for a 1.3 g fresh mushroom. That means this would correlate to .13 g dried, which I've read is in the microdose ballpark. It was a beautifully elegant small one with a picturesque cap and stem.I ate the mushroom and washed it down with my Bulletproof coffee. It had a great taste and reminded me of a good oyster mushroom. At around an hour later I started experiencing minor effects kick in and by the 2 hour mark is where it was at its maximum force. I was out on a nice mountain hike and just felt very in tune with nature and grateful that I could be so close to this beautiful place. All in all it was a microdose experiment so had microdose effects, ie. slight appreciation of music, balanced mood, slightly more drive, increased wonder. It was nothing short of what I was hoping it would be.To anybody that has fresh and Is interested in microdosing, I would highly recommend a similar dosage. Thanks for reading, everybody <3"
none,"Hi all, today I will be repeating an experiment I did 2 weeks ago. My goal is to maximize as much as possible the brain benefits of microdosing 1P-LSD.My previous stack consisted of 8 ug 1P-LSD, 1000 mg Agmatine Sulfate, New Chapter Once Daily Multi, 6 caps of Magtein (Magnesium L-Threonate), 200 mg Ubiquinol, 20 mg PQQ, 200 mg Resveratrol, 6 Krill Oil Sofgels (3000 mg), 5 DHA capsules (~3200 mg O3), 240 mg Chinese Pine Bark, 1000 mg Green Tea Ext, 20 mg Lutein, 4 mg Zeaxanthin, 200 mg NeuroFactor (Coffee Fruit Ext.), 1200 mg Neurophenol(Patented Polyphenol blend), 900 mg Polyphenomenol(Polyphenol blend), 800 mg Longvida Curcumin, 12 mg Astaxanthin, 100 mg Chlorophyll, 1500 mg Goji Berry Ext., 2000 mg Org Lions Mane, Reishi, Chaga, Poria blend, Turmeric & Ginger Ext blend, and lastly 2000 mg of Pau D Arco Inner Bark Capsules.I know that was a lot of stuff to read and I apologize haha wish there was an easier way to list it. Anyways, I'm a daily Kratom user and consume about 8-10 gs throughout the day. This stack will be taken with roughly 4-5 gs of Kratom spread throughout a few morning hours. The other 4-5 gs of Kratom will be taken throughout the hike. I find that it really enhances the experience.Just like the time before, I am going on a pretty strenuous but beautiful local hike and my goal is to promote neuroplasticity and neurogenesis as much as humanly possible. I will be engaging in meditation, HIIT exercise, tree climbing, push-ups, deep breathing, podcast listening, and lastly music listening. The last time I did this experiment I felt absolutely amazing and my brain felt like it was functioning better than I have ever experienced in my life. There were no words to quite explain the feeling of my mind actually expanding and basically feeling my brain becoming more fluid and neuroplastic. Things were just really clicking for me and felt really in tune with life.Wish me luck that this will be repeated once again today  Thank you for reading friends <3     Many blessings on your next adventures"
none,"Hi all, I just wanted to share my amazing microdosing experience yesterday with 1P-LSD. I have microdosed a total of 5 times and my first two microdoses were 4 ug, which were good experiences but didn't fully deliver what I was looking for. The second two microdoses were at 6 ug and had definite positive activity for me. (Positive headspace, enhanced focus, motivation, uplift in mood, decrease in anxiety)I hadn't microdosed in 9 days prior to yesterday's experience and wanted to push the dose a little bit higher as I had planned for a solo day full of local hiking, music, podcasts, and possible reading of a great book I started recently. (How To Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan)The weather was supposed to be rainy and foggy and a bit cooler than it has been in the past month or so. (low 60s compared to high 80s) I am somebody that very much enjoys long hikes in the rainy, misty, foggy weather because it makes me feel more alive with the earth generally and it just has a cool vibe with it. I began my morning ritual as usual with Bulletproof coffee and 2 doses of 2.5 g of a White MD and Yellow Vietnam spread out by about 2 hours. (daily Kratom user) I'm also very into brain enhancing supplements and thought it would be a good idea to also take with me a stack of various BDNF, NGF, and Neuroplastic increasing supplements. These are Magnesium Threonate, Neurofactor Coffee Fruit, (both of which I took double doses of) PQQ, CoQ10, Longvida Curcumin, Astaxanthin, Krill Oil, and Lutein&Zeaxanthin, just to name the power players.I then volumetrically microdosed 8 ug and then left the house to drive to my favorite hiking park, about a 10 minute drive. I first began to feel the effects manifest about 40 mins after the microdose but knew that it was going to escalate. Roughly an hour after the microdose I noticed my headspace change into a much more aware, happy, and grateful one. I couldn't help myself but express pure love and gratefulness to be alive and be able to hike this beautiful trail on such a perfectly cool day in nature. I felt truly blessed that we being Coloradoans, can have these amazing hikes literally right outside of our front door.I spent the next 6 hours meditating, doing stretches, balancing exercises, climbing trees, sprinting, rock climbing, and just enjoying being in the moment with everything and taking it all in. There was a funny moment where I was people watching from a rock overlook just meditating calmly and doing deep breathing, where I would try to guess which car belonged to the hikers or bikers just based on their stature and how they carried themselves. I was correct 3 out of the 3 people/groups that I did that with. I found that very interesting, because my senses were so heightened.All in all it was a fantastic experience and I had so much energy throughout the hike and truly felt like my mind was expanding and becoming neuroplastic through the combination of the microdose, intense exercise, meditation, ketosis, and all of the said brain supplements. Also at no given point did I feel too out of touch with anything, in a sense that I cognitively and behaviorally functioned 100% normal if not 110%. Basically, nobody would have known that I had been under the influence of LSD.10/10 would repeat this experience and would highly recommend to anybody who has close access to beautiful trails. THANKS FOR READING FRIENDS <3 HAPPY TRAILS"
none,"I have taken Lions Mane mushroom off and on for quite a few years (first took when I was 17 and now I'm 22) and one peculiar effect that I reliably get is very vivid dreams. Anybody else have this experience? I get this effect from mycelium extracts (Host Defense) as well as from fruiting body extracts (Gaia Herbs, New Chapter, Nammex Mushrooms (ND) )I take it maybe 3-4 days a week as of lately but every time I take it I remember my dreams more than I otherwise would. Pretty awesome effect for those people that like to have vivid dreams out there.As a side note I have taken Bacopa (Himalayan Herbal Healthcare) along side Lions Mane tincture (Host Defense) and it significantly raises the occurrence of lucid dreaming. Very interesting brain effects from these foods.Thanks for reading <3 have a great day folks "
none,Can I get some feedback from people who have microdosed with 1P-LSD?? I have MD'd twice now at only 4 ug and the first time was great and super subtle but the second time I felt a bit of anxiety and jitters.(I was at work however) For my next microdose I was thinking of maybe upping to 8 ug. What are people's sweet spot with this stuff? Thanks for reading friends <3 feedback is much appreciated.

none,"I recently did my first microdose of 1P-LSD (4 ug) and it was an awesome experience but what I found more amazing than the experience itself was the 48 hour afterglow effect. Does anybody else notice this strong afterglow from such a small dose? It was interesting that the afterglow did seem to wear off at exactly the 48 hour mark from dosing which I also found to be very interesting. The positives of the microdose afterglow were not far off from a full blown trip afterglow. Any other experiences out there? Thanks for reading friends, many blessings <3"
none,"Today I will begin my first successful (hopefully) microdose experiment with 1P-LSD acquired from an online vendor. I have extensive use with psychedelic substances such as LSD, DOB, 2C-E, and Mushrooms. I would say I have probably around 30-40 experiences total. Around 5-7 of those experiences were very intense ego-death experiences with powerful mind altering effects. I tried microdosing LSD before work a few years ago but that was when I wasn't aware of volumetric dosing (via 10 mls of water per 100 ug tab) and the experience was rather intense as I assume I ingested around ~20 ug. (cut a small square, silly me) Needless to say, I don't want a repeat of that experience haha.I have decided on a dose of 5 ug to start as I have never taken 1P-LSD (or at least not intentionally) taken through a dropper that I have dosed accurately with a scale. 10 gs (10 ml) of distilled water and a 100 ug blotter. Based upon what I've researched I have found a range of 4-15 ug to be optimal for most people, hence why I am starting on the low end of the spectrum. The setting will be at a casino town and the activity of the day/night will be gambling. I'm not a big gambler but I do enjoy it every few months or so. I want to explore the possible benefits of a microdose in this setting based upon a reference from an episode of the MAPS podcast where James Fadiman mentions a generous donor who has used microdosing in his profession of gambling with great success. Wish me luck fellow friends, I will report back tomorrow with the full experience in detail. Many blessings <3"
none,"Hi all, just wanted to share my latest stack for energy/mitochondrial health. I always start my morning with Bulletproof Coffee with tons of fat, as this is a great delivery vehicle for my supplements.My stack consists of 400 mg Nicotinamide Riboside(Niagen), 200 mg Coq10, 1500 mg D-Ribose, 1500 mg Kre-Alkalyn Creatine, 8 mg Astaxanthin, 500 mg Krill Oil, 2 caps of MagMind (Magnesium Threonate), and lastly to top it all off, half a dropper of Herb Pharm Rhodiola Extract.Mind you this was consumed with my usual cup of coffee, but my energy/focus seems very much heightened and for lack of a better explanation, my mitochondria feel as they are singing.It can be quite an expensive stack when you consider the Niagen, MagMind, Astaxanthin in particular but I highly recommend that mitochondriacs give it a shot. The Niagen, D-Ribose, and Creatine seemed to produce pretty immediate effects when combined.Also in the name of science I popped a 200 mg Sulbutiamine cap to see where the days energy levels can go. Thanks for reading, friends. Stay Nooted"
none,"Hi all, I thought I would share a stack I've been experimenting with for a strong motivation and mood boost.As an introduction, I struggle with anxiety and depression and sometimes it is severe enough to keep me from leaving my house. Everyone's physiology and neurochemistry varies so your results will not necessarily mimic mine.Now on to the stack, it primarily consists of Zembrin (Kanna Extract), Kratom (preferably white vein), Phenibut (preferably FAA), and Tianeptine (preferably Sulfate).I start the morning by taking Agmatine Sulfate (1600 mg) on an empty stomach and 30 mins later L-phenylalanine (1000-2000 mg). This is important to space out the amino acids as they will compete with absorption. Then I will usually proceed with a super fatty bulletproof coffee (~200 mg caffeine, 80-100 gs of fat). I consume this throughout the first half of my day.Around an hour after the amino acids I will then take 2.3 gs of a white vein Kratom. (I find Maeng Da works best). Usually an hour after that I will pop a 25 mg Tianeptine Sulfate capsule and around 850 mg of Phenibut FAA. I let some time past, probably 1-2 hours and then take another 2 gs of Kratom, 500 mg Phenibut FAA, 25 mg Tianeptine Sulfate, and around 75-100 mg Zembrin Kanna Extract. What proceeds for the next several hours are effects that are very energetic, (yet calm at the same time), mood boosting, anxiolytic, and motivation-enhancing.Now I realize this is a lot of substances at once but it has worked really well for my own neurochemistry. I don't feel high or f***ed up from this, just feels like how life should be. I am more creative, empathetic, energized, and just overall a better person.I would liken it almost to the effects of microdosing psychedelics such as LSD or Psilocybin Mushrooms. It is also important to note that I don't have a come down or any negative side effects and actually have an afterglow the next day as well. It kind of just makes you feel more alive and very present in the moment. Unfortunately for the issue of tolerance and withdrawals, it is probably wise to keep it at 2 days a week or less in order to maintain the magic of the stack.Please note again that I am a n=1 experiment and YMMV, but thank you for reading my experience, and good luck on any of your nootropic adventures.Also other supplements I take that probably add to the effects...Magnesium L Threonate, CoffeeFruit Ext, Astaxanthin, B-vitamins from organic food, PQQ, COQ10, Phyllanthus, Uridine Monophosphate, Longvida Curcumin, Omega 3s, Glutathione, and NAC"
none,"Hi all, I just wanted to share with you what a great base noot Agmatine can be. I have been taking it pretty much every day over the last 2 months with maybe 5 days off at a dose of roughly 1600 mg on an empty stomach in the morning right after waking up. This is important as dietary protein will compete with the absorption pathways. I have noticed that on its own it has somewhat of a mood balancing effect due to it acting as a neuromodulator and NMDA antagonist. When taken with other classical nootropics, such as Phenylpiracetam, Semax, Adrafinil, Fasoracetam, Phenibut, Tianeptine, Kratom(IME) and honestly even the more mild ones like Uridine, Alpha GPC, Fish Oil,etc. It seems to not only modulate the effects and potentiate mildly, but also reduce tolerance build up for the ones that can produce tolerance. I realize this is the reason people will take much more powerful NDMA antagonists in a desperate effort to reduce the tolerance to whatever drug they are taking, but Agmatine is a really good alternative in my opinion. It does take some time to really build up the effect, I would say prob 2-3 weeks of daily dosing for me (1600 mg daily) before realizing wow this is seemingly bringing the magic back of noots and I don't gain tolerance to things as easy as I did before. Not to mention, the Nitric Oxide effect does feel quite nice at times when you are doing endurance type or HIIT workouts.Just my two cents and YMMV, but thank you for reading my experience. Good luck on your nootropic ventures"
none,"Just wanted to share my experience with this amazing stack. I work as the manager of a supplements department in a health food store so I have access to and take many, many supplements. This morning I took 600 mg Adrafinil on an empty stomach along with my usual 1600 mg Agmatine Sulfate and 4 pumps of NA Semax (400 ug). I then had some bulletproof coffee and proceeded with taking part of my usual stack, Magnesium Threonate (3 caps), 300 mg Alpha GPC, 250 mg Uridine MP, Omega Curcumin, Organic Multi, Siliphos Milk Thistle Ext, Astaxanthin (10 mg), CoffeeFruit Ext. (100 mg) which also contains Cognivia, a patented Sage extract for cognition, and popped 100 mg Phenylpiracetam capsule. What manifested over the course of the next few hours, was a steady rise in not only my wakefulness, energy, motivation, focus, but also a mood boost. I would rate this stack as one of my top 3 personal favorites, it really does kick your ass in gear and put you in the zone, but without any druggy or wired, jittery feelings. It really just feels like your brain is truly on its game and fully awake and present in the moment. I would highly recommend this combo to those who need to get things done in a timely manner without being distracted. No side effects were noted from this stack of supps.

none,"I just thought I would post my experience with this since there seems to be a lot of anxiety and paranoia surrounding the stack because of anecdotal reports of seizure like effects when combining. This morning I took 1600 mg Agmatine, 600 mg Adrafinil, 100 mg Phenylpiracetam, 250 mg Uridine, 300 mg Alpha GPC, roughly 15-20 mg of Zembrin Extract, along with my usual bulletproof coffee. I didn't take my usual morning Kratom dose and actually waited to take my first dose roughly 5-6 hours after dosing the Adrafinil because I wanted to be safe. I noticed no side effects whatsoever and possibly even a lessening of the euphoric effects of Kratom. I have seen reports of potentiation, but in my subjective experience, did not experience this. As a side note, both Kratom and Adrafinil are a2 adrenergic agonists, which might explain possible synergy for some folks. Agmatine is supposed to modulate a2 adrenergic receptors so it's possible that it counteracted any kind of synergy from the two. I am an n=1 experiment, but for what it's worth, I noticed no side effects from stacking Kratom and Adrafinil. Thanks for reading my report"

none,"For the last month I have been taking this stack every morning and have noticed very consistent results. It reliably puts me into a focused and calm state with the added benefit of a mild mood boost. I take 250 mg of Uridine (Jarrow Formulas) and 300 mg of Alpha GPC (NOW).I have struggled in the past with mood swings, anxiety, depression, as well as memory problems, and this stack has pretty much resolved all of those symptoms. I have tried a ton of nootropics in the past 6 years (probably totaling near $1000) and this stack always gives me reliable results.I find that if I dose anymore than one capsule of each I get signs of excessive choline and/or dopamine. I highly recommend this as a beginner stack for somebody looking to really explore what nootropics can do for your brain 🧠 I am new to the community but look forward to posting about various topics and giving whatever insight I can from my years of nootropic use. Thank you for reading"
none,"The other day i was working on a room addition I'm building onto my home and I had to dig a hole, pour concrete, lay out the rebar everything all in one day. As you can tell this is a lot of work. In the morning I took  200mg caffeine pill and 400 mg l theanine. This Is what I usually always do but once it wears off you dont feel the effects anymore. Well that day I decided since I have so much to do I'm gonna do a second dose of caffeine and l theanine except a half dose so for the second time (only after first dose wore off) I did 100 mg caffeine which is half a caffeine pill and then 200 mg l theanine and it worked! It's so much better to do a second dose I never considered it but you can get way more focus and energy out of your day and out of yourself if you do a second dose just half the size the first one. Caffeine and l theanine but instead longer lasting and it was awesome.  I should have been doing it this way in the first place. Before it would wear off and I would just let it instead of taking more."
none,"First off its bullshit.  They nerfed the war machine shock RC and everything. I expected Tunisia to be a REAL map you can play team deathmatch on but apparently not it's just a little BS map like saloon. Those maps only for certain game modes. And now the ""recommended friends"" is all up in my screen when I dont even have these people added they still pop up random people to invite to my game when none of my friends are online. I know this seems like a negative review but my experience with this update was that it's not really a good update. It actually makes the game worse and under delivers. And the calling cards are unneccessary as well. Look closer they nerfed a lot of weapons and score streaks that you might use in your load out. **What's your guys opinion on season 7?**"
none,"If i want to increase the power capacity in my house to 200 amps would I have to buy a 200 amp meter pan, a 200 amp breaker, or both? I need to hook up my house to the county/parish I live in.

none,"So the past 10 months i been building an addition to my trailer and it's been one big learning curve being this is the first time I did construction on this scale. My original goal was to build this trailer into a 1 bed 1 bath so I can rent it out for $500 - $600 a month in my local area. Well anyways my DREAM is to work for myself and have passive income so I dedicated my life to improving and acquiring trailers and multiple properties that I can rent out to bring in an income that is controlled by me. The **BIGGEST** thing I learned from this is that the best use of money is to PAY OTHER PEOPLE TO HELP YOU FOR CHEAP. pay friends and family who don't have work pay them $10, $15, $20 to help you achieve your dream. In my case since this is construction type work I can do this. I can't say all dreams but the main thing is to get other peoples TIME ATTENTION and ENERGY on your dream as much as you possibly can to make it come true faster. TLDR; Be focused and write out your goals and utilize other people's time attention and money as much as possible to make your dreams a reality. Impose your dream upon the world and influence others to help you build that dream."
none,I been watching jumbo and other pro players shoot mass into their bigger parts say like if they are split into 6 different blobs. And they make one of them bigger when a opponent comes by ejecting mass into that particular piece to fend off the opponent. I've been trying to do this but I always end up shooting the mass out and cant seem to make just ONE PIECE bigger. Can someone please explain how you do this? Any answer to this is appreciated thank you!! (I'm desperate to learn this lol)

none,"Hey guys this is not a harm post or saying lsd is bad or anything. I just would like to do what I can as my own person to warn others about what they ARE getting themselves into when they take the drug.If you have plans or need sleep then don't take it. Be careful because you might vomit. At first you might want the ""thrill"" and ""fun"" of doing lsd but make sure you are fully committed to what's ahead of you. This is not something to do on the fly like I did. Understand that you may experience rapid heart rate, not being able to sleep, and strange delirious thoughts. (Now if you WANT to do this Then that's you, but I just ask you at least consider the dangers/risks to your health). This is not a drug to be taken lightly. Please give this SERIOUS thought whoever is reading this. Don't do anything youre not ready for. That is all."
none,"Ok so many of you may have heard of amazon and its potential for you to create a great passive income stream, more specifically kindle publishing. Kindle publishing is basically where you either write or pay someone to write a book for you (outsource method) and publishing it up on amazon. Now many people have read or seen about this opportunity on amazon but might not be getting the results they want. As with anything, there is an exact science behind what makes a book launch well (and generate passive income for you!) and what makes a book fail. After 2 years of writing 2 of my own books, hiring people to write books, taking 3 different courses and reading 3 different books on this topic I finally feel like I have mastered this or at least got something right!My story:My first book took me a year to write and $45 to produce. That book made about $100 which isnt bad since i marketed it on facebook to my family. (hey you got to start somewhere). But taking a year to make a $50 profit is not what I was looking for. Next book I had published was one I hired someone from jamaica to write for $150. That book failed miserably. (keep in mind that even though these books didn't do great, they were learning experiences for the process that I would later master!) My third book took me 5 DAYS to write. Simply because I wrote a book before and knew what to expect, read a book on formatting, and took a course called 24 hour book. That book failed miserably too because the market I was going into was only selling because of outside traffic on anothers publishers website. So after these failures of book i finally figured its time to invest in a course. (actually I invested in the course before the 3rd book but didn't get it right completely) I hired a coach and he told me what I was doing wrong. I even ordered his book and the book and the coaching I believe is where I started to see success. So, here comes my fourth book. I followed what my coach told me and followed the book to a T. I utilized all the skills and knowledge I had from my last books and put them into action using the new formula i learned. Not only that, I was learning things on the side that could boost my books even MORE. I wrote everything I learned into a step by step plan and executed every single step and low and behold I produced a book that now makes $350-$400 a month PASSIVE income and is a BEST SELLER on amazon! And the cool thing is, none of this is by luck or chance! It is a formula that you must learn and once you finally get it right, you can produce similar results! Hope this helps someone!Edit: The course is called my self publishing blueprint and they also have a book on it called the self publishing blueprint - how to make your first $1000 online"

none,So I literally JUST got braces like 2 weeks ago and already a wire keeps popping out. I went to get it fixed and then it came out again and i didn't even do anything. I hate to keep going back to the orthodontist office so I just tucked it in behind the bracket but I know it's not ON there on there if you know what i mean. Should I go AGAIN to get it fixed or just wait another month till I get them tightened. I just feel like I would be annoying them as this would be like my 4th time coming in in a period of one month.
none,"Ok so I know many of you have jobs that have a pre employment or random hair test. Passing a hair test is a lot of bullshit and as having gone through the process myself and learning from everyone online I felt my duty was to give back. Here's my past drug use, hair style, and what I did to pass:**Drug use and hair:** ok so a month and a half to 2 months before my hair test I been popping Adderall occasionally. Like I took 30 mgs, and a 20 mg and a half which also is 30 mgs. Plus another 20 mg sometime before. As you know Adderall shows up as amphetamine in a hair test. My hair is curly, short, and so dark brown it's almost black.**What I did to pass:**Ok so first I started reading things online on how to pass and heard of the macujo method and the Jerry G method. I did both. So first I died my hair and colored it back while waiting on supplies for the macujo method to come in the mail. I spent like $400-$500 for this whole process (Worth it because the job I got pays 3 times more than my last job). I did the macujo method like 8 times then my test wasn't the first week it was randomly on the 2 or 3rd day of the second week I started. Before that I did the macujo method 2 more times, used baking soda because it's an alkaline and apparently opens the hair follicles and then I put toxin rid. After that I followed up  and bleached my hair then used toxin rid then redyed it my normal color then used toxin rid. All while doing this my hair was FRIED it was like HAY. To fix this I used overnight hair mask for extremely damaged hair every night. I go in to take the hair test and 2 weeks later I hear one guy that was with us failed so I knew I passed! **Word of advice**If you have a hair test for a job that pays more and is important to you, don't be cheap. Do what I did and you have a VERY high chance of passing. Don't rely on one method, rely on both and over do it. Remember to use hair masks to fix your fried hair. I was worried sick every single day before this test and never had a hair test in my life so if I can do it so can you. Just do what I did!"
none,"I reached a point where I realize I have to quit Adderall. My girlfriend is extremely upset about it and said she'll stop talking to me if I keep taking it. I just know it's time to quit. Its bad because I told her I would quit before but I didn't, I went right back. I wasn't even thinking with my brain I just did it. Its gotten bad to the point where I got a speeding ticket, made irresponsible decisions, and started bugging and annoying my friends Everytime I'm tripping to ask if ""anything is wrong with me?"" Or ""am I a bad person?"" And ""I feel sad"". I feel like I'm letting myself down and my girlfriend because I was completely drug free before all this and I had reached a goal of being drug cigarette and alcohol free but I threw it all away just so I can ""focus"". I'm quitting now. I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of the destruction I've caused and now it's up to me to change it"
none,"I've set goals in the past to make a certain amount of money each month but didn't make the cut. I was wondering if anyone has success with these types of goals. **Note: I am referring to goals about MAKING money, not goals where you ""save"" money**"
none,My main goal right now is to save money for braces but I been dipping in to my savings and spending money on fast food. I know it's stupid and I need to discipline myself and say no. I also been constantly hanging out with friends and avoiding doing the tasks that can help me make more money. Please give me a beating/reality check to get my sh*t straight. I know what I need to do I just need someone to talk some crap and put me in my place so I can go ahead and do it.  Feel free to give me a hard core reality check
none,"So I'm 18 usually at any time will have at least $1000-$5000 saved up. I'm looking for a business or investment vehicle that I can use to grow my money. Ideally I'd like to eventually have like $25000 or more saved up so I can move out my house, pay bills and have more money to invest. So I had a Kindle publishing business where you basically write books or hire people to write them, publish those books on Amazon, and get people to buy the book and you collect a royalty. Little to say the online business model didn't work out for me and I ended up losing money. Yes I literally tried it multiple times. I took a course and followed it to a T. It just wasn't working out and I couldn't keep losing money (I lost at least $500 on this business). It was getting ridiculous and I decided I couldn't keep doing this because if I did I wouldn't reach my goals in time and it required more money than I was willing to put in just to keep losing money. Felt like I was throwing money in a garbage can.**My question is what is a legitimate, low risk investment that I could start and make money right away? I need to come up with money so I can move out my house and pay bills without constantly being worried about money**"
none,"Literally I have been writing my goals down everyday and getting major results I literally made like $2000 this month and put it straight towards my goal of getting braces. And add to that I got MORE money coming!!! I been hustling everyday. I've been learning so much life skills and how to make money. I'm so focused on my goals and I'm ACTUALLY getting results! I go to work, school, applying for college and staying super busy. I don't even go to sleep much because I'm so busy having fun, grinding and living life I don't have time for sleep! I make time to have fun with my friends while still making MAJOR progress on my goals and my friendships have greatly improved I know for a FACT that I will reach every single one of my goals this year plus more.

It's daily goal setting.Before I do anything I adjust my scope (I write my goals down) For example, I write ""my goals are:"" then I write my top 3 one year goals. I do this everydayThe next step is I take a shot. I pull the trigger. (I search for or create an opportunity to reach that goal) and then I take action.This literally is all you need to do everyday and I guarantee you will accomplish so much more in your life. It works for me. I'm thinking of making a picture of what I'm talking about if anyone is interested. I hear a lot of people on here saying books are pointless without work and I agree. You have to HUNT YOUR GOALS DOWN! Literally I wake up everyday, **adjust my scope and start taking shots. My goals are my targets.**Edit: I tried including photo but it didn't let me link it because the subreddit rules"
none,"Hi, I'm 18 years old, I grew up with financially irresponsible parents and due to that I did not grow up with a lot of freedom and privileges that other people had. Due to this, I don't want my kids or their kids to have to suffer the same way I did. I'm dedicating my life to creating generational wealth. I'm writing this post to see if you guys can help me along the path and guide me in the right direction.**My game plan** (help if you see any flaws)So to do this I'm considering going to a technical college to learn a trade like welding until I can go to school again to be a contractor (makes $100,000 a year) either that or I want to get into sales. I'm still undecided. But I think right now the best thing would be get financial assistance (government Grants) to go to a technical college where I can work my way up the ladder in America. I'm already good at budgeting, allocating and saving 50% of my money. I've even learned a little about business, investing, and saving money these last few years. (I tend to experiment and test out things to make money). **End goal**My overall end goal is to acquire multiple rental properties that net $15,000 a month positive cash flow so I can create generational wealth and full control over my life. Even if I don't get to enjoy it, at least my kids will.**What I'm doing now**Currently Im finishing high school, undecided on college (really thinking of going for welding till I can save cash and move up, it's big around here and pays better than where I'm currently working). I currently work at taco Bell and am training to become a manager which will look good on future applications that I'll have manager experience. I'm also reading a book called ""real estate investing for dummies"" and I just finished ""rich Dad poor Dad"".*My main question is am I on the right path to creating generational wealth? I'm at a crossroads right now and can use some guidance. Thanks!***Edit:** to all the people saying I need to ""find myself"" I already know who I am and what I want. *I want money, I want power, and I want stability* I don't have to enjoy what I do. I don't have to ""love my job"". I just have to make a ton of money so one day I won't have to work. Whether or not others agree with that is their problem**Edit 2:** yes I have taken 2 years of welding in high school"
none,"I'm so hurt and in pain its the worst feeling ever. It doesnt even feel real. She cheated on me with my old ""best friend"" and my heart is shattered. She was all I had left. It bothered me when she hung out with other guys but I trusted her and it was only because she lied so good that I believed her. I hate myself and I hate the world. Everything I ever thought was real has only come to stab me in the heart. This world is twisted and I don't want to live anymore. 2.5 years of nothing. I just get walked on by everyone despite my efforts to socialize be positive and be a good person I always end up getting screwed over in evil ways. I hate myself. i'm insecure. I'm tired of living. i hate every single thing about my life. I've attempted so many times to improve my life but im still stuck. I literally am sick and tired of everything.Edit: Although I'm still in shock and still am I'm going to use this painful experience as momentum to MASSIVELY improve myself!

none,"I have this intense romantic feeling like fireworks just thinking about her. When I first started working there and looked in her eyes I fell in love. Like not even in a sexual way. I mean this in a way like I want to get romantic with this girl. This is such an intense feeling I have about her it's like how you would feel when you would dream about your ""dream girl"" or ""dream guy"". It's INTENSE. And I can't help but day dream and want to get romantic with this girl. The only problem (ok there are a lot of problems) is 1. I have a girlfriend currently 2. She's my coworker so there is obvious professional issues with that and 3. I do not yet know if she has a boyfriend or not because I don't want to ask other coworkers and my crush be revealed. Do you think this strong gut feeling is a sign from the universe that I should go for it?**TLDR: Please read the whole thing and don't just skim.**"
none,I did some car insurance shopping last night and got off the phone with a guy saying I could lower my monthly payment to $221 according to the quote and instructions he gave me to do so. But when I checked my email it said $287 a month was the quote? I'm wondering if this is a marketing scam that the insurance agent is using to lure me in. The question is **can you actually go by a car insurance quote?**
none,"I have a vision board in my room and on my path to achieving more income, travel, lifestyle changes etc I'm making changes to my current lifestyle so I can get there and to make those changes it involves other people. But those people are bullshitters. Like I say ok this is what we need to do let's get it done and then they don't take it seriously as it should be taken or they put it off. This attitude is extremely annoying but yet I need these people's Cooperation so I can get where I need to go. Anyone has experience with dealing with BS people?"
none,I write my goals down twice a day and I make to-do lists. Literally it's that simple. Work from a list and keep all your tasks where you can see them and check them off. You don't need anything fancy I just use a normal sheet of loose leaf paper. These 2 things have brought so much structure to my life. I highly recommend writing your goals down twice a day and making to do lists. The reason I believe this works is because your constantly focused on your goals (the important things) while still able to include school/work and other busy activities in your to do list so it all gets done! This method works amazing for me and my productivity and focus has skyrocketed!
none,"I'm 18 and my brothers 16. He never did drugs or anything like that and just today while I went in his room I saw they had vape coils and vape juice on his desk. All he would do is play Xbox and games and all and stay in his room and now he starting to get into vaping I'm worried about him. I can't blame him I fell down the path of trying to fit in and got into drugs, cigarettes, alcohol etc and I ended up quitting because I knew I had messed up by falling to peer pressure but I don't want to see him fall down that same path. I don't know what I should do or say before it's too late. We both live with our mom (single mom) and both my parents are no better (both did drugs alcohol etc). But I'm completely sober and drug free. Like what can I do to prevent him from going that path? I'm afraid I'm losing my brother if you know what I mean"

I'm unhappy with my appearance and I hate to be face to face with people yet that's what's required if I'm going to make money so I could ultimately improve myself. I have all these big ideas of how to make more money but when it comes to act on them I think ""will people judge me because of how I look?"" Etc. Should I just get over it or what do I do? I need to make more money and my lack of self confidence is holding me back"
none,"As a kid I've always wanted to get into real estate. I loved the aspect that you could be in control and get paid rent every month. I'm currently reading a book called ""real estate investing for dummies"" and I'm thinking about dipping my toe in and becoming a landlord now that I'm 18. Tell me what you think about this deal:**The property:** Ok like I said I'm only 18 and I want to dip my toe into real estate. I have an uncle who has had various single family homes in my local area and he has bought this small trailer (think about like a one or two person apartment). It's very small but my grandpa and a friend helped add a nice sized porch to the property and it has a little yard in front plus a driveway. Basically the property is something that someone who would be working and just needs a place to stay could live in. I'm thinking of buying the property off of my uncle, making it look nice, and renting it out to someone who works offshore (I live in south louisiana so a lot of people come down here for the oil field). It's just a little idea I have and in all honesty I'd only make like $400 to $500 a month on it if that, but hey that would be an asset for me and I'd be able to have my first little rent property! Right now it's just a fantasy, but it's very possible I could buy it for at least a couple thousand (if that) because my uncle got it for free anyway and plus he's too busy to give the property the time and attention it needs. I think it would be a good little project for me to fix it up, paint it, and see what it's like to have my first rental property. What do you guys think? Should I do it? (p.s it's like the size of a big camper but it's a lot nicer on the inside and there's a lot of room to make it look nice/like a tiny home if you know what I mean)"

none,"Have you ever really wanted to get into a book and felt that it was hard to get into? Did it use big vocabulary and words that you didn't even know? Well I realized that's a main reason that we avoid books is because when we don't know something it makes us feel stupid and ignorant and therefore we put down the book because we don't like to feel stupid. I mean who likes to feel stupid? You see, I *know* I'm ignorant. I know there's a lot of things in the world that I want to know but I don't know crap about. Anyways the tip I'm going to share is while reading a book **search up every vocabulary word that you don't know as you read**. You'll grow in power and instead of being ignorant you will *know* a lot more! Read books on a subject that you want to get into but don't know the first thing about. Knowledge is power. Take initiative today and kill your ignorance!!!"
none,"Everyday I think about this. At school, in walmart, going through my daily life. I think ""wow if there were less people I would actually feel needed more and could contribute more to the world"". Like the way I see it is everyone is packed into the world like a bunch of sardines in a can and then those people still have the nerve to produce even MORE kids. Like I just feel like I want more space and less people. If we had less people we would have less urban development/cities therefore more uninhabited land. Land would be more available to the common person. We would have more space. We'd have higher pay. More money, more freedom, more space to move around, less of people's annoying opinions and annoying children. Think how beautiful it would be! Now I'm not here to sound like hitler but I am saying that the rapid population growth in todays world is affecting everyones lives. More people means more competition for resources and food. It means more people get looked over. It means that the barrier of entry for a good life is higher than ever simply because there are so many people fighting over the same things you want. The current world population is 8 billion people. Just imagine if we had half as many people, say 4 billion. We'd be a lot more spacious, a lot less annoyed, and a lot more fulfilled in our lives. Everyone's life would mean something and they'd be able to contribute rather than just feel like they're taking up space. Think about it."
none,"Everytime something good happens for me or I say I'm doing something good for myself, my mom always has some bullcrap negativity to throw my way. If I say something she'll just go balogne and start yelling and screaming ""I'M THE PARENT YOU'RE THE KID I MAKE THE RULES"" and she'll have some kind of emotional breakdown and start slamming doors and all when I call her out on her bullcrap and excuses for being a lazy, crappy parent. I can't stand my mom. She doesn't support me but she could at least be nice about it and not negative, doubtful, and pessimistic each time I ever mention any Ray of hope in my life or mention something I'm excited about. Does anyone else have parents like this?"
none,"I'm 18, a senior in high school and just about to finish school. I want to get into sales so that I can make some serious paper. The reason I want a crap ton of money is so that I can have some FU money so people can never tell me what to do again. I want that power and control over my life.Anyways, I really want to get into sales because I hear that people there are making serious money. Should I get into car sales or real estate commissions? Where do I start? A used car dealership or a big brand name car dealer? I want to start a career in sales so I can get commission based earnings. Where do I start?"
none,"I have been at this self improvement thing for a while and Ive had key revelations in what it takes to get results in your life. I believe that to get what you want in life ultimately it's up to you to go get it. That may mean going against the winds and obstacles in life in order to make a specific change that you so desperately desire. Many people will tell you that ""oh yeah affirmations will change your life"" or ""meditation"". While these things may help you they will NOT, in and of themselves, change your life. The beginning of making a single change in your life starts with a goal. From that goal you then have a direction to walk in. Even if you don't know how to get there you create a plan and if that plan doesn't work create another one. Read books on everything you need to know to reach that goal. If you don't have guidance/leadership models guiding you in your life that's no excuse. Man up and take responsibility so that one day your kids don't have to grow up with no answers to their life. Try, fail, experiment, risk, set goals and figure out what it takes to get there. Learn so that one day you can pass it on. The true value in self development is the lessons you learn on the way to achieving your goals. It's the *leader* that you become!"
none,"I just would like to see everyone's opinion on this. Im 18 years old and right now my current goal is to save up for braces. To do this I have my own online business and another income stream that brings in $945 a month. The only problem is I keep pouring money that I could be saving into my business and although I'm not making money now, other people using this business model are and I feel I'm only a second away from achieving success. (I took a course and have been learning from my mistakes) but instead of spending more money on my next product I'm thinking of saving it and putting it towards my goal. I'm tired of making these expensive mistakes in my business and im starting to doubt whether or not it's worth all the money I'm spending on it. don't want to give up but tired of losing money as well since I'm doing this to MAKE money, not lose it. What should I do? Continue to risk it and see if it works out? Or save my money instead?"
none,"At school I used to always wear a dark gray jacket and people would see me as a loser, nobody, downer, etc. Well I started wearing a blue school pullover and people now come up and approach me, treat me better, do kind things for me etc (hold open doors, give me tissues etc). I definitely noticed a huge difference in how others treat me based just on changing what I wear alone. Try it for yourself and see what happens!"
none,"Have you ever felt powerless because you couldn't change your situation? Ever felt pissed off because you had to do things you didn't want to do, live where you didn't want to live, or not be able to afford something that you so desperately needed? That's what not having money is like. It makes you feel powerless and you have to put up with circumstances you don't want to just so you can eat and have a place to sleep. Next time you say money is evil you are really saying that having the power to change your circumstances is evil. Think about that"

none,"Ok currently I am working to increase my income and become ""financially set"" per se. I'm 18 years old and I see people online like Grant Cardone, Logan Paul, etc and they are SUPER RICH. And I am working to set myself up like that as well but I feel like my age holds me back. I'm 18 but I look younger and people don't take me seriously but I am a very serious, results oriented person. Now that I'm 18 and I'm a ""legal adult"" it just feels weird living with my mom still (I can't stand her negative energy) and I want to move out but financially I still don't feel like I'm comfortable enough to make that next move. I want to find new opportunities to make serious money but I just don't know where to look. I took an online course and started my own online business but so far, no major results, but I'm not giving up on it.I know this post was all over the place but I guess the moral of the story is I need money to be independent but I feel people don't take me seriously because of my age and I don't know where to look for opportunities to make serious money. I feel like my age and inexperience is holding me back."

If that is not enough evidence, let's take a look at Grant Cardone, arguably the top entrepreneur and sales person in todays world. He has his own *private jet*, owns millions in real estate, owns 4 businesses, and he's super rich and what does he tell people to do? He says we should ""write your goals down morning and night"". I have been writing my goals down twice a day now for about a month or two, (previously I was rewriting them once a day) and so much has changed. Literally writing your goals down twice a day takes you from being a hoper, wisher, and dreamer to a serious, committed, goal achieving beast! Ever since I started writing my goals down twice a day I feel so focused and results oriented. When faced with a decision I know the *exact* choice to make. I feel limitless. I feel a sense of purpose and direction in my life like I've never felt before. I know where I'm going and I'm so confident in my decisions, it's literally like having the *eye of the tiger*. The reason writing your goals down twice a day is important is because you are constantly reminding yourself of what you are manifesting. If you're not constantly focused on your goals then how do you expect to ever reach them? Journaling, writing my goals down twice a day, and having my vision board are my top 3 habits/rituals for staying on track and manifesting my desires."
none,"Im 18 and recently just got my first job at mcdonalds. Literally right after they hired me, they hired someone else who advanced a lot faster than me because they already had experience with fast food. The first week I got a whole bunch of hours, at least 30. Now I am only getting 8 hours for this week. EIGHT FREAKING HOURS! Lol. But really this situation feels like crap and maybe its because they want me to quit they are giving me so little hours. I'm serious about the job and I am improving but its just messed up when your hardwork goes unrecognized and they hire someone else. I literally have the least amount of hours on the whole schedule.. I got the short end of the stick and it made me feel like they think im inferior at my job or something. Has anyone had this issue before? I know it could just be because they aren't making enough profit but really why cut me out of all people and then hire someone else? The whole situation feels messed up and I'm not sure what I should do."
none,"You're here because you are hungry. You want success. You desire to manifest those things that you never have before. You are pioneering into the unknown. You have your goals, vision board, etc. and each and every day you take one step closer to reaching your desires. Each day you learn something that can get you a little closer. You keep focusing on what you want over and over and over again. *This is how leaders are made!* A leader is someone who knows where they're going and knows how to get results. They lead the way! Think about it. Once you have a vision board and goals you have targets that you are moving towards. You give yourself a track to run on. And even though you don't know exactly how to attain it you still keep taking baby steps, learning, and experimenting through trial and error until eventually you reach your destination! You are a pioneer, a leader in your own right! So next time you feel lost on your journey remember that you are a leader. Your hunger, your focus, and your ability to take action through trial and error will take you to the next destination. Keep looking at your vision board. Keep looking at your goals. Keep taking action everyday and eventually you will get there!"
none,"Im 18, a senior in high school, and I recently started working at McDonald's as my first job in an attempt to make some extra cash and save more money. The only thing is I am constantly surrounded by delicious food all day. I have to make fresh apple pies, baked chocolate chip cookies, hot and spicys, chicken, etc and it's all so freaking good and as an employee I get half off so lately I've been indulging on my breaks and taking advantage of this half off thing but I feel I'm losing money that I could be saving by doing this. Today is Sunday and I'm off of work but yet I literally want to get up and drive to back to McDonald's just to buy a hot and spicy and a caramel frappe.. its so addicting.. it's hard not to when it's all I'm surrounded byHas anyone else struggled with a fast food addiction in their frugal journey? Would love to hear what you guys think"
none,"Let me ask you a few questions and hopefully help you get on the right track. **Have you written down your life plan?** Have you? If you're anything like me you have so many things you just *have* to accomplish before you die. But among these things some are more important than others. What is the sequence? What dream has to come true before another dream can come true? Are you taking the necessary steps in the *right* direction or are you just following goals that aren't even important to you? What will fulfill you? What's that childhood dream that you're burying inside? What do you have to accomplish before you die to be successful in your *own* eyes? Take time to write your dreams out in order, what you need to accomplish before you accomplish the next one. The plan doesn't have to be perfect, just having a plan is better than no plan. Don't leave your future to chance.Second you must realize that **You are responsible for your own change**. No one is coming save you. Your dreams wont fall into your lap. YOU yourself must focus them, make plans to achieve them, and work on them. No one will do the work for you. No reddit post, YouTube video, or ""life hack"" post will change your life. You have to change your life for it to change. We often say ""I want my life to change"" but do you realize that life is not something that is outside of you? You literally *are* your life. Yes that's right! You are the essence of your entire life and you are responsible for everything that happens good and bad. You control your actions, your hands, feet, legs, mind, what you choose to focus on, and what you choose to not focus on. You are in control whether or not you believe that. You have the power to change your circumstances no matter how bad they currently are (believe me. I know how bad it sucks to live in bad circumstances but that's no excuse)So I leave you with this. **What's your excuse? If you haven't changed by now it's your fault and your fault only. To change your life you to change.***""A life without challenges is a life wasted""* - Minh Tan"
none,"Ok so my current major goal in life is to get braces. I just got a new job and I already been saving a lot of money but now with my new job I'll be able to save like $800 a month or maybe even more! My question is should I pick ceramic braces or metal braces? My goal is just to get great looking, straight, white teeth and I can't risk staining on my teeth or enamel loss from choosing the wrong braces. Would like to hear from those who currently have either types of these braces and to let me in on the pros and cons. Thanks!Update: thanks everyone for your feedback! It means a lot to hear from all of you and I'm definitely going to stick with my decision to get ceramic braces! The only reason I was having doubts is because I heard an article online saying ceramic braces could cause enamel loss but you guys say that you haven't had a problem with them so I'm gonna stick with them!!"
none,"I'm a senior in high school and recently I've decided to lead a frugal lifestyle so that I can save more money and have more control over my finances. Being frugal in high school is like you've literally left the matrix of everyone elses mindless spending and now you ""stand out"" as poor or cheap because you don't buy stuff when everyone else does 😂. It's ""spirit week"" at my school and everyone is paying $2 each day so they could ""buy out"" of class to go to some stupid little pep rally and I chose to stay in class and not pay for these buy outs (which I'm still not paying for since it's still spirit week!) Also they have a big Field Trip coming up in my U.S. history class to go to the world war 2 museum and it cost like $45 and I'm not going because I'm so freaking committed to my goal. My girlfriend is trying to convince me to go but the frugal life is so much better than handing away your precious money to anyone who comes out the blue and asks for it! Also I just landed my first job so I'll be saving even MORE money and I don't even drive my car unless I absolutely have to. Like say for school, work, or groceries. Other than that I stay home and it's truly amazing saving money and watching your cash pile up! It may be hard at times but its rewarding knowing that I'M the one in control of my impulses and my money, no one else is! That is truly a rewarding experience for me. Frugal Gang!!! 😂"
none,"I feel your pain. I *know* how it feels when you get rejected, when you fill out application after application and still no job but what you cannot do is give up. YOU CAN'T GIVE UP!!! I had to fill out 6 applications and make 15-20 phone calls to follow up those applications until I finally got an interview. I know the struggle you're going through, I just went through it. But if you are PERSISTENT and keep FAITH you will find a job! Never stop looking. Never stop following up. Keep your head high and keep your eyes on the prize! You will make it!!Edit: Ok all positivity aside this was the most f'd up job ever. I went from having 35 hours a week to having only 8 hours for the next week and then only FOUR hours for the third week. The treatment was horribly and it was so stressful. I tried asking for more hours but I only got less than before. I quit today because I could no longer tolerate the nasty ways I was being treated and having the least amount of hours out of everyone on the schedule."
none,"Hi, my name is Jonathan, I'm 18 years old, and I am a self improvement *freak*. I didn't even know they had a self improvement subreddit until now. I wanted to write this post to share with you my story and the most valuable lessons I've learned in my self improvement journey and how I learned to constantly live my life with PURPOSE!Ok so here is **my story:** I grew up in a pretty poor family. Parents were not abusive but they were neglectful and would rather spend money on ciggarettes, drugs, alcohol etc instead of making sure we had food first. Parents had bad priorities and led by a bad example. I always swore never to be like them. Well fast forward to me turning 15, I was hanging around the wrong group of friends and got extremely into weed, drugs, cigarettes etc. even though I've always been extremely against it. This led me to getting expelled from school and having to go to an alternative school for kids who get expelled. I knew that's wasn't who I was and that I had to make a change. Getting expelled was a total wake up call. I have always tried to improve my life but in my many attempts I would fail and fall back into my destructive habits. When I decided to quit drugs I set a goal for myself and that goal, I believe, is what brought me to where I am today. I remember I wrote ""I will quit drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol 100%"". Now keep in mind that I've never set goals before in my life, this was like the first real goal I set for myself and I actually achieved it! Once I quit, I felt like I was on the right track and started to make even *more* changes. I became so addicted to self improvement, I started reading self help books and doing puzzles to ""repair my brain from the drugs"". I set even more goals for myself and started to achieve them. Goals like quitting soda 100%, writing my first book, making money online for the first time, getting my first car!! I even found an amazing girlfriend that I am still with today (although this wasn't a written goal, it was something I prayed about) I truly believe that once you start achieving small goals, you then have the power to start achieving even bigger goals. I didn't stop there though. It was remarkable as I worked towards my goals and watched goals which were once written on paper become reality before my eyes. So I started asking myself ""what about this is working? Why did I make these goals a reality? What *exactly* caused me to achieve them?"" and then I created my own goal setting process. I will not share that process here (unless of course in another post or something) but I  realized that not only should you have goals but you need plans to achieve them. I started reading books on goal setting and improving my skillsets and investing in courses. I followed people like grant cardone, brian tracy, and people who inspired me to reach my potential. **How to find your purpose:** So after all this experimenting, self discovery, trial and error, reading self help books, taking courses, and following successful people online I finally found my purpose I guess you could say. I figured that goals were the only things that helped me to create change in my life so I found a way that I now use everyday to keep myself laserbeam focused on my goals (which is my purpose). Like I said I made a goal setting process and applied everything I learned from the books (plus what I have learned myself). I used images, specific goals, plans, writing them in the present tense, *all* the skills I learned about goal setting and applied them to my top 3 goals (I recommend only focusing on 3 goals at once) and I now write them twice a day, morning and night. The simple act of writing my goals down first thing in the morning and last thing at night has worked wonders for me and kept me laser focused on my goals all day long. I feel a sense of purpose in my life and it's a lot easier to tell whether or not I am doing the things that are bringing me closer to or further from my goals. Not only do I write my goals down twice a day, but I know what I value in life (freedom and control), and I base my goals off of that. That way I know my goals are connected to my true life values. I also have a vision board that I look at everyday that keeps me pointed in the right direction.**TLDR:** I know this was kind of long but basically I just share my journey through self improvement, explain that to find purpose you should have written goals that are connected to your true life values, and then write them down twice a day (morning and night!) This is where I am today in my self improvement journey and I live my life in a lot more focused and purposeful fashion!"
none,"I've always been pretty good at saving money and being frugal when I need to. I just recently have been introduced to the term ""frugal"" recently I heard about it on the internet. A little about me: my name is Jonathan, I'm 18 years old. I come from a ""poor"" family I guess and I collect $945 a month social security since my dad died (survivor benefits) but that is soon to get cut off once I get out of high school which is in 4 months. I'm currently looking for a job so I can pay my car insurance and reach my goal of making $10,000 this year (I already have $2100 saved and have had to use a rubber band around my money 😀) I am very into goal setting and making plans into achieving those goals. Anyways, my ""friends"" are all pretty much broke but yet they always want to hang out and go places which they never have money for. I invite them to places since I hate going everywhere alone but it's ridiculous how broke some people can be. Literally no car, no money, no money management skills, and just overall stupidity and wanting to mooch off of me and always hang out when I'm the one having to pay gas. This is what usually happens: I get a text on social media from one wanting to hang out and then I usually end up giving in but I'm making a decision to change my lifestyle to reach my goal. Friends simply cost too much and they are literally retarded when it comes to money and think that everything is free and that I'll pay for it. Steps I've taken is blocking all social media notifications and staying at home and driving as little as possible. Hopefully by doing this I can cut down on gas expenses that would have otherwise be wasted on ""hanging out"" with moocher friends. Anyone having similar experiences and insight on what to do in these situations? Love this frugality lifestyle and recently starting taking it very seriously and have seen my money grow!!Update: thanks everyone for all the comments. I'm not going to invest that $10,000 into the stock market for the simple fact that I'm saving for braces. I will invest that however into my smile and fixing my teeth which in the future will most likely result in more money, confidence, and prosperity anyway! (People with good teeth usually make more money than those without). Also, I just feel like they could make the effort towards me and I'm tired of being the one driving to their house all the time. Plus I'm willing to sacrifice my current lifestyle for the betterment of myself and plus I believe my friends will enjoy me much more when I smile more!"
none,"I'm writing this post because I would like to explain very simply the point of nootropics and make it simple for people who don't really understand the purpose of it. I will use the most basic and common stack (Caffeine + L theanine) to explain this idea and how it can free your life. Lets start with...**Dopamine** Dopamine is the part of our brain that is responsible for rewards, motivation, productivity, happiness, and many other things. When we take nootropics, what we are really after is dopamine.**Low dopamine, ADD, low attention etc.** Not having enough dopamine is referred to as low dopamine, ADD (Attention deficit disorder), low attention etc. And low dopamine can be enslaving. Why? Because when you do not have enough dopamine in your brain you are reliant on stimulation from the media, games, time wasters, porn, the internet, texting, sex, cigarettes, etc and various other things to give you that dopamine. This can be enslaving and you become a slave to your brains own craving for dopamine. Well what does this have to do with caffeine and l-theanine you may ask?**Caffeine and L-theanine** When you take caffeine and l theanine you are really just giving your brain dopamine and not just any dopamine but *steady* dopamine. Think adderall, adderall xr, ritalin etc. all these drugs do is give us a steady stream of dopamine so that we don't have to keep searching for stimulation anymore and in turn it fixes behavior problems (problems which were caused by the brains search for dopamine in the first place). l theanine and caffeine is simply a safer way and legal way to get dopamine since you can buy it over the counter and it is not prescription drugs. Together though they add steady dopamine to your brain (now remember dopamine is what causes motivation, productivity, focus, attention span etc)**how dopamine frees your life** So as I explained earlier. Our brain depends on dopamine for its satisfaction. Because of this, we may engage in addictive behaviors and act lower than the highest version of ourselves. Whenever you take caffeine and l theanine, or adderall, or anything that gives your brain dopamine you are freeing yourself from these behaviors because you already have dopamine in your brain and you no longer need to 'act out' or 'misbehave' in search of more dopamine. I will explain this very simply below, please note I am quoting this since I texted this to a friend to explain this phenomenon to him.**Example** ""Here's a cool little example I'll give you of why this is so important: this (texting) conversation right now is releasing dopamine for us. When you do not have enough dopamine in the brain your brain will DEPEND on this dopamine (hence smartphone addiction) but on the other hand when you have enough dopamine this texting conversation will be something you can have and then put down. It won't be a dependency. You will no longer rely on the gratification of a text for dopamine since your brain will already have dopamine running in the background (from caffeine and l theanine). This is why already having dopamine in your brain can free you. Does that make sense?""I hope you guys can get the point I am trying to get across. Dopamine really is what we are after and if we get enough of it and a steady source of it, we can truly free ourselves, be able to focus, and become the best version of ourselves. We will no longer have to depend on anything else for dopamine since we will already have it in our brains (from nootropics) and we will be able to be free and focus on the things we want. Hope this makes sense and that someone can get value from this and that it changes their life forever. Thank you for your time "
none,Been taking 200 mg caffeine pills and 400 mg L-theanine daily. Each day I get scared i'm going to have a heart attack and i feel a tightness/stinging sensation near my heart. Is this normal? I thought L-theanine is supposed to combat the high blood pressure from the caffeine pills. Just so you know I am taking 200 mg Vivarin caffeine pills and 400 mg L-theanine from a brand called spring valley. Would like to know if anyone is experiencing anything similar. I'm not sure if it's anxiety or me just worrying myself into this or if it is actually a problem coming from the caffeine pills themselves. Any advice is highly appreciated and would like to hear your experiences with this common stack and if you felt it's had any adverse effects to your health. Thanks in advance.Edit: Gonna start taking omega 3-6-9 fatty acids and see if that helps.

The website i am making will go under my pen name and im going to have a landing page with a free book if people sign up for my list. the only thing is i have no idea how to do this and where to start. Do i use wix? WordPress? What is webhosting? And how should i go about creating an email list? Where do i get a domain? And how much will i end up paying for this? Right now I'm at the risk taking stage. I know what i want but have no idea on how to do it. If someone can clear up the confusion and give me advice on how to create a website, where to find good templates, a landing page, email list etc etc it would be highly appreciated! Thanks.

You are controlling and abusive towards me and everytime i try to escape you i keep coming back. I hate the way i neglect my family and the things i love for you.  If theres anything i wish for in the whole entire world it would be for us to break up once and for all. That means no more late night calls, I will no longer be checking your texts or making time for you. You hurt me so much and took away so much of my precious life and family time. You've neglected me, abused me, and this is the worst relationship I have ever been in. I feel like you changed me... and not in a good way either. It is because of you, I hate what I've become. I hate the way i kneel down in prayer every night only to feel guilty and ashamed because of you. I've been abused by you for so long that it almost feels normal. Because of you I have felt dead inside, worthless, and have trouble standing up for myself. But not anymore. I've lost my patience with you porn. You are a filthy dirty liar, and you will never change. You have controlled me and abused me for so long and this time I WON'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

none,"Instagram is FULL of lustful images on the explore page and before you know it you'll be caught in an endless scroll of looking at softcore porn. And to all of you thinking ""well just dont look at the explore page"". Let's be REAL here. How many of you can 100% trust yourself to just have that self control? I bet none of us. Remember your brain is still addicted and still wants its fix, at any moment you can go back to that life of misery, pain, and defeat. Feeling like its impossible to stop. Do you really want that? So if you're 100% committed to giving up this addiction, make the sacrifice, delete instagram and anything that can lead you to the rabbit hole. No excuses, no exceptions.**Stay strong**"
none,"Ok guys this is the technique I've been using and it works like a charm. Anytime you get a huge urge or really want to fap you just have to tell yourself ""i can go one more hour"" or ""wait at least an hour"" and when you do this your brain thinks ""oh an hour? I can do that"". The reason why this works is because you're only asking yourself to resist for a short period of time rather than ""oh I have to resist these urges for X amount of days"". When you say ""days"" or ""months""  you are more likely to give up rather than if you say ""just one hour"". Remember those hours add up! So next time you get an urge instead of thinking of your big 90 day goal just focus on making it through the hour in front of you!  Hope this helps!"
none,"I was scared. Contemplating whether or not i should do it. She was reading a book sitting about 10 feet away from me but i said im tired of living in my comfort zone, I'm tired of letting opportunity pass me by! So i risked failing. I risked looking stupid/nervous but i did it and i feel so much better! If i didn't do it i would go the rest of the day hating myself. This is a big step for me and i want this to be an inspiration to any one lacking self confidence, who's scared to talk to girls, or has a bad self image because ME out of all people actually did it and i surprised myself today! Do something that scares you every single day! Force yourself to do it and that way you expand your comfort zone!"

none,"I would like to share with you a mistake that I've made in hopes that this will help you along your journey so you do not have to make the same mistake that I did. Keep in mind im 17 years old, I'm very knowledgeable and intelligent and have read a good amount of books in my time. But yet i still justify pmo.You see you can be smart but no matter how smart you are your addicted mind can still use that against you. Here are some of the lies my addicted brain would come up with to keep me addicted to pmo:*""Dude you have all this knowledge. If you pmo it doesn't matter because you can get straight back into your life's work after""**""Dude as long as you still do what you set out to do it doesn't matter if you pmo""**""Dude think of all the knowledge you have, time management, planning, consistency and discipline, All the things you've been learning. Just pmo and get back to your grind. It doesn't matter""*You see my own evil brain is turning my good into evil. I just woke up to this realization the other day. It gets me to think that because i have learned a lot and have started applying knowledge to my life and taking action, that its ok to fap as long as i get back to whatever my was on my schedule.**DO NOT FALL FOR THIS TRAP**Do not let your brain justify your sickening behaviors.

none,"Hey guys im somewhat new to this subreddit and i just thought i would share with you my goals and my daily schedule. I also have a question or two if you don't mind answering. Thanks  **Goals:**●*Save money and buy my own car.*I'm 17 and have my own license. I collect roughly $700 a month in social security and put  $650 towards savings. I have $4000 dollars saved right now counting Christmas and birthday money. ●*Skateboard every single day consistently.*I started skateboarding when I was 11 and it's something im VERY passionate about, but im not as good as i could be. We have a local skatepark that's going to open soon and i want to improve my skills. I've been getting more and more consistent with my practice. I skateboard everyday. ●*Write and publish my own ebook/book.*This is one of the bigger projects i have going on. I've started writing a book on my laptop and i plan to self publish it to kindle and also get it in paperback. Once it's published i can collect royalties straight into my bank account. The book i plan to write is a simple and short self help book. It's my first ever book. **Daily schedule:** ●*clean bedroom* (im like OCD and need a clean bedroom i can't stand when things are dirty. )●*take care of myself* (hygiene, change clothes etc)●*journal/visualize/review goals* (i make voice recording journals because it's faster and more efficient than writing. Visualization and reviewing goals is to help me get focused, the journals is to document my progress/journey to self development)●*skateboard* (self explanatory. )●*write book*  (i hardly ever get this done. This is what some of you call ""the frog"")So ive been maintaining this schedule and i really love it and it works for me except one thing. I never finish the last task. Which is writing my book. I hear some of you mention ""eat the frog"" which means do the hardest task first. I was wondering if i should do this with the book  (eg; write book before skateboarding)? It's just that i rather skateboard while it's daylight and then write at night (even though i never get it done). I just don't want to be cooped up inside on the computer while it's daylight outside**Note:** i have become a lot better at time management, prioritizing, self discipline, and consistency than in the past. I plan to keep on improving and urge the same to you guys!"

none,It's a damn strong contender for top my top 5 favorite maps. It's such an aesthetically pleasing map as well. I love the bright neon lights and the rain in the middle of the night. The CRBR-S is amazing and super fun to use as well. I hopped on last night for a quick game and ended up doing the Easter egg with randoms. The boss fight was challenging yet fun. The cutscenes were amazing. The story was great. Way to go

none,"Red Dead Redemption and Ghost of Tsushima were my previous favorite games. I think HZD has surpassed them. It's such an amazing and detailed story line. I can't wait to finish this game then replay it.I still have the Grave-Hoard mission to do, but I want to complete a lot of side quests first. I just watched the reveal trailer for Forbidden West to see what's coming, and omg I literally can't wait. I also saw Sylens as a person in the trailer, instead of just a hologram. Idk if I'll see more of Sylens in the rest of this game tho, so please don't spoil it if I will."

none,Played up to the mission were you kill the Sawtooth (I think that's what it's called. It's one of the first missions.) and I can honestly say that this game will probably be in my top 3 favorite games of all time. Everything was confusing at first but I think I got the hang of it mostly

none,"**My question's been answered, thanks.**~~Earlier today, maybe 2 or 3 hours ago, I came across two cards and sold them immediately. I decided I would do a full collection, so I went around the map collecting each set and filling them out. Now the two cards that I picked up hours ago won't spawn, despite me selling them almost immediately after getting them. I went to a new session thinking that they'll respawn, but they haven't. When will they respawn? Because if I sell everything now, I'd get $771.50, but if I collect these two last cards and turn them in as a set, I'll get $1053.~~"

Right now, when I'm happy (as I'm typing this), I'd prefer to be happy rather than mad. Is this normal? I feel like it might be important to add that I have depression and anxiety, both diagnosed."

none,"On round 5, you have to blow up a giant Dark Aether crystal. This gets you sent into the Dark Aether (on accident). It puts you into a small lockdown mode, and you need to survive for 4 minutes. When I was doing it, I went down and went into Tombstone Shadow. If you do this, you will spawn outside of the lockdown, but zombies will still attack you. You also won't be able to move, because there are invisible barriers everywhere. So keep that in mind when doing it."

none,"I unlocked 7 camos for my Diamattis. I only need 9 to get golden viper. I lost connection on round 28, and none of the camos saved. Treyarch really needs to fix camo tracking so it tracks in real-time, not just after the game finishes. Even getting the camo unlocked” pop up, it doesn't save it until the game ends."
none,"Okay, I know that sounds bad, but let me explain. People hate supply drops, mostly because of weapons in it. I think it'd be fun if they brought them back, and only put melee weapons, calling cards, camos (maybe not, discuss below), and weapon variants. No weapons. But, melee weapons aren't only obtained through the supply drops, and you can still do challenges to unlock them. This doesn't mean they should remove the battle pass, they should keep that and the item shop.Edit: I forgot to add that these supply drops shouldn't be purchasable with COD points. Strictly with keys earned from playing. Kinda like Cryptokeys from BO3, but without being able to buy cryptokeys"

none,"I mostly play Zombies, I have around 4 days total played, and a little over 1 day of Multiplayer. I like Zombies a lot more though. The only reason I got the Sledgehammer and the Streetsweeper was to use in Zombies, but they're not very good at all. Can we get challenges in Zombies to do? Like, to unlock the Wakizashi, you need to get two finishing moves per game, 10 times. Perhaps we could get that for Zombies, but make it something like 500 kills while sliding or something. I know myself and others would prefer that."

none,"I'm a bi male and I finally decided to tell one of my classmates who is also bi and we've labelled ourselves ""Bi-Buddies"" 😂 my gf has known about me being bi for a while but it feels so good to tell someone who is also bi and to have someone to talk to about bi stuff with 😊"
none,"Hello, I am fairly new to the game, I have just got the pass to leave Velia. I know I can always go back but I'm wondering if there are certain things I should do before moving on to Serendia? Should I be a certain level/CP/camp level? TIA"
none,"If you're playing ranked and an objective game mode comes up, play the objective instead of using it as an excuse to get your k/d up and losing the match because you refuse to capture the domination points"
none,"Hey everyone, I went to my first pride today!I was really nervous as I'm only out to my girlfriend (and you guys) but she was really supportive and it was honestly such an amazing experience being around so many people who are part of the LGBTQ+ community and for the first time ever I felt like I could truly be myself without fear of judgment. I've got a nice bi flag for my desk now and it's awesome having a physical momento of a part of myself I've hidden for so long. I can't wait to go to more pride events in the future 😁"
none,I'm not going to post a list of complaints as every issue I have with the game has already been posted by many others.What game(s) are you guys moving onto to fill the void after guns of boom?I've been searching for ages and I can't find any game that has as active of a community and that has as active devs as GoB and it's stressing me out that my favourite mobile game has become what it is now.I need a game (preferably an FPS) that has that same magic that GoB once had and I can't find anything.Any and all suggestions are welcome
none,"TL;DR: finally came out to long term girlfriend, was a little rocky at first but now we're closer than ever.Hey guys,At the beginning of the month, I finally took the leap and told my girlfriend of nearly 2 and a half years that I am bi. Things were quite emotional from both of us in the days that followed with me ebing afraid she would leave me for being bi and her being upset about the fact that it took so long for me to tell her and the fact that I hadn't had the chance to be with a guy before we got together.Whenever I've read about people coming out (whether that be as bi or other), I've noticed that the hardest part for people is actually saying the eords to whoever they are comning out to. For me, it was the opposite. We were discussing going to Pride in our town this September and it just came out as naturally as telling her anything else. The difficult part came afterwards. Of course I anticipated a  discussion about my sexuality after coming out, I just didn't realise just how hard that conversation would be. I constantly reassured her that I love her and that me telling her I'm bi doesn't mean I want our relationship to change or end, just that she now knows somethingt about me that she didn't know before. We both got very emotional but after the conversation ended, I figured the hardest part was over. I was wrong.In the days that followed, my partner was a lot quieter than usual and my anxiety went into overdrive. I was convinced that she was going to leave me and I didn't know what to do so it was very difficult for me. Eventually I asked her straight up if she was planning on leaving me and her response lifted an enormous weight off of my shoulders. She was mad that it had taken me so long to tell her but she didn't feel any differently about me or the relationship. Now things are great. She's very supportive of me being bisexual and I feel as though the whole experience has brought us closer together and now we're happier than ever.So yeah, that's my coming out story. Apologies for the lengthy post. Happy Pride Month!"
none,"Since today's update, I've been able to get 2 crates (standard free one and one from an ad) every ten minutes. Is this a bug or an official change to the game?EDIT: Now it is saying that I have to wait 11 hours for one????"

none,I'm a little late to this game but I'm finally playing it. I have GOTY and I'm playing through the base game first before jumping into the DLC. I was just wondering what order should I play the DLC in?
none,"When payload first dropped, I was happy that we had a new game mode to play but I quickly came to despise it, especially now that it's one of the event gamemodes which has really put me off playing this event.If you spawn as the team trying to stop the car moving, it's frustrating trying to win simply because of how slowly you can push it back compared to how fast the other team can move it. I understand that this is because it's reversing so it has to move slowly, but the difference in distance over time just really annoys me. Anyone feel this way?TL;DR: The difference in the car's movement speed between teams makes it super frustrating to play"

none,"Since the last update I haven't had any hitmarker sounds? I've checked all the settings and nothing is switched off that shouldn't be, is anyone else having this problem?"
none,Since launch I haven't been able to play Blackout because it lags so much. I can play MP and zombies without any performance issues on nearly the highest settings for everything but no matter what I change my settings to (even as low as they'll go so everything looks s**t) blackout always lags.Anyone know why this could be?Edit: on PC
none,The shotguns in this game are way too overpowered. I can consistently shoot someone in the head with the Lifestealer and they'll still be able to practically one shot me. Please balance the guns because it's become less and less enjoyable the longer this stays a problem
none,"I am working on self-compassion and loving myself unconditionally because the inner voice is very cruel to me. When I think of someone who may love me (like my sister or father), I get sad. Why?"

none,"About fifty feet from my house, there's a wonderful little park for the neighborhood children. There's a slide, a few bars to climb on, some monkey bars, a bench or two, and a small basketball court that doubles as a soccer court. All of these are surrounded by some gravel and various sorts of native greenery. It's really quite cute. The park is surrounded by a fence, which is about a meter high. There's a special type of gate in it, with handles that are difficult to open for children. You have to push in some blocks which stick out from the knob before you can turn it to open the gate. It's quite effective at preventing children from running out into the street. Many cars pass through this street and everyone parks along the sides of the road near their houses which line the street. A small yellow sign is fastened to the gate: **Close the gate for children**. I often see children playing on the bars. I pass through it to get to my house from the train station, as it's the shortest route. I still sometimes struggle with the gate knob. My hands aren't necessarily small, but I suppose they aren't exactly agile. After work, I walk home from the station and relax with a cup of tea. I usually get home while it's still light out but sometimes my work keeps me late and I arrive after dark. After work, my friends invited me out for a drink, which I decided I wouldn't turn down. Heavily buzzed, I managed to find the correct train home, probably thanks to muscle memory, after dark. I walked along the gravel path to my house. I approached the park and was about to grab the knob when I noticed something strange. The park was dark aside from a single lamppost near to me, which was probably about 20 meters from the opposite side of the park. I'm not good with measuring distance but not more than a minute walk. Anyways, the lamppost was on but occasionally flickering. I noticed a new feature to the park too. The sign reminding people to close the gate behind them was illuminated: **Close the gate for children**. I didn't think many people would need an illuminated sign because it's night and children don't play at this time. Or so I thought! Faintly, on the other side of the park, I could see some small shapes which seemed to be playing on the various bars of the jungle gym. I didn't often see children play here this late. When I was a kid, we'd get kicked out in the early afternoon after lunch and we'd play until sunset before returning home. I reached for the knob and tried to press in the buttons while turning the knob as I always do. And I struggled, of course, because I don't deal with such door knobs requiring such dexterity. I struggled for a few seconds and glanced up sheepishly at the kids. I don't need their approval but I don't like to embarrass myself in front of anyone. In the faint light, I could see they all stopped playing and were facing me, their eyes glowing faintly in the light of the lamppost. I looked back down and jiggled the knob in frustration. I'm pretty tall, so I decided to just hop the small metal fence when I usually give up on the knob. I looked over to the children and saw their forms had approached me slightly. I swung my leg onto the fence and rested it there for a sec to catch my breath. Does anyone else feel like it's more difficult to breathe when drunk? I mean, buzzed. My pant leg started to billow aggressively on the fence. I stared dumbfounded before turning my gaze to the children. They had disappeared except for their eyes. I had a bit of double vision but I counted at least 6 pairs of eyes. Maybe 12. It's hard to tell. I looked back down to my leg and tried to swing it again, but I slipped on the ground. The gravel stones had been moved out of this area from the foot traffic and only a patch of—apparently slippery—sand remained. I fell on my ass. Luckily I'm still trying to lose some weight so that cushion of fat broke my fall. Right as I smacked down, the light in the lamppost flickered out and stayed out. I looked up again and the glowing eyes had completely disappeared. Only the signs on either side of the park remained illuminated. I decided to give up on the park since the light went out and apparently it had become Fort Knox, so I went the slightly longer route. I back tracked a bit to a smaller alley and headed home once more. As I approached my house, I looked back at the park. The light had turned on a bit, possibly the faint connections of the light realigned somehow. I'm not sure, I'm no electrician. It was glowing faintly. I could see the shadows in the park near the metal bars. Their eyes were fixed on me once more. I could see the illuminated outline of the sign: **Close the gate for children**"
none,"Set an alarm for a certain time and then work on your task. When it goes off, you can snooze it if you're working hard. If you aren't working, it serves as a 9-minute interval (each time you snooze) reminding you to get back on task. I suppose this really only really works if you are in a place where you can be somewhat noisy. I like to add a message to my alarm to motivate/denigrate me (such as you can do it!” or get back to work you lazy sack of shit”)"

none,"I am in need of advice. I have been suspecting and questioning this for a while now, yet I still can't come to a conclusion. I am attracted to my fiance and we've been together for 8years now, but I do feel like I need to figure this out for my own sake. During school, I did not care much for relationships, but often found myself looking at girls, too. As I grew up (currently 25) I kind of just pushed the thought of myself being a different sexuality aside because that also was easier at the time. I have never ""explored"" with women, yet I do find women attractive. I feel extremely conflicted within myself as calling myself straight feels like a lie, but how can I be certain I am bisexual? I've never had any bisexual experiences to confirm or deny that.  I mean, I find both men and women attractive, can it really be just that simple? My fiance has been wonderful in supporting me and being patient with me, he hasn't tried pushing me in either direction, but this uncertainty is really bothering me. How do I know for certain?"

I have to kill him before he enters and makes a Japanese BBQ. I take a shot, **MISSED**. another one, **MISSED** again.  Too late, he makes it into the bunker out of my sight. I run up to find and kill him. Quietly I walk through the hallway of the bunker, turn right into a room. A fucking charcoaled team mate... *Regret level rises*. But I have to move on. I quickly step to the next room and low and behold I find another mate burned to a crisp. **GOD DAMN IT**. The regret feels real. I have to stop this fucker before he kills more of my people. I run out of there rushing to find this guy and all I see are burned bodies everywhere. Regret takes over and **soars my ping level to 500** I am stressed. I look everywhere for this monster. I run across to the of the bunker and finally see him hiding in a corner fumbling with his pistol that he probably never used. *because he's a flamethrowing pussy*. I take one shot at him, **but god damnit my STRESS is too high.** he runs up and melees me to death. True story.I wish i had shadowplay on for this.  Seeing those people burned to crisp because I couldn't kill one guy hurts my heart."

They are fiercely loyal and honor bound. If a hunter gives you his word it is held as a sacred oath and if it is broken their life is traditionally considered forfeit.  Hunters survive completely off meat and fluids. They stand 7 to 8.5 feet tall and weigh about 300 pounds. Their skin is a camouflage,blue and orange for thoraxian, purple and black for outlander but with effort can change color and pattern. They have a 180 degree field of vision from 2 large compound eyes. Their mouth is made of 4 sharp fang lined mandibles and a lower jaw.  They live to be 2000 years old on average they come of age at age 150 and are considered elder at 1800. Young hunters are often considered proud and headstrong by outsiders. Between ages 20 and 100 they are intensely schooled in tracking and hunting prey. Their feet look like bird feet with three long toes in front and one in the back They have a 2 foot retractable spike in that comes out of each foot capable of being used as a weapon(1d4 piercing) . More wealthy hunters sometimes carve ornate designs into their spikes as a symbol of status. Often these spikes are coated with poisons/paralytics. Hunters have only one gender that reproduces asexually upon reaching a point where they are deemed worthy and willing by the gods.Names include Xilias, Kyroogrik, Ragnurak, Savvaarius, Xios, Thungrad, Dios, Dranaleth,Pyresius, Gruuth, and Sikroth.Surnames are just titles given upon their 200th year highlighting their greatest feature (ie savvaaruis swiftfoot, known for his spectacular agility)+2 dexalignment tends to be lawful/ neutralLanguages lizard and commonmovement speed 35subraces    ThoraxiansThoraxian hunters dwell chiefly in the forest and as such are great at maneuvering difficult terrain and moving in 3 dimensions. They traditionally favor the bow and small knives over large melee weapons and are therefore proficient with both long and short bows.  They are far more territorial than outlands hunters and don't tend to trust outsiders. +1 constitutionBow proficiency     Outlanders Hunters of the outlands are industrious and friendly, they live mostly in the mountains and hills. They play host to large libraries and trade schools. Their lands are difficult to cross but they are happy to show the way in exchange for goods, coin, or knowledge. Though they may be friendly, threaten their home or loved ones and you will be met with the taste of steel as from age 150 to 200 they have compulsory military service where they are trained to dual wield rapiers. +1 strengthRapier proficiency I can answer any questions about their societal structure that anyone has.
