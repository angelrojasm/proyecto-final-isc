ptsd,We'd be saving so much money with this new housr...its such an expensive city.... I did some googling in their language and found that it was illegal for them to do that. I was excited like oh ok if it happens ill call the police on them....  but now i did some further googling and turns out that if you sign the contract with that in it than everything is on their side... The contract is long term so we'd have to give 6months notice before leaving even if we give it next week ill still have to live six months with this.... i wanna die i swear i havent been so helpless and scared in so long.... Also two days ago my friend mentioned he ran into my ex who ruined my life and that he told him he wants to see mw and get closure.
ptsd,"My ex used to shoot back with ""Do you want me to go with you?"" all the time, no matter what it was. I almost wonder if I blocked out him asking me that about our own wedding. I unloaded a terrible memory of this on my current BF today and he took it like a champ, I just could not stop chasing myself in circles over this and knew if I heard any sort of similar phrase I would lose it. I just needed to throw this out in the open, where others who might understand could 'hear' it."
anxiety,"More specifically, for example, I live with roommates and I can't remember the last time it has been quiet in the apartment. There's never a moment where it is completely silent and I know it's anxiety and sensory overload, but gosh does it make me angry. My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she's one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren't related to the lesson at all. It was so hard to stay in that class without storming out because I couldn't handle listening to her loud voice any longer."
ptsd,"Yesterday afternoon, two black males attacked me from behind, took my phone, and shoved me to the ground. The police came and did all the investigation he could and I came to my hotel I'm currently staying at (I'm traveling right now-yes female solo travel can be dangerous lol), slightly scraped and shaken but no major injuries. The police weren't hopeful that they will get to find my phone with all of my not-backed up travel photos but at least I survived the day and I can get a new phone! Money doesn't concern me, I'm just really bugged that I won't have all of my photos from two-week travel. The thing is, I was scrolling through youtube to find phone reviews (so that I can get a new one and not regret it lol) and clicked on a video with a black male person showed up."
ptsd,"PTSD is life changing for the worse. Every day fight. Getting in a fist fight in high school( who did not get into a fight)  I'm not talking about bullying,  Playing video games,  having bad dreams does not cause PTSD. We have seen things, or done things or ,been part of things,  that most people will never understand and hopefully never experience. End of Rant"
anxiety,"I have a lot of self esteem. I value myself, I believe I'm smart, have a good personality and am attractive. Some days though (perhaps most), I will still get anxiety. I'll start to talk to some people and for no reason at all feel my heart rate go up and start to overthink the things I say, which then leads to me coming off as awkward. This doesn't happen with the people I'm fully comfortable with."
ptsd,"If I continue, I start to physically feel like I'm floating and nauseated. My instincts tell me to run.  I am to begin to treatment next week and was wondering if anyone has used a weighted blanket. If so, did it help with the physical symptoms? Ive expressed my fear to the specialist I am seeing."
anxiety,"I have a vague fear that I get when I'm ""alone"", or when such a situation is coming up. I put it in quotes as it is really when my wife is not going to be around. This weekend my wife and oldest daughter went away early saturday got back mid day sunday. I was home with my youngest. I had some mild fear about it leading up to it."
anxiety,Not sure the best way to describe it but for the last week and a half I have had to be social and around people every day except for a couple of hours each evening and it is KILLING ME. I’m on edge constantly because I need a break to just start over. And now I’m on the way to a 3 day work seminar in another country and I feel like there is zero mental energy left. I get back and then have work on Monday again. Anyone else feel like they need a day or two alone to “recharge” their (mental) energy?
ptsd,"My wrists start to itch. My bruises from rock climbing and martial arts remind me of other, past bruises. Nightmares. I had such a fucking nightmare last night. Nightmare on top of nightmare."
anxiety,"But I just can’t do what I need to do because I am terrified that I am doing the “wrong” thing, regardless of what decision I make. But the current situation (doing nothing) is extremely detrimental as well. I feel like a total loser and I am deeply ashamed of this anxiety, though I know that it is nothing to be ashamed of. I’m confident in so many areas of my life, but anxiety targets me and I become immovable. This is one of those times."
ptsd,They weep after every session with me and all I can do is give them the thousand yard stare. I don't even know how to feel yet my girlfriend says I'm selfless to a fault how I can be I don't know she always says she wishes she could have rescued kid me from my mother and has been the saint of a women that is still by my side and still wants to marry me. How and why I don't know I feel worthless ans like I have nothing to offer up other than my love and the constant promise I'll never leave her. I have lashed out so many times at her for things not even done by her and I die inside a little more everytime I do. I know she knows why it happens and understands the brain chimstry behind my psych issues as she is a sociology and psychology major/minor.
anxiety,"It started with a panic attack that led to hypertension. I felt my heart pounding with shortness of breath. I felt dizzy, and I thought I was having a heart attack, this was the first time I ever experienced this. I thought I was going to die. I went to the ER."
ptsd,"He also tortured me in several other ways, like subduing me and pressing his knee into my temple or heatbutting me in the nose as a way to start a fight. I started taking martial arts and self defense classes and I started retaliating against him, when I was around 15. He'd also hit my mom sometimes and I'd protect her. One time while trying to avoid his chokes I cut my head so bad that blood was gushing all over the room - and when I got him off me, he came back and headbutted me in the nose and tried to choke me again, after which I threw him over the table. The whole room was covered in my blood and he was still relentless."
ptsd,"My ""symptoms"": I know this probably isn't nothing compared what other people go through. I even thought this didn't affect me, I thought most people go through either the same or worse, until I was about 20 years old. But once every day, or every 2-3 days, I get intense, intrusive memories about these events. I feel extreme anger and hate, my heart rate goes sky high, sometimes even my hands start shaking."
anxiety,"&#x200B; I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate for the thread. I don't really know if it's appropriate anywhere. I guess that's the point? ""Am I normal or am I fucked up?"""
ptsd,"I feel like a completely different person. My best friend suddenly died in September and I thought I was finally healing from her sudden death, and now this horrible tragedy. I feel like I can’t relate to humanity anymore except for people who have also unfortunately experienced this. Everything seems so trivial and empty. I already had anger issues before this, due to traumatic brain injuries, and now I feel a paradoxical combination of extreme rage/complete emptiness, etc."
anxiety,"Wondering if anyone has this same problem and if anyone has found a way of overcoming it. Regardless of who messages me (family, friends, strangers) I avoid opening the message (text message, email, social media message, calls, voicemails) and avoid replying until hours later or even the next day. I don’t know why I do this, but I feel like it takes so much of my energy to open the message and reply and it’s almost like I don’t want to have a continuous conversation with anyone. It’s very bad for trying to maintain healthy relationships. Does anyone else suffer with this from anxiety?"
ptsd,"I have reduced my drinking a ton since i started it and by the second week I could already feel a major improvement in my anxiety and mental clarity, but it may have been largely due to my reduction in alcohol. In the past three days I have felt myself beginning to spiral and today I am feeling very very dark, very disconnected. I am such a low dosage I am wondering if maybe it's just not working and what I thought was it working was actually just reducing the alcohol intake? Because now all I want to do is crawl into bed.. or drink.. fantasizing about self harm. I also feel like I'm just obsessed with feeling bad and I am doing this to myself."
anxiety,"i know this is a common problem that many people have but i dont know what to do. i dont sleep at all on sunday nights and it fucks up my whole week. im scared of the sadness i will feel as soon as i wake up, im scared of having to repeat the same day over and over until friday, im scared of waking up in a panic attack, im scared of having a long complex dream and then waking up not remembering it or not liking it. the stupidest things freak me out and im so sad and tired. i brought this up to my therapist towards the end of my session but she didnt really have an answer, and i didnt bring it up the next week."
anxiety,"Okay this is driving totally insane and I can't function normally because of it, I have had intrusive thoughts basically for as long as I can remember, though now they are pushing me closer and closer to insanity. I am only focusing on one disturbing thought now which I really only need serious and helpful answers for. To start off, I remember it being the start off 2015 and I was sleeping over at my best friends house who we will call ""J"". Now J and I would always stay up all night when having sleepovers, and this certain night I managed to pull through to 6:30 am 30 minutes after J had fallen asleep, though when I woke up I was in his sisters bed. Now since then up until now, I just assumed that I was literally half asleep and that I was just looking for anywhere comfortable to sleep that wasn't taken in my literally half asleep state of mind (both his sisters had stayed up all night in the living room I've believed up until this moment, also something to keep in mind is that both of us were to young to be consuming alcohol and I have no memory of myself entering their room."
anxiety,"I stopped eating and stopped sleeping... I eventually ended up in A&E after telling my family I intended to kill my self, I'd already been self harming and pulling out my hair from the stress. I lost a stone and a half in weight in a month. I was given sleeping pills as I had not had the rest to let my brain consider recovery, and I was given lorazepam for the holidays so I could get out of the house to have Christmas with the family. I now only use lorazepam for panic attacks I have at work or situations I cannot leave when I panic , like catching a plane."
ptsd,"I’m so tired of people evaluating me visually and telling me “I look fine” when 3 TBIs and complex PTSD are, by nature, invisible. I feel so alone in this, and judged because my resilience activities, running and lifting, make me appear perfectly normal. I’m desperate to overcome these issues, especially given my profession and the need to operate in crowded conditions. Army docs dismiss my problems because I look capable and am a high-achiever despite it all, even questioning whether the incident resulting in my PH “actually happened”. I need someone to believe me."
anxiety,"I've never been medically diagnosed with anxiety, and I know that I would need to see a professional to officially determine if I really had anxiety, but sometimes I relate to symptoms of anxiety I see online and wonder if I should be concerned. Some things that have led me to think I may have anxiety: I've been performing on stages for all of my life, but I still find my heart racing and knees weak every time I'm on stage. One time, I messed up a performance, and when I saw my peers the next day, I had to remove myself from the situation and go to a place where I could be alone. I don't mind public speaking though."
anxiety,"I keep it together at work and hear I'm doing great, but I'm always on the edge of falling apart. I've been through tough adjustments before which always suck, but this is hitting me differently, maybe because it's high level/can't and don't want to quit. (But kinda want to win the lotto so I could quit). I want to get through this transition and get good at this job, bit I can't do survival mode much longer. Working too much but idk how to stop."
ptsd,"How...do I do that? How much/how little should I say? How can I face my class and my RAs again now that they know I'm a nutcase? TLDR: Had a meltdown in trauma class, and I'm afraid it'll happen again. How do I tell my professor and prepare for the almost inevitable hellscape that is my inability to keep my shit together?"
ptsd,"By the fourth infusion, I was able to sleep through the night, and only got a mild feeling of anxiety when talking or thinking about it. Today, while leaving my psychologist's office, I saw someone get hit by a car. It was not pretty. He died. Right as I'm starting to move past one, another happens."
ptsd,"I’m a previous victim of abuse at home and since moving to university (the abuse ended way before uni) I’ve experienced very frequent nightmares both relating to and completely unrelated to my previous problems. It’s hard for me to go more than 3 nights without having at least a couple of nightmares a night, most of which relating to my trauma. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, would anyone be able to offer some advice on how to address these nightmares as they’re starting to affect my studies. Thank you in advance"
ptsd,I leave and breakdown in the kitchen because I’m still scared and freaked out. And the fact that I feel that I have to apologize for being triggered and am unable to control my reaction infuriates me. The part that confuses me is that when I was assaulted as a child I was never held down. I was frozen in fear. So why am I panicking over this seemingly innocent situation?
anxiety,"This is one if the most perplexing symptoms I get when I'm in high anxiety or panic mode. It's the only time I can think of as yawning as being stressful. I have a lot of fatigue anxiety. The more anxious I get, the more fatigued, which makes me anxious. I've almost fallen asleep after calming down and then I have a big yawn and that just restarts it."
anxiety,"I tried explaining this to her, but she said I should have redone it and she would never have turned something like that into her boss. When she asked me to work on it, she asked for information. Not a full spreadsheet of detailed numbers or anything. During this meeting, I got very anxious, told her I was anxious, and actually started crying. (Typical reaction when I don't have control over things and my anxiety jumps.)"
anxiety,"However, my mind is set on the possibility of diabetes or MS as an explanation for my symptoms. My depersonalization has come back strong and I've felt very tired recently and I don't know what is symptoms are causing/caused by other ones. I've been anxious this whole semester to a high degree but I've never felt symptoms like these before. Someone help? EDIT: For reference, I'm 5'9"", 173 lbs"
anxiety,"I struggle to know what it is I should do most of the time... during this anticipatory stage. If my anxiety oscillated between normal followed by panic, I wouldn’t feel so confused and constantly question what I should be doing right now. There aren’t any damn patterns. Further, It seems like most of the anxiety coping techniques (deep breathing, exercise, meditation, etc) are only effective at keeping the feelings at bay while you’re doing them. 30 minutes later you’re right back where you started."
ptsd,"But I have been on about a dozen times, and have been hung up on nine. It is always the same issue, sadly. I get depressed, it is late, I cannot sleep or stop thinking about past trauma, and I would just like to talk to someone. But the bulk of them have hung up, some almost immediately, and some after longer. It is the longer ones that hurt more."
anxiety,"Every once in a while I get the concept of death stuck in my mind. Thinking I’m not going to be here anymore, thinking my parents won’t be here, thinking what’s going to happen after I die. Just thinking about how we all are mortal. That gives me such bad anxiety I disassociate and I try to go back to normal, I can’t. I’m in that state right now and I really don’t know what to do."
anxiety,"I absolutely get along with this family member, it's just that I'm an introvert and have social anxiety, and I just really like my alone time. I am an anxious mess at even the thought of company! I hope I can pull this off without acting like a bitch or a freak. I've asked my husband to be understanding and not make me feel worse or put me on the spot. I worry the house isn't clean enough, what will we eat, etc.."
ptsd,"I realized how small nuances subconsciously give me thoughts without me feeding into it. They feed into itself and I watch it do it all on its own, and it causes responses in my body and anxiety without trying. It's almost as is if another person is living in here but what it is, it's all instinctual. The awareness has given me a better grasp on things but it feels like an illness now with this new perspective because it comes over me like one. It's like being drugged and having no control over the effects, and you have no choice but to let it occur, and you fight any urges it gives you, although you may be aware of it happening."
ptsd,"for years i've had this overwhelming sense of doom, this feeling of having been fucked up. i hate to even say this considering he has his own history of csa and physical abuse, but i genuinely wonder about my dad sometimes. there's just this awful feeling that hits me out of nowhere sometimes. i cant breathe and everything is just awful and i feel so sure that something happened. but other times i feel so stupid and evil for even thinking that."
ptsd,"i experience dissociation. i get this feeling like there;s a pill in my throat. i soemtimes wonder if maybe the reason i struggle so much is beacause something happened to me? but idk. i'm probably just overthinking this the way i do and making something out of nothing, but i've been wondering off and on and pushing these thougths away for a few years."
anxiety,"I don't get anxious over things that I know won't happen and i don't get anxious in social situations, but i feel like if i stay with my dad, who right now especially needs someone to be with him, I'll be thrown into an inescapable pit of despair because all I'll do is worry about him. But if I leave, I'll be the loneliest person on the planet, and I'll still worry about him because he's my dad and i really do love him. Not only that, but im a college student who takes 14-16 units a semester and I'll have to start working 30-40 hours to move out and i just feel like i can't do it anymore. I have friends who back me up in everything that i do but some days (like today) its not enough. I just want to be at least at peace with myself but no matter what option i choose i can't even manage that."
ptsd,"Yeah, not so much. I had a minor surgery on my neck today that just used local anesthetic, so I was fully conscious for it. Everything was fine since I'm not squeamish - until I realized they needed to strap me down to make sure I didn't move. It's a delicate procedure; I understood. But I hadn't been in restraints since the medical trauma, and I completely dissociated."
ptsd,"I may try a new medication. Antidepressants were ok but kind of turned into an unfeeling zombie, which wasn’t good either. It’s hard to describe, but the vigilance goes beyond traditional anxiety and it can be embarrassing. I don’t like it if it affects the mood of others around me, or even makes people want to stay away. Has anyone had luck with medication that soothes you enough, without making you groggy or disconnected?"
anxiety,I’m asking now because my partner told me to eat a chicken schnitzel Parma instead of my ham and cheese sandwich. I freaked out. I almost had a full-on fight with him because I didn’t want to. Felt like I couldn’t. I almost broke down into tears.
anxiety,"I was so sure that tattooing was the career I wanted to get into but after completing the apprenticeship and even working as a tattoo artist AND piercer for about a year, I find myself still fucking miserable. Maybe even worse than before. The first tattoo shop I worked for was great but I had to move and I struggled finding another shop like that one. The owner of the last shop I worked in was just a total fucking asshole and treated me like dirt. There's a lot more detail with that story but to make it short, the entire experience made me terrified of going into tattoo shops now."
ptsd,"I feel like the trust I worked so hard to build and the work I put in improving myself by going to therapy, dealing with the anger and the fact I was quick to be violent (old habits die hard...), dealing with and accepting the fact I've also got ADHD and autism, becoming a better man and not following in the footsteps of my dad is just... gone. Destroyed. Utterly fucked. I feel betrayed and completely alone because she was the only person I trusted on this entire planet. I can't even look at her even 4 days later and I've barely spoken to her since."
stress,"I am called back as a few secondary characters in a play with plenty leads and these character have one line each and sometimes no lines at all so I’m basically ensemble again. To top that off I got called back as the same four characters that like 13 girls are going to compete for and one of them is a new girl in school that this was her first audition. I’m a bit jealous and I know I shouldn’t be but I’m not jealous that the new girl got in, it’s a mix of jealousy and disappointment and dissatisfaction in myself. Plus these two guys that I might have a slight crush on are called back for main characters that kiss the leads in the play so I’m a bit mad about that too. Sorry for ranting so much and I might sound like a bitch but I just need some place to rant and this felt like the best place for it since I’m so stressed and mad at myself about this."
ptsd,"I went through sexual assault less than a year ago and I still find I have flashbacks, I get anxious over it. I don’t tell many people this. I told one friend and a few days ago we got into an argument and he ended up saying that it was my fault it happened. I haven’t talked to him since and I’ve deleted his number, but he keeps messaging me as if nothing happened. Am I being irrational in ignoring him for this or is he just an asshole?"
anxiety,"My mood has been worse because it’s so fucking hot in the uk and I feel sticky and gross 24/7 unless I’m in the shower. Maybe dehydration is the reason behind my depressed anxious feeling? I really thought the meds were helping me before this so I don’t want to give up on them....but I don’t know what to expect right now. Sorry for going on too much, advice would be amazing right now. ❤️"
anxiety,"This has only started in the last few days. My mood has been worse because it’s so fucking hot in the uk and I feel sticky and gross 24/7 unless I’m in the shower. Maybe dehydration is the reason behind my depressed anxious feeling? I really thought the meds were helping me before this so I don’t want to give up on them....but I don’t know what to expect right now. Sorry for going on too much, advice would be amazing right now."
anxiety,"But Kim Jong Un has already fired more missile than his dad and grandpa combined. How worried do I need to be on the East Coast of the USA? I'm trying to calm down with breathing exercises and busting my mind with Netflix. It's helping a bit, but I'm really on edge. I've got an appointment with my doctor next week, so I'm hoping maybe a higher dose of medicine can help."
ptsd,"This weekend was terrible, and I guess I wanted to talk about it. Even before this I've been a bit detached and increasingly jumpy. Any sudden sounds or movements I don't expect make me jump. Sometimes I startle so hard I actually pull a shoulder muscle. This weekend though just was worse than usual..."
anxiety,"This may be a ridiculous question, but I feel like I go to pee way to many times more than average and It's starting to make me insane. I wanted to get this out of my mind. I think it may be a psychological problem, like an anxiety ""symptom"". Because when I'm at home for an entire day, it's fine. But when I'm in school or in any other public place I get that thought: ""What if I suddenly have to go while I'm doing an exam?"""
anxiety,"Hey guys. This post is primarily obsession and compulsion orientated. I did want to post in the OCD sr but it’s pretty quiet in there. I’m a 19 year old male from the UK and in terms of my anxiety, this has truly been the worst year of my life. My most common obsession theme throughout my life has been to do with my health but for the last two years I have been dominated by intrusive thoughts about being a homosexual when I’m not and being a pedophile."
ptsd,"If you don't, find one. It helps so much and may be the only way I have gotten this far. I think it is just so scary because there is nothing that feels like this isn't just how life is from now on. I feel like I fight every day just to be able to be this crappy shadow of the guy I used to be. I feel like there is nothing to look forward to, and all I have is just trying to fail at everything in the least humiliating way that I can."
ptsd,"I really need to get this off my chest because I don't feel like anyone I can talk to in ""real life"" right now is going to understand (I am seeing friends Wednesday though). I had a horrible weekend. Boyfriend and I want to move next year. This weekend we visited a city we were thinking about moving to and we **hated** it. I was so discouraged and feeling so vulnerable by the whole thing."
ptsd,"The news is always problematic for folks with PTSD, but it just feels so much worse lately. I am not one to regularly get triggered by the news, but this weekend just was too much. I just felt like I was swept into this gigantic downward spiral. I really want to go clean up my room and get some food ready for tomorrow (the work week) (AKA do some ""adulating"") but I am so exasperated, exhausted, and burnt out that I just can't. And that is going to make the week even worse."
anxiety,The online therapist who was helping me through by depressive anxiety disorder ghosted on me without furnishing a reason. What's worse is I spent a majority of my waking time in the office and I feel so alone and out of place there. I would love to have somebody I can trust but theres always something. Ugh can't keep doing this. I've not been getting sleep over this feeling.
anxiety,"I'm just so tired of everything. I want my life back, I want to travel and get a degree or just a job. I am coping now because I started drinking heavy, I know it's not the best thing but it keeps me calm for now. I just don't know what to do anymore to be honest. Festival season is starting next week and all my friends are excited to go and see the bands."
anxiety,"I have tried every basic medicine like Prozac, Zoloft, etc. right now I take 15 of Buspar twice a day, Effexor 150 once, and 30 of Vyanse twice a day. I can’t get out of bed or do anything without Vyvanse even though it lasts maybe 5 hours. Ican sorta tell a difference from the Effexor, like I don’t feel as emotional. But I still experience severe anxiety almost every day and it does nothing to help my panic attacks."
ptsd,"(although i’m scared it’ll change me) TL;DR: I suffer from mental illness, and am leaving a relationship with my girlfriend. This is hard for me because she was the best and only friend I had and i’m in a very bad spot physically right now so i’m very isolated and lonely and in an unsafe place with my abusive father. I need to find someone to talk to because i’m hearing voices from an inanimate object and am becoming inseparable to it. how do I make friends whilst having my anxiety?"
anxiety,"I feel so overwhelmed, I am excited as hell, and twice as much anxious. Any one else experience this before a big dream job or something?? How did you, if you did , beat out anxiety? ? luckily I haven't had a panic attack because I know how to keep myself at bay... but I am on the edge of my seat 24/7..."
anxiety,"New to this sub. Here is some background information about myself. ------------------------- I developed anxiety in my freshman year or high school. The traumatizing event happened when I was young, but an event when I was older triggered memories and sensations, and from then on I have dealt with axiety and panic attacks."
ptsd,"She's the first person I've ever really opened up to. I haven't told her everything about whats happened, but she does know about my anxiety (which I get from my PTSD) and she reacts sportively to it. To some extent, I let me be ""myself"" around her, whatever I am. She's moving. She's moving to Maryland."
ptsd,"Will I ever like it? I feel like a fucking rejected piece of society with my son being the only purpose of my life (which I love every single second of being his mother) I need help. I don't know what to do, I've tried therapy and it hasn't helped in the slightest. I honestly can't even afford it anymore. I'm also hesitant to try medication because I'm still nursing."
ptsd,"Don’t worry there are 3 police cases “in process.” But it is very sad how hard you have to fight to get REAL advocacy from the police for domestic violence, even with all the evidence in the world and they just drag their feet. I mean the violent incident with the gun happened almost a year ago! Where is the JUSTICE in this system of ours?! I hope to find some soon, starting with Wednesday. But I’m JUST SO SCARED to have to see him again!"
anxiety,I've heard Xanax is similar except I don't want to risk dying from having some other stuff in it cause I couldn't obtain it legally. What other options do I have? (Just to clarify: I'm at my wit's end. I just need something to get me through certain days. I recognise the risk of addiction and that it's not a long-term fix.)
ptsd,"Post contains spoilers for Spider-Man : Homecoming. I was the first responder to a fatal plane crash in Australia in January 2017, and have been dealing with my PTSD since then. I’ve been lucky to avoid most triggers now I’m back in the UK, but watching Spider-Man tonight there’s a scene where a plane crashes into a beach, and my mind is all over the place with my heart rate through the roof. If anyone has any suggestions for how to deal with this please do say, I haven’t been in therapy for a while x"
ptsd,"I just need to get this off my chest with people who will get it. I can't stand being in this situation where I feel like my reaction to something could be coming from the PTSD in which case it was an overreaction, or if the thing done to me was actually shitty and the reaction was warranted. Or some sort of combination of both. I can't see other options. I just have ended up feeling guilty for self-advocacy because I have this internalized feeling (only just now realizing I have this) from my past that he was right, I am just crazy and needy and the abuse was justified."
ptsd,"Hey guys I have PTSD from years of emotional abuse and neglect by my narcissistic parents. I am living in their house again now due to some financial hardships (Im 22), I am constantly being triggered and am experiencing intensified symptoms. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this situation? I feel completely trapped, I need to figure out how to manage these symptoms because they're really getting in the way of my functioning. Sorry for the lack of detail/emotion but I am so drained."
ptsd,"So my brothers wedding is soon. Like very very soon. My fiance recently lost their job and we had to move and then a bunch of medical drama happened. I told him I would do everything I could to get there, I am honestly not sure if I want to go to prove I can, just because I care for my brother or because I am not being smart and compassionate enough to say no to myself. But there I was dead set on going, despite the obvious problems and the advice from the majority of the people everywhere I go that I should not go."
ptsd,"I hate this feeling. I hate weddings, but I want to be there to support them... but I can't. <url> &#x200B; edited; For clarity"
ptsd,"I regret signing up for class especially this  math class. I feel so pathetic I may drop out again. im so anxious in class, it is so long about 6 hours since it supposed to be help special type of class to pass a placement test since I failed that. I halfway made it to my second week. I cant take it anymore."
ptsd,"Anything from elbowing someone in the face to completely letting loose with a knife or a baseball bat. It can be mildly amusing for a moment, but I find it actually calls up a distress response more than anything else. I start to feel my head ache, my shoulderblades become taut and sore, and my throat close. My heart rate also increases and my breathing becomes somewhat more laboured. I know this is unhealthy, and I will be addressing it with my therapist, however I was hoping to  get some input from fellow reddit users with PTSD."
ptsd,They work together and I found out from a mutual friend that they're on a project together and I'm having difficulty handling it. ​ I am seeing a therapist. I am practicing self help. But this sort of thing is affecting me immensely.
ptsd,"Everyday I have to wake up and choose to push forward & live or fall apart & die. Lately, it's been really hard to push forward & live. I'm tired you guys. I am so tired. What do I do?"
anxiety,"Has anyone dealt with urinary retention as a side effect of lexapro? I've been taking lexapro for like 2 weeks or so, and in the past week it has become very difficult to pee, even at home (it sometimes takes a lot of pushing, and my bladder never feels like it's truly empty.). And the more I have to go, the harder it is, so I try to go often, like every 30 mintues or hour or so (even at night). I can barely eat or drink anything anymore. I did some research and it appears that urinary retention could be a side affect of lexapro."
anxiety,"I'm 14 years old going in highschool. I've had anxiety, mostly health anxiety my entire life. But it usually only lasted a day at times and my anxiety only when off it certain, not daily things now I suffer daily and want it gone. I've posted here before but just want to know what you guys think of this, recently someone passed away in there sleep from a heart attack and now I'm anxious like never before. I'll wake up with panic attacks and such."
anxiety,"As I kid, I had been pretty anxious and nervous, but they were negligible. I only got anxious when there was something happening, like giving presentation etc. They did not tamper with my everyday life and I was not concerned with them. But recently, I felt like my anxiety has developed into a new level. I got so damn anxious for every day stuff."
ptsd,As of Sunday i have experience sever anxiety. Its too the point i am unable to do normal everyday functions and doing my job is harder. All i can think about is how i was ripped away from my daughter and how she is without me. Its to the point my therapist uas suggested i used cbd oil to manage my anxiety instead of narcotics. They help take the edge off and let me relax to the point i can sleep.
anxiety,"So in the past two weeks, I’ve been supporting my dad through some mental health things, I’ve been having trouble at work, my Nanna got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and to top it off, my boyfriend broke up with me two days ago.I work full time and I’m also at uni, which I’m falling behind in. Whatever I do, I cannot concentrate on anything and just fall into an absolute panic when I have a second to think. I feel so nauseous that I can’t eat. And I’m bursting into tears randomly. Can you suggest some coping strategies that you use to stop the constant cycle of negative thoughts?"
stress,I doubt and second guess myself a lot. I hesitate and fear picking up the phone. Fear coming off as too aggressive or too pushy or not sending the right person and Err On the side of not being aggressive enough. I’m afraid to take control as I fear ruining relationships etc. Last year i still did surprisingly well despite all this and even earned a rookie of the year title and won a trip.
ptsd,"Then I came home.      My Mom pointed it out first, I went from being the class clown and the life of the party, to being the quiet guy who stood in the corner of the room. I went from a musician and avid gamer, to having no interest in any of it, and no replacement hobby. The things I had the most passion for in life were gone. It was like someone removed one of my five senses and my soul at the same time."
ptsd,When my SO and I first started dating and she told me she had PTSD I though just being a good guy would be enough. Well just being a good guy is not enough when your with someone with PTSD. You can still trigger them even though you are a good guy. You can still get offended when they tell you they can't trust you even though it is the PTSD talking and not them. You feel like a failure when they tell you they feel hopeless and that nobody can help them.
anxiety,"It is having a major strain on our relationship as he obviously wants to be involved but essentially I am unloading all my worry onto him. I am really unsure how to move forwards from here. If I think I am being irrational and hold in my anxiety, he says I am not communicating with him about it. If I open up and tell him, I feel like I am a burden and it makes me feel guilty and pretty low that I'm feeling this way. Any advice would be appreciated!"
ptsd,I screamed and my mum helped me until I passed out. I went to the doctor the next day and they referred me on to get a diagnosis for PTSD as well. I get flashies about once every couple of months now and it gets more and more terrifying each time. About a year and a half before GCSE's (finals for you Americans) my anxiety started to show. I would be super stressed about every little test in school and had a baseline amount of stress building up as I got closer to my exam dates.
ptsd,"But here i am, hours later, having a panic attack and wishing i could crawl out of my skin. It's really triggering a sense memory i have, so instead of remembering the event, it feels like it's happening right now. It is the most devastating ending to this day that could have possibly happened. I was feeling so brave lately. Does anyone else get sense memories?"
ptsd,"It may have been those emotional mute buttons that PTSD can sometimes press? I don't know. But recently I suddenly have all these flare-ups of anger that I don't really know what to do with. It takes every ounce of my being to control myself sometimes, and I feel lucky that I have been able to keep things relatively under control. I do occasionally do little things I'm not proud of, and I'm worried this will be a problem if I don't know any coping strategies."
ptsd,And how I made her let me bring him back to her boyfriends house. How I begged him to come over. And how she was just trying to be a good person and discourage it. She's telling people how much I wanted him to fuck me. How RELENTLESS I was.
ptsd,I just don't know what's real anymore. I can't live with everyone in my life thinking that I'm crazy AND a hysterical slut. I just can't do this anymore. I'm so ashamed I can't be in this skin anymore. I'm starting to get scared.
anxiety,Am I mentally ill? I want to kill myself but I'm to scared to even do that. I'm supposed to be starting college in the fall but I don't think that'll work out well. This entire post is probably gibberish but I haven't slept in almost 2 days and I can't think straight. I don't know what to do but I can't keep doing this.
anxiety,"So something happened over 3 years ago that caused me a tremendous amount of anxiety, and over the past few months the anxiety surrounding that event has come back? It doesn't make sense, I can't rationalize it either. This time around it's not as intense as it was then but I'm definitely experiencing the same thoughts, same anxiety. What the f do I do? I don't feel comfortable at all talking about it with a therapist and it's began consuming my life again."
ptsd,"My PTSD has manifested itself in disassociation, flashbacks, panic attacks and general anxiety and depression. I believe that my PTSD is related to my previous abusive relationship also, sexual assault, traumatic childhood experiences and an alcoholic parent. I am looking for any advice related to these issues that may help me learn to manage them. I am currently seeing a therapist and going through CBT and I mediate regularly as well. Any suggestions or resources would be greatly appreciated!"
anxiety,"Every single day I think about what happened, and it scares me to this very day. My hands go numb all the time with loss of sensation and my muscles are tense 24/7 I have a hard time believing it's anxiety but it most likely is because I've never had panic attacks before that incident. I've been on one antidepressant (Zoloft) for 3 months, and it didn't do anything. I was prescribed Venlafaxine but I'm too scared to take it due to the side effects. So yeah that's my story"
anxiety,"I have no clue. I meditate twice daily, jog every morning, eat very healthy, absolutely love my life and am following my passion. Yet I’m struck with random physical anxiety all the time. No negative thoughts or anything like that, it’s purely physical. A very uncomfortable feeling in my chest."
anxiety,"So im feeling a bit defeated; I finally went to my dr at the beginning of last month about my PPD and anxiety, also my workplace is very stressful and my marriage feels like it's crumbling because we are always arguing... my dr prescribed me Zoloft, I really wish now I had journaled how it made me feel, but thinking back, I had some nausea and then started to feel anxiety relief within a week, and overall better mood in a few weeks. Last week, I was working nights and forgot to take my Zoloft four days in a row... I went into a crisis/withdrawal, started taking it again and on day three I felt AWFUL. I went to a walkin because my dr was away that day. She prescribed me Paxil, to start at 10mg and then increase it to 20 after a week."
ptsd,"I'm not sure...? I'm stressed to high heaven, and I know that this is the core of it. I don't believe in god, or I dunno... but I am terrified of facing this portion of myself? Like Someone with a phobia of something. But I need this part in my life."
ptsd,"I get intrusive memories, that are really hard to get out of my head, sometimes I actually flashback like I'm there. I have nightmares that replay old memories of me as a child, or sometimes of just her face. But it doesn't happen everyday. This is the first time I've really thought about frequency, I'll catch myself actively trying to avoid thinking about certain things. I stay away from where I used to live with her, every time I go to that town I have a panic attack."
stress,"I get so stressed at work. I feel like women get all the preferential treatment. Also, the few women who are in charge just spend their time micro\-managing the men while letting the other females just slide by doing minimal work. I don't get it. It causes me huge stress because I feel like im living in an unfair world and I don't know what to do about it."
anxiety,"I have just recently got on anxiety medication again because it’s been going downhill recently (my boss knows this, we have more of a friendship than boss/employee relationship) I really just want to up and quit because I make shit money and I feel myself declining but I also know once I pass over this rough patch I’ll need this job because I’ll have to move out I’m sure. I want to text her and tell her I’m taking the week off for mental health reasons, is this not okay? For all I know I’ll wake up in the morning and just not go. I feel like shit right now and know I won’t feel any better by morning or in a few days. I’m just lost."
ptsd,*potential triggers: abuse* I was recently diagnosed with PTSD and have been prescribed Cymbalta. Since taking the drug I have found that my flashbacks have kind of intensified. I can now taste things and smell things whereas before it would just be a scene that played out it's like I'm THERE every time. I keep having urges to call my abusers and other people that were involved and tell them that I remember the truth now and I don't forgive them.
ptsd,She starts to cry and apologize as well as tell me that it was all her fault regardless how many times I try to convince her otherwise. As her boyfriend it's extremely painful to watch. On our ride home from the store today she had another breakdown that lasted until we got into the house. However that's when things took a turn for the worse. She had an extremely severe panic attack.
anxiety,"An hour ago I felt like I was having stroke like symptoms, but they passed so maybe it was a panic attack. Now I'm just very lightheaded. I am hoping when I get my ultrasound and my work issue is resolved (both next week), all this will pass and I can chalk it up to anxiety...but I'm not sure and am terrified. Has anyone with anxiety experienced these kinds of symptoms? I feel like I'm not going to make it until next week at this rate."
anxiety,"-when talking to someone i get out of breath easily while talking (newest one) -can't sit properly, I have to sit in a weird position or else its really uncomfortable -easily startled (for example, im sitting in my room, watching youtube and all of a sudden someone opens the door and I get startled) in general im really not a easy to scare person, but this is ridicilous.. Im wondering if I can get rid of these symptoms, if its possible, sometimes I think that im neck deep in this anxiety that there is no way back to 100% normal... but then again sometimes I tell myself everything will be good again. So yea, some tips ,similar experiences / symptoms / if and how did you get rid of them are gladly appreciated:) Thanks !"
ptsd,"I look in the mirror and all I see is fat, even though I'm smaller than a lot of people. Secondly, my sister decided to let my ex, who I broke up with, move in with her, and his new boyfriend. She intentionally told my brother not to tell me about the situation, and then she says that I wouldn't be upset if I didn't love him still. I'm not upset because I still love him. I'm upset because she's my sister."
stress,"It's really just standard-issue big corporation stuff. My direct manager slaps together the scheduling for our dept. at the last minute because she's overworked, and she's overworked because it's cheaper to make her do enough work for 2/3 people than to just open up an assistant position. I'm not getting enough sleep. I'm going off my medication because I can't make the appointments I need; my weekly schedule is a complete dice roll."
anxiety,"That was about 7 hours ago. Normally, I do not get much effect from tea because I only ever drink half a cup as I don't like it that much. However, I have been feeling jittery all day and my heart periodically feels as though it is racing. I have that adrenalized and uneasy feeling that I always get with caffeine. It wasn't really bothering me because I knew it was probably from the caffeine."
anxiety,"I tried everything at work, from doing meditation, office yoga, to getting a board to keep track of my tasks. Everyday seemed overwhelming, and I slowly started dreading my patient appointments and sometimes rushed through them because I could sense a panic attack coming on. To make matters worse, my supervisor is not the most understanding person. English is not her first language, and it's sometimes very hard to communicate with her in person or in email. I meet with her twice a month to discuss my progress and she never gives me positive feedback, only highlights things I've done wrong and things I don't do."
anxiety,"Well maybe afraid isn't the best word, but it's not far off. I'm not worried they can physically harm me or anything, nor do I even hate kids, most kids I actually like, but certain kids, like uncle's girlfriend's one kids, make me uncomfortable and make my anxiety go off badly. He's like 6 or something like that, but he is disrespectful to me, and harasses me when I'm around. He'll make smart ass remarks which although typical small child insults, get to me, not because they hurt my feelings so much, but it gets to me that I'm so pathetic, I can't even demand respect from a fucking child. Today, playing some backyard cricket with my brother and other cousin (a very respectful kid who I love), he asks if he can peg the ball at my groin, to which I obviously say no, so what does he do?"
anxiety,"Switching my major to something I’d actually enjoy would add in years to my education and everyone would be like “wtf you need to just commit and finish it because of the money you’ve paid and time etc” because it’s not like I’m 22 anymore or whatever. But I dream of a career involved in science, something morbid or outdoors. I feel like I’m too old to be indecisive. I want to start a family in the next couple f years but if I switch up this career stuff that’ll just push it back and I am almost 30 after all! :/"
anxiety,"As a high school junior, I'm always severely depressed whenever I make poor grades on something to the extent I'm always on the verge of crying. Every time this happens, I always feel like my future is bleak and hopeless, my rank is gonna drop like hell, and I'm worthless compared to the other people who do better than me. I'm always driven to think lesser of myself in comparison to other people and I always hate myself because of it. Now the pain is becoming unbearable to the point I nearly start screaming, sobbing alone in my bedroom out of grief. It's only the beginning of my junior year and I feel like hell has already descended upon me and there's little I can actually do."
ptsd,"My job is very difficult to get, I know multiple people who drive two hours each way because it is the best job around (midwest). It isn't one I can just give up but every time he gets close I start to panic and I can't breathe. My anxiety is through the roof. The worst part is he tries to hit on me and it honestly makes me sick. Add in that I'm pregnant and my hormones are through the roof, I just don't know what to do any advice?"
anxiety,"I recovered somewhat after a few hours but somethings changed now; I cant be alone without constantly feeling like Im on the verge of another attack. When my fiance is home Im perfectly fine, but as soon as she leaves for work (I work from home) I start to feel terrified, my feet and hands start sweating, I feel like Im about to be sick, I get lightheaded and I feel like I become wayyyy too conscious of my breathing to the point where I focus on it and it feels like no matter how much I exhale and inhale Im not actually breathing. I dont understand why this is happening....Ive never had issues being alone; now I cant even be alone in my own home. This feels like my life is ruined if I dont get it under control because I cant work like this. What the hell is happening?"
anxiety,"It's hard for me to even type this, but today I dropped my classes after only a week of school. I've been in school for a while, just got my associate's degree in liberal arts at a community college and was planning on going to university for an English degree. I will note that the majority of my classes were online as I can't focus in an in-person class due to my social anxiety. However, I panicked about my future and how English isn't a ""lucrative"" field and changed gears. I enrolled in a program that was for Physical Therapy Assisting."
anxiety,"I constantly cancel plans on friends because sometimes going out is just too much. I recently heard about a friend of a friend who passed away at 25 from breast cancer and instead of empathy or sympathy, all I could feel was terrified fear that I would get diagnosed with the same cancer that she had. That was all I could think about - and that always happens when I hear about someone else dying. Ugh. I don't even know."
anxiety,Exercise has helped in the past with my anxiety but since I have been having my recent dealings of anxiety I have been finding it harder to get active. A triggering factor of my anxiety over the last few weeks has been an increased heart rate. Sometimes if I stand up too fast/run up the stairs my heart starts pounding and then my mind spirals into the fear of a heart attack and my heart beat just keeps increasing till the point of anxiety. I have been taking walks and my heart rate would increase (naturally) and I would get the fear and my fears would multiple till the point when I would be close to a panic attack. I would like to start riding my bike again or working out in general but I am afraid of:
anxiety,"I've read that quality sleep, regular exercise, and fish oil all can help. Does that sound right? What are the best, non-pharma methods to help resolve anxiety? What about mediation (and is there a suggested starting point)? While I'm probably genetically more prone to anxiety, is it that I've let my body down somehow?"
anxiety,"It was hard to function I didn't used to be like this though. **Is there a road back to normalcy? **  I want my life back. I guess I'll start doping myself up with Escitalopram for now, but I'd rather it not become a crutch."
anxiety,I’m leaving for the airport right now and i’m so fucking scared. I’ve been nauseous all day and already puked like 4 times even though i haven’t had anything to eat since yesterday. I will have to check my bags in and talk to the attendant and then go through security without holding up the queue. And then sit inches away from a stranger on the plane. At least I have a window seat.
anxiety,"Tomorrow I bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. I'm heartbroken and I will be speaking at his funeral. I am happy with the speech but I am nervous, petrified to mess up. He was an incredible guy and I want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how I have been doing and if I ever needed anything go to her."
anxiety,"Hi, everyone! Just a warning, kind of a long story, as you can probably tell from the paragraph. So my relationship with anxiety has always been a thing, at least from what I remember from childhood (undiagnosed OCD). But recently my anxiety has gotten worse, no thanks to unfortunate events over the past few years involving 3 family deaths and the loss of a childhood home and pets. While I have always been kind of an anxious person, I have upgraded (downgraded?)"
anxiety,"I worry that if I sit around too often, I will develop blood clots and die. Anything to do with death really. On top of that, I have been developing intrusive thoughts. But the worst part is that last week I was laying in bed and randomly became afraid that I was going to lose my sense of reality and start hallucinating. I have never hallucinated in my life (unless you count the 2 times that I tried psychedelics) and have never had this fear before but it scared the shit out of me."
stress,"We had 2 classes together, so we spent a few hours together most days working through problem sets. This next semester, I won't even have that. I'll probably be in more isolation this time around. Any tips are appreciated. Thanks!"
ptsd,"Lately I have started having some unusual episodes. \### Introduction I  have never had flashbacks as far as I know, but I was always upset every time somebody unexpectedly grabbed me, or worse, inflicted me some pain,  even if accidentally. If I saw that coming, than OK, but if not, I was  instantly teleported to a very bad place, emotionally. I was not  experiencing something I could call flashbacks, but there sure were very dark, painful and overwhelming feelings."
ptsd,"Not really sure why I'm posting this but just for my own sanity I suppose, to say something this beats just going into the woods and screaming at trees which I feel like doing often. I have PTSD ,chronic depression, anxiety the whole circus of fun from my time in the Army (15 years). I feel like im on the verge of a psychotic breakdown, literally almost all of the time. Im either so depressed I can hardly move, have little energy and general fatigue OR im so angry I could kill everyone around me. There was a line on a tv show (Vikings) where the main character says ""I feel like im always torn between killing myself, or everyone else""."
ptsd,"It seems that as of now our best option is just to babysit her for the weekend until she can see a doctor on Monday. Which really, really fucks my weekend, but so be it. FINAL UPDATE: Thanks for all the support, friends. We did end up calling emergency responders for her about twelve hours after my last edit. She was going full-bore psychotic, and it was getting to the point where I was no longer sure she wouldn't attempt to harm herself."
anxiety,"I developed some health problems with my stomach around September of last year and had to be hospitalized, had very high wbc, did a cat scan and so on. They let me go with some antibiotics and no answer about what was wrong with me. This, I guess, left me feeling very nervous, the next time I was researching my pains and such and blah blah everything online telling me I’m going to die. So I turn off my phone and I’m lying there trying to sleep when i get this sudden gasping feeling and like I can’t breathe. I feel completely overwhelmed by it, my face and hands feel numb, I wake up my family and we wait maybe an hour before taking me to the hospital."
ptsd,"Eventually my vision started to fade and I started losing feeling in my hands and feet. My mind started to wander off to things other than my struggle for air, and one thought stuck with me ""the sun is really bright and warm on my face."" With that thought, I closed my eyes tight and felt the strength starting to leave my arms. I felt my chest and abdomen twitching trying to expand and pull in air and I thought to myself, ""I'm going to die. I don't want to die."""
ptsd,"Typing is keeping me from facing my terror. The nightmares have mostly subsided, but without my wife keeping the ghost away, I'm scared the dreams will come back. I keep recalling the most vivid one of them, it replays itself over and over in my head. I've seen many therapists over the years, and sadly none of them have any understanding of what I'm going through, or how to treat it. Their answer is drug me up until I'm numbed to the point where I no longer feel human."
anxiety,"Just a simple ""seen"" status can get me into a deep downward spiral of anxiety that suppresses my hunger, takes away my will to do anything, makes me nauseous, takes away my sleep. As soon as the person texts back, I immediately feel okay. I've had relationships with girls that I've felt this way. Both times it was long term and both times I ended it. I somehow find a way to ignore every good thing I had thought before and find all that I feel she misses on other girls."
anxiety,I had a pretty creepy experience almost a week ago. I've never had a hallucination like that. So disconnected and vivid and super weird. I was anxious because I was in a building filled with people. Then all of a sudden I hallucinated where I was in a dark room all by myself.
ptsd,"I get it, people collect guns as a hobby, this is america. When I saw it I immediately panicked because when I was with one of my abusive exes he bought an AR-15 really close to the end of our relationship and would do things like take it apart and put it back together over and over again in front of me and keep it loaded in our bed and I’ve been terrified of guns of all kinds ever since. I can’t even use a staple gun. This new guy and I just talking and haven’t decided to go on a date yet but it might go that way. Is this something that I’m panicking about because of my past or should I really be concerned?"
anxiety,"I went to the ER recently because it reached 100 bpm and wouldn’t go down but in retrospect it’s because I was reinforcing my anxiety by numbers high, it won’t go down, oh shit number’s higher and it won’t go down. Repeat. I turned off heart rate tracking and fitness tracking. It’s a shame because I feel it’s turning off a valuable part of the device but quantifiable health data has become one of my triggers. If x to x+5 is a healthy range I freak at x+6 etc."
ptsd,"I can't go into public restrooms because I freak out and dissociate with my surroundings. I can't watch certain shows because they were -on- in the hospital room. But I'm doubting myself, I'm doubting that this is real, that it happened and that I could be suffering from it. How to cope? how to stop doubting that this is happening?"
ptsd,"i don’t bother with people and frequently ghost them or cancel plans last minute whereas before i was a very loving and sociable person. i generally don’t trust anybody, and i fret that people i am very close to are secretly horrid and manipulative and going to stab me in the back. so basically, my reactions to the world have regressed back to as if i were still there and interacting with those people. all this began to develop months after i left that bad situation. for ages i was normal."
ptsd,"and i still feel like im on meth 5 days later after sleeping less then 10 hours total over that time. im also going in and out of depersonalization and derealization when it gets really bad, and when i haven't done the twitch for a few hours I can start feeling really tired and depressed like my body needs to rest, only to do it again and instantly be jacked up and on a speed high again. this is honestly the most fucked up situation i could ever imagine and can  barely believe its even happening its so fucked up. literally feels like a bad dream. Please help"
ptsd,"I am scared as fuck off what the comedown is going to be like from being jacked up on adrenaline for 5 days straight. I have not felt tired whatsoever during this time. I have been giving valium and trazadone to sleep, by an emerg psyciatrist, of which I cannot feel either whatsoever. On top of that when I do this twitch many times in a row, i can actually see and feel my entire veins/circulatory system constricting down very small. they have been in a state of permenant constriction for 4 days now."
anxiety,"I am absolutely terrified that the repairs are going to eat up my savings/any credit card wiggle room I’ve created. Based on what came on and how my car drove (it was pretty much fine with no weird noises, movements or anything strange), I’d say it’s unlikely but I am very, very scared. I’ve worked very hard to hold onto my money and make sure I had cushions in place in case of emergencies like this. Please, if anyone has any advice for how to keep myself calm and not panic until Monday, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you."
ptsd,"The terrifying part happened later in the day. I was very fragile, and when my roommate asked me why I was so solemn, I broke down crying. I excused myself to the bathroom, where I continued to cry and try to get a hold of myself. What killed me is when I stood up, I thought, ""I'm a different person. I am not [my name]."""
ptsd,The last straw that broke me completely happened the night before/early morning of St Patty's day 2013 (age 21). I went to a bar for a pre-party. I had one shot with the bartender and some other guys there. I then started drinking water and talking to the guy sitting next to me. He said he was a pilot.
ptsd,"I would like to reach out for help from someone supportive before an episode becomes too intense to ask for help. I would like to acknowledge the symptoms and temporary nature of the situation as to let it pass without causing additional damage. I finally realized that fighting my traumatic episodes is like a rigid oak tree trying to resist a flooding dam. Do any of you guys have ways to be ""okay"" with an episode? If so, how do you find the flexibility and patience to not fight against it?"
ptsd,"I couldn’t stop shaking and now I can’t get her out of my head. I keep looking at the sides of the road any time I drive now. I don’t even know how this triggered my ptsd since mine normally is only triggered by losing my breath or having a heavy feeling in my lungs. Does anyone have any tips on how I can stop worrying about this again? If anyone’s wondering, I can’t remember much but I remember pulling over in a parking lot, calling 911, and passing out from a severe anxiety attack."
anxiety,"Okay so I've got anxiety disorder and depression and went to doctors and they prescribed me Zofolt. I'm on my third week (20 days of medication first week 25g next 2 weeks 50g) keep this in mind that I have never token any SSRI before and Zofolt was my first anyway it's been quite tough I guess. I've noticed I've been experiencing Depersonalisation or Dereality or whatever it's called lately and I'm pretty sure it's from the medication, I can't really remember in the past if I've ever had DR OR DP so I'm not sure if Zofolt has caused it, I would be able to fight through it if it is just a TEMPORARY side effect but i was wondering if it's permanent. I hope not because it is really weird and strange and I feel like I'm going insane!"
ptsd,"And now that they have been living separately I had to move back in with my dad (after I couldn’t afford college) and he’s gotten to the point that he won’t even clean up after his dog so the house smells of urine or clean his clothes and all he does is play video games and yell at people. He will smoke weed and go to work and come home and never clean his dishes or anything. He’s turned into this monster who doesn’t care about anyone and will get rid of everyone if they inconvenience him even a little and he’s obsessed with money and making music. Now I have these bad nights a lot when people poke at me about my past, since today someone poked fun at me about an identity issue I used to have and now I’m just in a horrible place. It feels like anxiety is slowly pulling me into my bed."
anxiety,"I was talking to my counselor today about my anxiety disorder, and he suggested to me that I try to reframe my anxiety as excitement, as they cause the same adrenal response. He suggested I view this adrenal response as simply “emotional arousal to something something novel.” This conversation caused me to have the revelation that for at least the past 5 years, I haven’t been able to experience anything “exciting” as something other than anxiety inducing. Things like first dates, roller coasters, etc. are all miserable for me because of my heightened nervous response."
anxiety,"With the help of my therapist, I've come to somewhat of a revelation. I have a very hard time feeling a sense of accomplishment, especially for ""little"" things throughout the day. Obviously something like applying for a few jobs (I'm unemployed) isn't going to give anybody the same sense of accomplishment as something like earning a college degree. But I have a hard time not feeling like I should have applied for more, I'm still being lazy, a normal person would have done more, etc. Which in turn is making me feel like crap and leading me to apply for even less jobs and get less done."
stress,"she then tells me i’m self centered and i’m a fuck up and i’m fucking my sister up. And once everything has been said 10 mins later she acts like she did none of it. she asks me if i want tea and to watch tv with her. this all probably sounds so confusing but it’s mentally making me lose it. i cant do this anymore, i can’t balance school and my personal issues and family issues and her altogether."
stress,"i’m 15, i don’t want to be anywhere near my dad bc of the shit he’s done and this has been going on for 4 years now. she also claims i give her an attitude anytime i do something. today i took the pair of shorts to fold and she looked at me and said “ are you really gonna grab them like that? your a fucking asshole. your giving me an attitude after all this shit?"
stress,"she asks me if i want tea and to watch tv with her. this all probably sounds so confusing but it’s mentally making me lose it. i cant do this anymore, i can’t balance school and my personal issues and family issues and her altogether. what do i do?? plz?"
anxiety,Lately I've just been having that terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach and also a feeling of nausea \- like I constantly need to throw up. I'm sleeping normal but still feeling so tired and drained and can't really focus at work \- and because of that I feel like my work performance is slipping up. I am constantly afraid that I'm going to lose my job and that my manager hates me. This has been happening so much more frequently. About a week ago my doc gave me prozac (once a day) and xanax (only as needed) prescriptions and I feel like it's helped with the bigger attacks and some dark thoughts but now its almost like just a little constant anxiety all the time and it sucks.
ptsd,"I've got a good handle on my triggers. I know how to prepare myself when I have to encounter a trigger and how to move past it without too much discomfort. That being said today I encountered an event that blindsided me. I was not prepared at all. I know its possible I will come across triggers without warning, but this was something that had not been a trigger before."
stress,"I have panic attack after panic attack and I truly just don't know what to do anymore. No matter how I explain the severity of my situation to people, they STILL somehow seem to not understand just how miserable my mind makes me everyday. I get intrusive thoughts like about how something terrible could happen to my family, or a lot of ""what ifs"". My mind is running 24/7 and it's driving me insane. I have a terrible fear of dying along with an even more crippling fear of something happening to my family (my parents, brothers..) all day long my mind plays thoughts and scenarios that leave me sad, scared, constantly wired with fear, and over all exhausted."
anxiety,"I read somewhere that feeling like you can't swallow is a symptom of anxiety. It usually only happens when I take pills, but lately it's expanded to nearly everything I eat or drink. It helps if I'm moving or fidgeting with something, but my family has started noticing. It makes me avoid eating with others when I can, or just eating super slow. It's become a fear of choking or asphyxiating  now."
anxiety,"I keep getting this... creeping/moving feeling in my stomach. Right below where my ribs part, maybe slightly to the right. I have no idea what it is but I've never had stomach issues with my anxiety. It just started in the past couple of weeks. Admittedly my anxiety has been a lot worse lately."
ptsd,"I hadn't realized until a year ago, but this gave me ptsd and shaped the way I interact with men and boys. Now I'm dating a boy who is very sweet, very understanding and such, but I often find myself thinking about ending it because his behavior feels too ""man-ish"" to me, and it makes me uncomfortable and scares me. It puts me in a very irritated state - a response to feeling threatened by men in my case - and often starts ""discourse"" between us. Luckily he is very understanding and we talked about it a lot, but whenever he asks me what he's doing that makes me uncomfortable, I can't answer, I can't put it into words, which means he can't change his behavior perfectly and that the cycle will start over again. I'm fighting as hard as I can against the effects of my ptsd on my relationship, as it is very important to me to make it work, but I know when we end it, it will be partly caused by it."
anxiety,"Alright so, for my entire life I've been a straight-A student. High honor roll every time. I never expected any less and neither did my parents, teachers, friends, etc. Over the past year (8th grade) I've developed anxiety, depression, and OCD. (Not self diagnosed.)"
anxiety,"I am still rather lacking in social skills. Writing this is gradually helping me calm down. Does anybody else feel this way too? Several years ago I just gave up on life, not in the way suicidal people do, but, I just stopped putting in any effort to achieve any goals or plans since it wasn’t working, I stopped standing up for myself or resisting other people, I stopped doing anything that was hard or required effort or that caused me emotional pain, that triggered panic attacks. Not because I wanted to die but because I wanted to live, to live a life free of those burdens."
anxiety,"It is quite annoying. I get diarrhea when I get panic attacks and then need to shower thoroughly to get myself cleaned up because it is disgusting. I also get hypochondriac thoughts and sometimes panic so badly I call 911 and have an ambulance sent. Thankfully I have not done that today. This is so annoying, this fight-or-flight response."
anxiety,"My best friend died last year, of a rare type of bacteria that killed him very quickly, a contagious disease. He was a year younger than me. I am still relatively young but also starting to get old, my age is in between somewhere. I can feel the medicine starting to work and I am not as anxious now. I have been typing for over half an hour."
anxiety,"So to the point, I’m almost 30 and I’m starting to think maybe I *am* this anxious person who says stupid things and gives off the ‘Don’t mess with me’ vibe I apparently give off when I’m anxious. I’m painfully awkward. I unintentionally say really rude things and I don’t even realize it until way later. I’m socially inept and it’s frustrating that all this work I’ve continually been doing for my mental health has been for nothing. I feel like I should just succumb to accepting that the good times are few and far between and this person I am when I’m unstable mentally is just who I am."
anxiety,"I picked at it yesterday and made it worse. What do I do about this? I'm still convinced there's something there but nothing I've tried has worked. I've tried flossing and even using a small needle to dislodge whatever I _think_ is in there but it still hurts long after it's healed and it still bothers me like crazy. FYI I have trich and dermo as symptoms of OCD, anxiety, and body dysmorphia and is the main reason why I pick at myself"
ptsd,"My car broke. Again massive stress, helplessness, and hopelessness, as if the walls are closing in on me. I knew a bit of mechanic work and decided to fix the car myself. After a few weeks of investigation, learning, part orders, etc, etc I did fix it. But it wasted a lot of my time though."
anxiety,"Yep, you read the title correctly. I get anxiety from my dog, more specifically leaving my dog alone for extended periods of time. I got him when he was a puppy and at the time I lived at home with four other humans and my parents two dogs. We all worked different schedules so he wasn't left alone very often, and even when we were all gone there were other dogs their with him. A little over a year and a half ago my bf and I moved in together and my dog had some really bad separation anxiety at first."
anxiety,I've had major brain fog all day and I've been out of it all day now because of how anxious I am about how bad of a job I did and how much I embarrassed myself by crying at my desk. I work in a high pressure job and I know other people have done it but I would love to have thicker skin. &#x200B; Do anyone else cry as an immediate reaction to anything negative? Does anyone have a way to cope when your anxiety manifests like that?
ptsd,"CW: mentions of self-harm, suicide I feel so overwhelmed. The flashbacks, the panic attacks, being triggered so easily, sometimes by mere words alone. I get so entrenched in my flashbacks that I can barely medicate myself, and my friend has to intervene and give me a good dose of clonazepam to get me out of it. I can't talk about my trauma, it sends me straight into a state of anxiety and panic."
ptsd,"I have very strong urges to hurt myself. I've been self-harming for over six years. Sometimes I think that all I need is a good deep cut. Other times, I honestly feel like ending my life. I can't handle this constant state of hypervigilance and all the intrusive memories."
ptsd,"I don't have PTSD, I know how debilitating it is for you guys who do, but I thought I'd post in here because you might be aware of the symptoms and see if there's any connection? Basically I used to be severely bullied back in school and I've never gotten over it. I have nightmares, and even like ""day-mares"", where something somebody does or says makes me remember something that happened, suddenly, and it makes me lose all concentration as I just stare into space remembering the event. Sometimes they're recurring, sometimes they pop out of some dark corner of my mind, where all the oppressed memories are. I've never fully recovered, and I've only recently got to a place where nobody takes the piss out of me for some reason or another."
ptsd,"On a side note, the mere idea of my significant other interacting in any way, hostile or friendly, with my brother makes me wanna freak the fuck out, so there’s also that. (But it doesn’t take much for me to wanna freak out either). Should I just continue to struggle privately to put this all behind me somehow? Also, is it selfish to feel the need to distance myself from my family right now while I’m trying to finally heal? (Like, moving far away so I have a non-hurtful excuse to only see them once every couple years).."
anxiety,"I have GAD with obsessive thoughts ( ocd) that are health related ( hypochondria ) And I am 18, I have been single my whole life, have never had a girlfriend or a kiss or anything of the sort. In elementary school I liked 4 girls throughout my time there and they all just ended up as friends and I never confessed my feelings. In middle school I liked the same girl for 2 years who rejected me. Then I liked two more girls, one who ended up as a friend and another moved. Now in high school I’ve liked about 11 girls, and no luck at ALL with any of them."
anxiety,"I have a presentation to give on Wednesday as part of my Biology course. It's by myself and I've already jumped to ""would it be so bad if I didn't do it?"" because the thought of doing it feels worse than missing out on 20% towards the module... I can't see my doctor before then because there's no appointments and I tried getting an appointment with the counselling service that uni offers but they haven't got back to me yet. My heart races every time I think about it."
ptsd,"I’m going to be posting something similar in the anxiety subreddit too but I wanted to talk to you guys about this too. I was formally diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety last year. I’m on medications for this too. I’ve been having a rough week. I haven’t been able to sleep and any sleep I’ve had has been very rough, just the complete opposite of restful."
ptsd,"It’s been 12 hours since it’s started and I genuinely can’t get it to stop. It’s been so bad that my tongue is actually really starting to hurt. Has this happened to anyone else before? ? I hope I explained that clearly enough but if you need more descriptions, let me know and I can try to explain it better."
anxiety,"I don't know why this happened, but I use to have these really bad panic attacks up until about a decade ago. Since then I've been having what feels like one long one. For 9 years I've been in a constant state of panic. It's not as severe as the full blown ones but I'm always short of breath, jittery, with an increased heart rate, a bit warm and super aware of my surroundings. At times I feel like I'm one loud noise away from pulling a seizure or losing consciousness and if I take my mind off my breathing I would stop."
anxiety,"aaaa sorry I feel so dumb for messing up like that, I hate when people lie and I really hope I don't come across like that to you but now I just sound desperate? I'm s o r r y I don't think he'll be online for a while but maybe in a few hours you could try and talk to him about it hello?"
anxiety,"All I have from them is a roof over a head and sometimes food that suits my diet. They won’t talk to me about my problem, they won’t lend me a hand to find a job, they won’t support me with my uni, they won’t even lend me a car to drive to doctors. All I keep hearing is to: go talk to doctors if I’m ill and get antidepressants if I’m depressed. Not realising that neither one will solve my problem. So I thought that maybe someone could help me out with this, maybe someone has similar experience."
stress,"I'm in my last year of my secondary school and we just had our mocks but that doesn't mean you can ease off the gas. I'm constantly rushing about trying to complete coursework by Christmas trying to revise feeling like I'm not putting enough effort in. my room is a tip and every time I try to fully clean it, it's completely wrecked a week later, I eat all my meals whilst revising (in my room) and the only social contact I have is at school I feel like I'm going crazy time is just passing me by and I'm not catching up i'm crying all the time and my health is just gone I'm getting cold after cold and fever after fever. I have no motivation to do anything I only revise because its all I can do. no amount of baths or trying to tidy my room helps what do I do?"
ptsd,"The knowledge that a small part somewhere inside my dad was ...my dad. He was never able to defeat his demons. They destroyed his life and started waging battles in mine. I'll battle PTSD until my last breath. The thoughts, fears, and distorted reality is always hiding in your mind waiting for its chance."
ptsd,"i have horrible vivid nightmares every night. sometimes they're trauma related, but most of the time they're about murder, torture and such depraved things that I can't talk about to anyone. every morning i wake up drenched in sweat, and sometimes vomiting. i have no idea what to do. it's ruining my life."
